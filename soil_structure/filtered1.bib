  abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine the effect of the mucilage
   extracted from Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) as soil amendment on
   soil physical properties and on the sorption-desorption behaviour of
   four herbicides (MCPA, Diuron, Clomazone and Terbuthylazine) used in
   cereal crops. Three soils of different texture (sandy-loam, loam and
   clay-loam) were selected, and mercury intrusion porosimetry and surface
   area analysis were used to examine changes in the microstructural
   characteristics caused by the reactions that occur between the mucilage
   and soil particles. Laboratory studies were conducted to characterise
   the selected herbicides with regard their sorption on tested soils added
   or not with the mucilage.
   Mucilage amendment resulted in a reduction in soil porosity, basically
   due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 10 mu m) and an important
   increase in finer pores (radius < 10 mu m) and in partcles' surface. A
   higher herbicide sorption in the amended soils was ascertained when
   compared to unamended soils. The sorption percentage of herbicides in
   soils treated with mucilage increased in the order; sandy-loam < loam <
   clay-loam.
   The increase in the organic carbon content upon amendment and the
   natural clay content of the soils are revealed to be responsible for the
   higher adsorption of Diuron when compared with Terbuthylazine, Clomazone
   and MCPA. Desorption of the herbicides was highly inhibited in the soils
   treated with mucilage; only Terbuthylazine showed a slight desorption in
   the case of loam and clay loam-soils.
   This study leads to the conclusion thatmucilage from Chia seeds used as
   soil conditioner can reduce the mobility of herbicides tested in
   agricultural soils with different physico-chemical properties. (C) 2017

   groundcovers, particularly the labile fraction. Moreover, soil structure
   and functional soil properties improved through better aggregate
   stability, pore connectivity and infiltration rates. The higher root

   their grain size distribution, namely clay, loamy sand and loamy fine
   sand. The largest impact appeared in the Hapludox, where compaction
   occurred (higher sigma(p), lower c(n) and smaller porosity, especially
   macroporosity). k(s) and K-a were highest at the surface of the Hapludox
   under NF, but were reduced strongly under NT. In both the Hapludox and
   the Hapludalf deeper soil layers were also affected by NT, but in the
   clayey Hapludox the applied pressure resulted in the largest compacted
   layer. The Hapludalf of loamy sand texture showed, supposedly due to
   shallow soil operations, a weak, but permeable surface layer under NT

   cropping systems, the grain yield of wheat crops in the rotation
   stagnates or declines in response to the number of years of continuous
   cropping (YCC). We studied the soil properties underlining the response
   of wheat yield to YCC in 80 on-farm trials during three growing seasons.
   We determined the frontier yield and the yield gap under limited
   (Y-F(-), or best technical means) and unlimited nutrient supply (Y-F(+),
   supplemental additions of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur).
   For each field, we assessed soil quality based on soil organic carbon
   (SOC), phosphorus (Bray I), soil texture, field water infiltration rate
   (INF), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN). We also calculated
   a climatological index (CI) that combines temperature, radiation and
   precipitation during both the spike and early grain growth phases. We
   estimated Y-F(-) and Y(F)(+)using stochastic frontier production
   functions with CI, YCC and soil properties as predictor variables. The
   Y-F(-) and Y-F(+) after a perennial pasture were 6.9 and 8.4 Mg ha(-1),
   with the 1.5 Mg ha(-1) yield gap attributable to nutrient supply
   limitations. However, while Y-F(-) declined by 0.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) from
   YCC = 1 to 10 (P <= 0.05), Y-F(+) stayed at roughly the same level till
   YCC = 5, declining thereafter by 0.17 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (P <= 0.05).
   Reduced soil nutrient supply capacity, partially quantified as PMN and
   amendable with supplemental fertilization, limited 17 during the first
   five years after pasture. The subsequent 17 decline could not be
   compensated by increased nutrient supply. After 10 years, the yield gap
   between Y-F(+) for YCC = 1 and Y-F(-) for YCC = 10, increased to 2.6 Mg
   ha(-1). Up to 40\% of this gap was explained by a deterioration of the
   soil quality that was independent of the nutrient supply; the decline
   after five years of continuous cropping was best explained by INF. Thus,
   continuous annual cropping under no-till generated a progressive
   increase in the wheat yield gap associated to deterioration in soil
   quality that could be corrected with supplemental fertilization only in
   the first years after a pasture, but not thereafter, when soil physical
   properties seemed to degrade past a threshold that limited wheat yield
   and reduced nutrient use efficiency.}},

   Subsequently, soil quality indicators have not yet been established for
   Chilean volcanic soils. Hence, the aim of this study was to select a set
   of soil quality indicators to evaluate changes in Chilean volcanic
   soils, mainly due to land use, but also considering seasonal changes.
   Thus, three soils derived from volcanic materials were sampled (with
   different intrinsic properties), on five sampling dates, under three
   land uses (intensities): native forest (NF), prairie (P) and crops (C).
   Soil samples were taken to evaluate both chemical (disturbed samples)
   and physical (undisturbed cylinders and soil blocks) properties. A total
   of 27 soil properties were measured and/or calculated, among these are:
   penetration resistance, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air
   conductivity, bulk density, total porosity pore size distribution,
   aggregate stability, pH, nutrient contents, Al saturation, effective
   cation exchange capacity, soil organic carbon and extractable Al. To
   effectively select the indicators a multivariate analysis (PCA) was
   performed. The proposed set of indicators for soils derived from
   volcanic materials include: i) bulk density, ii) plant available water
   pores in volcanic soils, iii) wide coarse pores, iv) air conductivity at
   6 kPa, v) soil organic carbon, vi) extractable Al with ammonium acetate,
   vii) pH in water, viii) P Olsen and ix) base sum. Main difference in

   others a chisel plough (RT1) and a disc harrow (RT2) were employed. In
   October 2014, the entire field was mouldboard ploughed. The following
   year, four field campaigns were conducted to compare the soil physical

   affected by one-time inversion tillage (RT1 and RT2). Dry bulk density
   (DBD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and infiltration rate

   suggests that improved soil hydraulic properties remained after one-time

   energy crop Sida hermaphrodita for its potential to be cultivated on
   marginal substrate and conventional agricultural soils over a three-year
   field and mesocosm experiment at agricultural conditions. Furthermore,
   we aimed for a closed nutrient loop by fertilizing plants with biogas

   amendment to ameliorate the overall soil fertility. As controls, plants
   were either untreated or fertilized with an equivalent amount of mineral
   NPK fertilizer. We found S. hermaphrodita to give highest DM yields of
   up to 28 t ha(-1) under favorable soil conditions when fertilized with
   mineral NPK. However, on marginal substrate digestate fertilization
   resulted in a clear biomass yield advantage over NPK fertilization. An
   increased soil carbon content, water holding capacity and basal soil

   spirit, this study assessed soil quality indicators on
   glyphosate-sprayed fields under natural (NC) and zero tillage conditions
   (ZT) in Northwest Argentina, to analyze the effect of the herbicide
   application on soil degradation. The ZT soils underwent five years of
   continuous spraying (2-4 times a year) after land clearing, while the NC
   soil, without any laboring practices, was subjected to two consecutive
   applications. Among the measured indicators (physical, chemical, and
   biological), water-stable aggregates (WSA), particulate organic matter
   (POM) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) showed quality differences
   between ZT and NC samples. The highest values were found in NC (WSA
   72\%; POM 4.9\%; DHA 1460 mg TPF/g(soil)/d) and the lowest in ZT (WSA
   13\%; POM 1.69\%; DHA 180 mg TPF/g(soil)/d); showing a lower quality in
   ZT regarding structure stability, nutrient availability and microbial
   activity. A Discriminant Analysis revealed that as glyphosate
   application increased, the overall soil quality decreased within the NC
   samples, resembling that of ZT. Thus, soil health deterioration was
   attributed solely to glyphosate spraying in NC. Furthermore,
   multivariate analysis allowed identification of chemical indicators as
   of higher sensitivity to the short-term response after application, and
   biological indicators as more sensitive to long-term changes. The
   quality decline in time in the NC soil, caused by the use of
   glyphosate-based herbicides, could endanger the soils sustainability.}},

   numerous social, cultural, and environmental benefits. Many marginal
   zones grazed for centuries are now suffering from abandonment, which has
   been found to be interrelated with species and functional diversity
   loss, and has potential consequences for the provision of ecosystem
   services such as soil fertility and soil carbon storage. We sampled soil
   and plant species abundance in a total of 64 plots (5 x 5 m), in wet and
   dry habitats under different grazing regimes (from moderate grazing to
   grazing abandonment for at least 30 years) in Central Spain. We tested
   the influence of grazing intensity and water availability on different
   variables related to soil fertility and also on soil carbon storage. In
   addition, Community weighted mean and Rao quadratic entropy were
   calculated for two effect traits (specific leaf area and plant height),
   in order to assess the ultimate effects of these functional attributes
   on multifunctionality (i.e., the provision of several simultaneous
   ecosystem functions). We found that grazing abandonment generally
   produces a reduction in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available
   potassium and phosphorus, aggregate stability and soil carbon storage.
   In addition, grazing abandonment had a negative effect on soil texture
   with loss of fine particles (clay and silt) and water holding capacity,
   but only in dry habitats and in longer-term abandoned situation. In
   general, soil multifunctionality was higher in wet than dry habitats,
   decreased with grazing abandonment in both habitats. Soil
   multifunctionality was indirectly mediated by the functional structure
   of size and leaf traits of the local plant communities, but our results
   suggested that macroscale grazing effects, i.e. translocation of
   nutrients by grazers among habitats via dung and urine deposition, might
   be important mechanisms that influence soil multifunctionality at the
   local level. Agri-environmental policies should be aware of the risk of
   widespread grazing abandonment and take advantage of the benefits of
   low-intensity grazing regimes for ecosystem services such as soil
   fertility and stability, and soil carbon storage.}},

  abstract = {{Soil air exchange is one of the most important soil functions that
   directly impacts on crop productivity and environment. Generally,
   conservation agriculture (CA) practices are expected to provide improved
   soil aeration but contrasting texture-related effects were found in the
   literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CA
   practices on gas transport characteristics in the silty soils of the
   Veneto Region (North-Eastern Italy). In 2010, a field experiment
   comparing CA practices (no-tillage, cover crop and residues retention)
   to conventional intensive tillage (IT) system was established in four
   farms located in the Veneto low plain. In fall 2015, 144 undisturbed 100
   cm(3) soil cores where collected at two different layers (3-6.5 cm and
   20-23.5 cm) and analysed for air-filled porosity, air permeability, gas
   diffusivity and soil structure indices derived.
   Gas transport measurements highlighted low transmission properties of
   the silty soils independently from agronomic management. Both air
   permeability and relative gas diffusivity showed poor aerated conditions
   being generally < 20 mu m(2) and < 0.005, respectively.
   CA treatments affected the transmission properties only in the coarsest
   soil studied causing a reduction of air permeability in the deeper layer
   and relative gas diffusivity in both layers. The CA-induced reduction
   was related to the tillage effect on soil bulk density and suggested
   that CA not only affected the air-filled porosity but also continuity
   and tortuosity characteristics.
   The poor structural stability of Veneto soils, particularly the poor
   soil organic carbon content, could prevent the exploitation of CA
   practices firstly on soil structure and in turn on gas exchanges. For
   these reasons further studies elucidating the mechanisms improving soil
   structural conditions for silty soils as those examined in this study

   5 Mg ha(-1) + poultry manure 5 Mg ha(-1). Grain yields of maize and
   rapeseed under CT were similar to those under NT. Mulching had a
   significant effect on the productivity of maize and rapeseed. Mulching
   treatment MA5P5, MF10 and MA10 produced significantly (p = 0.05) higher
   yield of maize and rapeseed than that of other treatments. Maize and
   rapeseed productivity under control was the lowest. There was a marked

   Handheld mini disk infiltrometer at a steady-state flow of 2 cm water

   addition, the effects of antecedent soil moisture contents (MC), soil
   bulk density (BD), total porosity (FT), soil water holding capacity
   (WHC), organic matter content (SOM), and cation exchange capacity (CEC)
   on soil hydrophobicity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and

   decreasing trend in the order: natural forest (>) plantation
   agriculture(>) croplands, whereas, mean hydraulic conductivity values
   showed an increasing trend in the order: natural forest < plantation
   agriculture < croplands. Hydraulic conductivity resulted to a negative
   correlation with hydrophobicity among all sampled soils. In all the
   sampled soils, index of soil hydrophobicity (R) correlated significantly
   (p <= 0.01) with organic matter content, organic carbon and cation

  abstract = {{No-tillage has become a universal management system to conserve soil
   water and sustain soil productivity in dryland agriculture. However,
   no-tillage in a long-term may produce some undesirable soil
   characteristics. An occasional tillage operation has been used as a mean
   to manage some of the defects that have emerged in NT farming systems.
   This study was to explore the effect of sub-soiling at different
   frequencies in a no-tillage farming system of an annual cropping system
   of winter wheat-spring maize rotation on Loess Plateau. The study
   consisted of three tillage practices: NT (no-tillage were applied every
   year), NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first year and rotated with
   sub-soiling in second year), NT/NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first
   two year and rotated with sub-soiling in third year). The study began in
   2007 on a former spring maize field with conventional tillage and lasted
   for three-year rotation cycles by 2016. In ten years, for the soil
   physical properties, NT/ST rotation significantly decreased soil bulk
   density, and increased soil porosity and amount of macroaggregates ( >
   0.25 mm) when compared to NT (P < 0.05). For water storage, NT with ST
   rotations (NT/ST \&NT/NT/ST) increased the soil water storage in the
   fallow periods. Moreover, NT/ST rotation produced higher average grain
   yields, WUE and economic profit in the winter wheat-spring maize
   cropping system when compared to NT over the ten years. However, the
   soil organic matter (SOM) and total N under NT with ST rotations (NT/ST
   \& NT/NT/ ST) were lower than it for NT. For this long-term experiment,
   NT provided a better soil nutrient condition, NT/ NT/ST and NT/ST
   rotation showed a better effect on soil water storage in fallow. For the
   comprehensive productivity, NT/ST rotation showed a balanced soil
   properties and crop production effect among three tillage treatments. In
   the winter wheat-spring maize cropping system, NT/ST rotation enhanced
   soil physical and chemical properties and increased yield and water
   holding capacity of soil. We predict that the NT/ST rotation will be of
   great significance in promoting the development of rain-fed conservation
   farming in the Loess Plateau of China.}},

   We investigated how the repeated application of different types of
   agricultural (liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure) and urban
   waste fertilizers (sewage sludge and composted organic household waste)
   affected soil physical properties, colloid dispersion from aggregates,
   tracer transport, and colloid leaching from intact soil cores. Total
   porosity was positively correlated with SOC content. Yearly applications
   of sewage sludge increased absolute microporosity (pores <30 mu m) and
   decreased relative macroporosity (pores >30 mu m) compared with the
   unfertilized control, whereas organic household waste compost
   fertilization increased both total porosity and the absolute porosity in
   all pore size classes (though not significant for 100-600 mu m).
   Treatments receiving large amounts of organic fertilizers exhibited
   significantly lower levels of dispersible colloids compared with an
   unfertilized control and a treatment that had received moderate
   applications of cattle slurry. The content of water-dispersible colloids
   could not be explained by a single factor, but differences in SOC
   content, electrical conductivity, and sodium adsorption ratio were
   important factors. Moreover, we found that the fertilizer treatments did
   not significantly affect the solute transport properties of the topsoil.
   Finally, we found that the leaching of soil colloids was significantly
   decreased in treatments that had received large amounts of organic waste

  abstract = {{In European Union countries, disposal sewage sludge on agricultural
   lands is restricted by directives. Large-area degradation of surface
   soils in Europe is a major challenge to maintain and remediate due to
   their size and geomorphology, different historical uses and current
   biogeochemical conditions. These sites are often degraded with a mixture
   of contaminants mostly lacking a biologically active topsoil. The use of
   sewage sludge to restore such sites with soil organic matter and stabile
   plant cover have for long been explored, but the application is
   restricted by the chemical quality of the sewage sludge. Hence we
   designed a study to investigate the effect of a one-time amendment of a
   low-metal contaminated sewage sludge on a barren and contaminated soil
   to immobilize harmful trace metals and obtain sustainable plant cover.
   The present study was aimed to create plant cover on a barren soil by a
   single application of sewage sludge through the process of
   phytostabilization. The field experiment was conducted in the
   contaminated area near a zinc smelter with high metal concentration
   (cadmium, zinc, lead) and poor soil fertility. A single application of
   sewage sludge from food industry was made and forest species of Scots
   pine (Pinus silvestris L), Norway spruce (Picea abies L) and oak
   (Quercus robur L) were used for phytoremediation. It was found that
   single application of sewage sludge was beneficial for development of
   plant cover and after a five years a significant increase in the biomass
   of trees (mainly spruce and pine) was achieved. Moreover, in the amended
   plots, the growth of various species of grasses, dicotyledonous plants,
   and spontaneous growth of birch was also observed. On control plots with
   no sewage sludge application, the planted trees gradually withered away
   during the same period. Sewage sludge from food industry provided plant
   nutrients effectively utilized by the plants. Its application also
   increased the water holding capacity in the test plots due to it
   contribution to soil organic matter. Compared to the control plots, the
   content of macroelements and carbon in soil was still higher at the end
   of the 5 year study. The high content of bioavailable macroelements in
   sewage sludge, poses a potential threat to their leaching and run-off
   into groundwater, contributing to the emergence of eutrophication of
   water bodies. However, the results of the experiments showed that the
   gradual release of macronutrients from sewage sludge were fully used by
   plants to stimulate their growth and development. The content of
   cadmium, zinc and lead in plant biomass was much lower compared to
   untreated plants. Also for treated plants the heavy metals were mainly
   accumulated in roots. The data from this field trial provided results
   supporting the use of high quality sewage sludge amendment for
   remediation of contaminated and barren soils, and large scale trials
   should be followed up on various degraded soil types. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   monoculture others have intensified the land-use by increasing the
   number and diversity in the crop sequence. The effects of this
   intensification, in terms of soil structural quality, are contradictory,
   possibly caused by the increase of machinery traffic. In order to assess
   soil structural quality and the performance of selected
   morpho-structural variables with different levels of intensification, we
   analyzed plots under NT with high and low crop sequence intensification
   (Good -GAP- and Poor -PAP-, agricultural practices respectively) and
   reference plots in four soils (two Argiudolls, an Haplustoll and an
   Hapludert) of the Argentinian Pampean region. The morpho-structural
   variables assessed were Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure at field
   scale (VESS), visible porosity (Vp), roundness (Rd), eccentricity (Ecc)
   and 3-D aggregate features (faces, corners and edges). Plots with higher
   frequency of cereals in the sequence (GAP) presented on average higher
   VESS scores, higher Vp values and less rounded aggregates with more
   faces and corners, suggesting that crop sequence intensification induces
   favorable structural features. VESS, Vp, number of faces and corners
   were strongly correlated with aggregate stability tests mainly with the
   fast and fast(10s) test (r: -0.56, -0.74; 0.48, 0.52; 0.46, 0.49 and

   examined, concerning aggregates and pores were sensitive to changes in
   crop sequence and are useful soil quality indicators. However, the
   occurrence of platy structures also under GAP shows the need to adjust
   the VESS method to the NT system. Besides, the effect of agricultural
   intensification on soil morphology was modulated by soil type. In
   consequence, this last factor has also to be considered for the
   definition of a quality indicator to track the effect of crop sequences
   intensification under no-till management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   riparian cool season grass (CSG) buffer in central Iowa, USA. To achieve
   our objective, we compared the functioning of the target system, ARC,
   with a system that has been undisturbed since 1990, CSG. We measured the
   aggregate size distribution and stability of macroaggregrates,
   aggregate-associated soil organic carbon and particulate organic matter
   (POM). The categorization of aggregates by size and water stability
   (slaking resistance) showed a significantly larger (P<0.05) proportion
   of water-stable macroaggregates (> 250 mu m) under CSG (53\%) than under
   ARC (26.3\%). On the other hand, soil under ARC had the larger
   proportion of large and small water-unstablemacroaggregates. The results
   indicate that the concentration of organic C associated with the total
   water-stable aggregates is 1.9 times greater under CSG (23.9 mgC g(-1))
   than for the ARC (12.4 mgC g(-1)). The concentration of carbon in light
   particulate organic matter (LPOM-C) under CSG accounted for 12\% of
   total soil organic carbon (TSOC), but only 6\% under ARC management. The
   chemical composition of LPOM in the ARC soil had a large alkyl-C/O-alkyl
   C ratio, which suggests more organic matter decomposition than with the
   CSG. Electronic micrographs showed evidence that under CSG roots and
   fungal hyphae form an extensive network around the large macroaggregates
   (> 2000 mu m), and thus maintain the stability of the macroaggregates.
   Preserving the CSG buffer reduces soil erosion and the processes

   crops used during 4 years as mono cropping system, covered by either
   straw or black polyethylene (plastic mulching). Soil physicochemical
   properties included water content, pH, effective cation exchange
   capacity, elemental analysis of total carbon and nitrogen, dissolved and
   total organic carbon, and soil stability by percentage of water-stable
   aggregates (>0.2 mm). Soil microbial analysis comprised soil microbial
   biomass (C-mic and N-mic and DNA concentrations) and estimation of soil
   eco-physiological conditions C-mic:C-org and N-mic:N-tot. Soil bacteria
   and a fraction of cultivable fungi were studied respectively by
   molecular analysis and counting of colony forming units (CFU values).
   Mycotoxin concentration in soil (deoxynivalenol) was used as an indirect
   indicator of fungal stress. The plastic mulching system showed positive
   effects on soil physicochemical properties as compared to straw
   mulching: Higher soil carbon content and better aggregate stability were
   observed in soils under plastic film, and the values for soil microbial
   biomass were comparable in both systems. Yet, soil eco-physiological
   conditions under plastic mulching were less appropriate compared to
   straw, as reflected by a reduced C-mic:C-org ratio (1.3 +/- 0.3\%),
   followed by a decline of the number of bacteria (18\%), a six-fold
   reduction of the biomass of soil cultivable fungi, and finally by a
   two-times higher deoxynivalenol concentration in soil (mean 2.2 +/- 2.4

   less favourable soil conditions and that the production of mycotoxins
   can be understood as a stress induced response by fungi. Further

   the treatment (T-7) receiving in-situ residue decomposition of sugarcane
   crop residues in combination with equal proportion (50\%) of press mud
   cake and biomethanated spent wash over the burning of sugarcane crop
   residues and removal of stubbles after harvest of maize. After harvest
   of maize the maximum recalcitrant fraction (humic acid) of carbon was
   observed in the treatment T-7 (in-situ decomposition of sugarcane crop
   residues + 50\% press-mud cake + 50\% biomethenated spent wash). This
   study clearly indicated that resistant fraction of carbon might be
   accumulated more where decomposed organic matter was applied regularly.
   It clearly indicated that application of in-situ decomposed residues and
   by-products of industrial waste in combination with NPK enhanced the
   below and above ground biomass production, SOC stock and carbon pools.}},

   assessed the effects of plastic-film mulch on soil aggregate water
   stability and pH in fields used for maize (Zea mays L.) production, at
   two sites in a cold semiarid environment, China. Four treatments were
   used: (i) no plastic-film mulch and no straw incorporation, (ii)
   plastic-film mulch only, (iii) straw incorporation only, and (iv) straw
   incorporation plus mulch. Seven years after continuous treatment
   application, the use of plastic-film mulch increased the proportion of
   water-stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) in the top 15-cm soil layer by
   16-28\%, across sampling times and sites. Straw incorporation similarly
   increased the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates. However, the
   effects of mulch, on increasing the mean weight diameter of aggregates
   were greater in non-straw-incorporated soils than in straw-incorporated
   soils, and vice versa. Soil bulk density in the top 15-cm soil layer
   marginally increased in the mulched treatments, relative to the
   non-mulched treatments, while it decreased in straw-incorporated
   treatments. In addition, there was a decrease in soil pH, by 0.19-0.54
   units, in the mulched, relative to the non-mulched soils. Combining our
   previous results, we suggested that increases in maize root growth and
   microbial activity were linked to the increased soil aggregation while
   accumulation in soil nitrate resulting from the stimulated soil nitrogen
   mineralization was responsible for the marginally decreased soil pH in
   the plastic-film mulched relative to the non mulched soils, due to
   increased soil hydrothermal conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   carbon (C) storage and water regulation, are under threat due to
   encroachment and replacement of these natural forests by drainage-based
   agriculture, commonly oil palm.plantation. This study aims to quantify
   how the chemical and physical properties of peat change during land
   conversion to oil palm. This will be addressed by comparing four
   separate stages of conversion; namely, secondary peat swamp forests,
   recently deeply drained secondary forests, cleared and recently planted
   oil palm, and mature oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia.
   Results indicate accelerated peat decomposition in surface peats of
   mature oil palm plantations due to the lowered water table and altered
   litter inputs associated with this land-use change. Surface organic
   matter content and peat C stocks at secondary forest sites were higher
   than at mature oil palm sites (e.g. C stocks were 975 +/- 151 and 497
   +/- 157 Mg ha(-1) at secondary forest and mature oil palm sites,
   respectively). Land conversion altered peat physical properties such as
   shear strength, bulk density and porosity, with mirrored changes above
   and below the water table. Our findings suggest close links between the
   organic matter and C content and peat physical properties through the
   entire depth of the peat profile. We have demonstrated that conversion
   from secondary peat swamp forest to mature oil palm plantation may
   seriously compromise C storage and, through its impact on peat physical
   properties, the water holding capacity in these peatlands. (C) 2016

  abstract = {{Agricultural activities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and contribute to
   global warming. Intensive plough tillage (PT), use of agricultural
   chemicals and the burning of crop residues are major farm activities
   emitting GHGs. Intensive PT also degrades soil properties by reducing
   soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. In this scenario, adoption of no-till
   (NT) systems offers a pragmatic option to improve soil properties and
   reduce GHG emission. We evaluated the impacts of tillage systems (NT and
   PT) and wheat residue mulch on soil properties and GHG emission. This
   experiment was started in 1989 on a Crosby silt loam soil at Waterman
   Farm, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. Mulching reduced
   soil bulk density and improved total soil porosity. More total carbon
   (16.16 g kg(-1)), SOC (8.36 mg L-1) and soil microbial biomass carbon
   (152 mu g g(-1)) were recorded in soil under NT than PT. Mulch
   application also decreased soil temperature (0-5cm) and penetration
   resistance (0-60cm). Adoption of long-term NT reduced the GHG emission.
   Average fluxes of GHGs under NT were 1.84g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for

   water-stable aggregates, permeability, plastic limit, pH in water, pH in
   KCl, organic matter, P2O5 and K2O. The sugarcane yield components such
   as cane yield (tha(-1)) and sucrose yield (tha(-1)) were evaluated.
   Principal components analysis and simple regression analysis were also
   performed. Both organic matter and water-stable aggregates were closely
   related to cane yield, with r values of 0.87-0.97. The properties with
   best responses to treatments over time were permeability, water-stable
   aggregates, degree of soil aggregation and organic matter; therefore,

   nutrient cycling in agroecosystems: reduced runoff and erosion, reduced
   leaching, improved soil carbon storage, enhanced microbial biomass, low
   greenhouse gas emissions, improved water holding capacity, and high
   yields. We evaluated these metrics in six farm management practices:
   intercrops, agroforestry, cover crops, organic amendments, integrated
   crop-livestock, and conservation tillage. Agroforestry and cover crops
   consistently reduced runoff and erosion and improved carbon
   sequestration compared to conventional systems. Agroforestry was the
   only practice that consistently reduced nutrient leaching over
   conventional practices. Organic amendments and conservation tillage
   improve water holding capacity. There exists uncertainty in the
   effectiveness of these practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.
   Finally, although agroforestry tends to suppress yields, all of the
   practices had either a neutral or positive effect on yields. Evaluating

  abstract = {{Soil is currently seen as the most relevant carbon sink and the most
   effective carbon stabilizer. In contrast, agriculture is the second
   largest C emitter, after burning of fossil fuels. This organic carbon
   (OC) introduced into the soil, mainly via organic matter (OM), is
   essential for several soil properties and plays an extremely important
   role in sandy soils. The objective of this study was to describe the
   changes in the amounts and pools of OC and the influence thereof on some
   physical soil properties in areas converted from pasture to eucalyptus.
   The following areas were analyzed: a degraded pasture (PAST), two areas
   of pasture-eucalyptus conversion after 2 and 15 years (EU02 and EU15,
   respectively) and a preserved Cerrado area (CER) in the east of the
   state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Soil samples were taken from the 0.00-0.05,
   0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.30 m layers. The OC was measured and analyzed, the
   carbon pool (CP) calculated, aggregate stability, bulk density (BD), and
   macro-and microporosity determined, and total porosity (TP) calculated
   to analyze the influence of land use on soil properties. The
   experimental design was completely randomized, and four clusters per
   area were established, with nine subsampling points, for a total of 36
   subsamples per area, organized in 20 x 20 m grids, The soil under
   natural vegetation (preserved Cerrado) was used as a control. The change
   from CER to commercial cultivation accelerates the process of OC loss
   (reductions of 25-35 \%) and reductions in soil physical quality. In the
   PAST area, OC was reduced by 30 \% in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. Cumulative
   OC and CP were highest in the 0.00-0.05 m layer and decreased in the
   deeper layers in all land use treatments. Organic C in the 0.10-0.30 m
   layer was not influenced by land use, indicating the possibility of OC
   persistence in the soil for longer periods. Macroporosity and total
   porosity may be considered appropriate in CER and EU15, whereas the
   conditions for plant development in PAST and EU02 were restrictive. Land
   use systems reduced OC and the CP, indicating anthropogenic disturbance
   of the soil compared to CER. Fifteen years after planting eucalyptus in
   the pasture area, signs of recovery of some soil physical properties
   were observed, e.g., reduced BD and increased TP.}},

   organic matter content, poor soil structure, high erodibility, soil
   acidity, and aluminum toxicity, have affected their productive capacity.
   Lime and gypsum are commonly used to improve soil chemical fertility,
   but no information exists about the long-term effects of these products
   on the physical attributes and C protection mechanisms of highly
   weathered Oxisols. A field trial was conducted in a sandy clay loam
   (kaolinitic, thermic Typic Haplorthox) under a no-tillage system for 12
   years. The trial consisted of four treatments: a control with no soil
   amendment application, the application of 2.1 Mg ha (-1) phosphogypsum,
   the application of 2.0 Mg ha(-1) lime, and the application of lime +
   phosphogypsum (2.0 + 2.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Since the experiment
   was established in 2002, the rates have been applied three times (2002,
   2004, and 2010). Surface liming effectively increased water-stable
   aggregates > 2.0 mm at a depth of up to 0.2 m; however, the association
   with phosphogypsum was considered a good strategy to improve the
   macroaggregate stability in subsoil layers (0.20 to 0.40 m).
   Consequently, both soil amendments applied together increased the mean
   weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) in all soil
   layers, with increases of up to 118 and 89\%, respectively, according to
   the soil layer. The formation and stabilization of larger aggregates
   contributed to a higher accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC) on
   these structures. In addition to TOC, the MWD and aggregate stability
   index were positively correlated with Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels and base
   saturation. Consequently, the increase observed in the aggregate size
   class resulted in a better organization of soil particles, increasing
   the macroporosity and reducing the soil bulk density and penetration
   resistance. Therefore, adequate soil chemical management plays a
   fundamental role in improving the soil's physical attributes in tropical

   monoculture of winter wheat with a single application in 1992 of lignite
   dust (WW + L), monoculture of alfalfa with orchard grass in the

   collected from each treatment: 12 soil cores for soil water and air
   properties; 6-kg composite bulk samples for basic physical and chemical
   properties of soil; 1 undisturbed soil block for structure analysis. The
   reclamation methods applied on the post-mining grounds influenced in a
   diverse manner the physical state of the 0-10 cm layer of the developed
   technogenic soil. Bulk density values generally decreased with the
   increase of number of factors potentially loosening the soil structure.

   no manure). Treatments were distributed in a randomized block design.
   Factors analysed were stability against wetting stress disaggregation,

   studied eight months after the last manure application. The application
   rate of 30DCM increased aggregate stability and the light SOC fraction,

   The DCM rates did not result in unbalanced agronomic advantages versus
   MNF, as high yields (12-16 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were obtained. In
   Mediterranean environments, the use of DCM should be encouraged mainly

   N were determined and data were analyzed statistically. The highest SOC
   and N percentages were found in AGF and the lowest in RC.
   beta-Glucosidase activity was not significantly different among AGF,
   GWW, and RC. beta-Glucosaminidase and dehydrogenase activities were
   significantly lower in RC treatment than all other treatments.
   Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity was not significant among
   all treatments. WSA percentage was significantly higher in GWW and AGF
   as compared to others. Landscape position was not significantly
   different for all measured soil quality parameters. beta-Glucosidase,
   beta-glucosaminidase activities, WSA, and soil N did not differ
   significantly with distance from the tree base. SOC and FDA hydrolase

  abstract = {{Maize-based crop rotations are advocated as alternate to rice-based
   systems in South Asia due to better suitability for diverse ecologies,
   higher yields with less water use and more palatable maize fodder

   industries. Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are
   important management strategies for tackling the issues of soil health
   deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources,
   particularly in rice based intensive crop rotations. The conservation
   agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as
   zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to
   enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties
   for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term study was
   conducted to evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03)
   and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic
   carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic
   activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western
   India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, PB and conventional
   tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based
   crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS:
   Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-MustardMungbean, MMS:
   Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC,
   physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7
   years of continuous ZT, PB and CT in diversified maize rotations.
   Compared to Cr plots, the soil physical properties like water stable
   aggregates (WSA) > 250 mu m were 16.1-32.5\% higher, and bulk density
   (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P < 0.05)
   decline (11.0-14.3 and 11.2-12.0\%) in ZT and PB plots at 0-15 and 15-30
   cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34.6-35.3\%
   at 0-15 cm, and 23.6-26.5\% at 15-30 cm soil depths with conservation
   agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT.
   Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under CA based
   systems increased by 45-48.9\% in 0-30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam
   (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P < 0.05) improvement in soil
   enzymatic activities i.e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, beta
   Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the CA based
   treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) synergistic effects of summer legumes
   (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were
   observed on SOC,WSA, BD, PR and Ksat at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths.
   Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P <
   0.05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic
   activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that CA based crop
   management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and

   partial substitutes for conventional inorganic fertilization (CIF) was
   evaluated in two successive crops of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), one of
   the most consumed vegetables in Europe. The aim was to offer alternative
   agricultural practices that are more environmentally friendly.
   Treatments consisting of various rates of inorganic and organic
   fertilizers (composts) were assayed in quadruplicate on a sandy loam
   soil classified as Haplic Calcisol in Southern Spain. Macro- and
   micronutrients and heavy metal concentrations were analysed in soil and
   plant leaves. Parameters such as soil basal respiration (BR), microbial
   biomass C (C-mic) and dehydrogenase (DHA) and hydrolase activities,
   indicators of soil microbial abundance and activity, were also
   determined after each crop. After the second lettuce crop, certain
   physical soil properties such as aggregate stability and soil water
   holding capacity were also determined. In the first crop lettuce yields
   in the compost-treated soils did not significantly (p <= 0.05) differ
   from the yields of CIF-treated soils. In the second crop, however,
   lettuce yields were higher in organically treated soils than in soils
   receiving only inorganic fertilization. Organic fertilizers were able to
   supply sufficient nutrients to achieve similar yields as those obtained
   with additional inorganic fertilizer. After the second, crop,
   organically treated soils also showed higher C, N, P concentrations and
   higher C-mic, BR and DHA than soils receiving conventional inorganic
   fertilization as well as improved physical conditions (a higher
   percentage of stable soil aggregates and a greater water holding
   capacity). Also after the second lettuce crop, compost-treated soils
   showed significantly higher beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activity
   than CIF-treated soils. Furthermore, lettuces grown in compost treated
   soils showed significantly lower leaf nitrate concentration than
   lettuces grown in soil receiving CIF, thus reducing the potential
   toxicological risks associated with consuming nitrate-rich foods.
   Moreover, compost fertilization did not increase the concentration of
   heavy metals in lettuce leaves. Results confirm that manure and sewage
   sludge composts can be used as an alternative to inorganic fertilization
   in lettuce crop cultivation, leading to similar or even higher yields
   and reducing nutrient leaching risks, while improving soil chemical,

   rotation on a semiarid subtropical soil to study the influence of
   conservation agriculture (CA) practices vis-a-vis conventional tillage
   (CT) on some soil physical, chemical and biological attributes of soil
   health. Application of fertilizer N, P, farmyard manure (FYM) and crop
   residues (CR) significantly increased water-stable aggregates and had
   profound effect in increasing the mean weight diameter as well as the
   formation of macro-aggregates. After 2 years of soybean-rapeseed
   rotation under CA practices, the formation of macro-aggregates was the
   highest in both surface (84 \%) and subsurface (80 \%) soil layers with
   application of 20 kg N+60 kg P2O5 + 10 t FYM+4t rapeseed residue ha(-1)
   applied to soybean and 100 kg N+30 kg P2O5+3 t soybean residue ha(-1)
   applied to rapeseed crop, respectively, and the corresponding values in
   CT were 83 and 77 \%. The same treatment also enhanced total organic C
   from 4.5 g kg(-1) in control to 6.4 g kg(-1) in surface layer and from
   3.3 to 4.4 g kg(-1) in subsurface layer after 4 years in CA practices.
   Other soil health attributes like labile C and N fractions such as
   water-soluble C (38.9 mg kg(-1)), particulate (1483 mg kg(-1)) and light
   fraction (209 mg kg(-1)) organic matter, potentially mineralizable N
   (23.3 mg kg(-1) 7d(-1)) and microbial biomass carbon (283 mg kg(-1))
   were also the highest under this integrated inorganic and organic
   treatment in conjunction with no tillage (CA practices). These results
   suggest that CA that integrates application of inorganic fertilizer,
   organic manure, retention of CR as soil cover, and minimum tillage is
   tremendously beneficial for soil health due to its positive effects on
   aggregation processes, augmenting organic matter accumulation and
   protecting within soil aggregates, and significantly enhancing
   biological pools in semiarid subtropical soils.}},

   traditional intensive rice monoculture with three rice crops per year

   contrasting grazing intensities in the Karoo biome, South Africa. The
   aim of this studywas to investigate impacts of long-term (>75 years)
   grazing at 1.18 heads ha(-1) (heavy; CGH), 0.78 heads ha(-1) (light;
   CGL), and exclosure on selected soil properties. Soil samples were
   collected to a depth of 60 cm from the long-term experimental site of
   Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute, Eastern Cape. The
   samples were analyzed for C, N, bulk density and infiltration rate,
   among others.
   RESULTS: Generally, heavy and light grazing reduced soil N storage by
   27.5\% and 22.6\%, respectively, compared with the exclosure. Animal
   exclusion improved water infiltration rate and C stocks significantly (P
   < 0.05), which was 0.128, 0.097, and 0.093 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for
   exclosure, CGL and CGH, respectively. Soil penetration resistance was
   higher for grazing treatments in the top 3-7 cm soil layer but for
   exclosure at the top 1 cmsoil surface.
   CONCLUSION: Although livestock exclusion has the potential to improve C
   sequestration, a sufficient resting period for 1-2 years followed by
   three consecutive grazing years at light stocking rate would be ideal
   for sustainable livestock production in this arid region of South
   Africa. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry}},

   content resulted in decreased bulk density, and also in increased

   vegetation). Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected in
   three soil layers (0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 m) with four replicates.
   The following physical properties were analyzed: particle-size
   distribution, soil bulk and particle densities, and soil water retention
   curve. The coefficient of intrinsic soil air permeability was calculated
   based on the equation that considers the decreasing pressure method.
   Soil porosity, pore continuity index and blocked porosity were
   calculated and pore length was estimated. Compared with the native
   forest, pore network quality is improved, if not maintained, when the
   soil is cultivated under the conditions described in this experiment. In
   the conditions of cultivation, the application of bovine biofertilizer,
   for supplying sediments that block or reduce the size of the pores, did
   not improve soil air permeability. The cases where pore network quality
   was worsened in soil porosity as a result of the applied treatments

   These changes are slow therefore the use of indicators for dating the

   in Madrid, Spain with the aim to establish for the first time the use of
   Retama sphaerocarpa L. (Boiss) as a dendrochronological tool for dating
   land abandonment. This offers the possibility to take into consideration
   a period of time long enough for changes in soil to be determined. Such
   changes can be indicated by fluctuations in soil organic carbon content
   (SOC), porosity or water availability. Three different situations
   resulted from the dendrochronological analysis: soil currently tilled;
   soil recently abandoned (less than 5 years), and prolonged abandonment
   (in average 10 years). In addition the influence of Retama sphaerocarpa
   L. (Boiss) on soils was checked for these periods of abandonment. The
   rate of SOC gain can be considered fast. Tilled soils accounted for
   0.48\% SOC, and reached 1\% in less than 5 years, although with wide
   standard deviations. Due to prolonged abandonment SOC reached 1.41\%, (P
   = 0.09). Total soil porosity under tillage was 49\%, and decreased to
   38\% after 4-5 years, but recovered to 41\% under prolonged abandonment.
   Water availability (volumetric soil moisture between field capacity and
   permanent wilting point) remained the same, ranging from 7.7 to 8.5\%
   along the whole period of time. The presence of R. sphaerocarpa L.

  abstract = {{Rice-maize system (RMS) is emerging as dominant option for
   diversification of existing rice-wheat systems in Asia due to better
   suitability and higher yields of maize compared to wheat after long
   duration rice cultivars, and increasing demand of maize from poultry and
   fish industries. The conventional practice of cultivation of RMS is
   input intensive, deteriorates soil health and is less profitable.
   Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as dry
   direct-seeded rice (DSR), zero tillage (ZT) and residue retention may
   hold potential to increase yields, reduce costs and increase farmers'
   profits in RMS. Therefore, replicated 5-year field study was conducted
   to evaluate the effects of six combinations of three tillage and crop
   establishment (TCE) techniques and two residue management options on
   soil physical properties, system productivity and economics of an
   irrigated RMS in north-west India. The TCE techniques consisted of
   transplanted puddled rice (TPR) followed by conventionally tilled maize
   (CTM); CTDSR followed by CTM; and ZTDSR followed by ZTM in main plots
   and two residue management options; removal of residues of both the
   crops (-R) and partial residue (5 t ha(-1)) either retained at soil
   surface on ZT plots or incorporated into the soil in CT plots (+R) for
   both rice and maize in sub-plots. Compared with TPR/CTM-R, soil physical
   parameters such as water-stable aggregates >0.2 mm were 89\% higher, and
   bulk density, penetrometer resistance and infiltration rate showed
   significant (P < 0.05) improvement in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) treatment.
   Similarly, root mass density was 6 to 49\% greater in rice and 21 to
   53\% in maize under ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) plots compared to conventional RMS in
   different soil layers to 60 cm depth. The total amount of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) in 0-30 cm layer increased by 2.86 Mg ha(-1) in ZTDSR/ZTM
   (+R) over conventional practice. Grain yield of TPR was 5-7\% higher
   compared to CTDSR and ZTDSR, which was attributed to increased number of
   grains panicle(-1) and grain weight. Maize yield under ZTDSR/ZTM was
   significantly higher by 4.0\% and 14.2\% compared to CTDSR/CTM and
   TPR/CTM, respectively, due to increase in number of cobs plant(-1) and
   grain number cob(-1). Gradual improvement in soil physical health in
   ZTDSR/ZTM +R system resulted in higher and stable crop productivity
   (17.4-17.6 kg m(-3)) with higher profitability in different years over
   conventional system. Our study demonstrates that CA based management
   practices can be adopted for RMS on sandy loam or similar soils for
   sustaining soil and crop productivity in South Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   monoculture cropping practice. Maximum moisture content at field
   capacity (McFc, 24.9\%), water holding capacity (WHC, 33.3\%) and soil
   organic carbon (OC, 7.16 g kg(-1)) was recorded in P-U-P intercrop

   were increased by 8.15\%, 36.9\%, 8.6\%, 31.5\% and 22\%, respectively
   over Pmono. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable
   micronutrient cations (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) improved by 15.6\%, 23.2\%,

   analysis (PCA) of soil quality attributes was also worked out to
   evaluate the differences induced among intercrop sequencing systems. The

   all intercrop sequencing. Therefore, no correlation was observed between
   the soil properties, and the first, second and third PC (PC1, PC2, and

  abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has contributed substantially to the
   increase in food production, but has come at the expense of soil
   degradation and environmental problems. Management of soil based
   ecosystem services need to be considered in agricultural management
   since intensive management implies not only costs to the farmer but also
   to society. In this study we used data from four long-term (55 years)
   agricultural experiments in southern Sweden to assess the effects of two
   arable farming systems on a range of indicators of soil ecosystem
   services. One farming system used only annual commodity crops (ACC
   system) while the other integrated one year of ley (ley system) into the
   crop rotation. Nitrogen (N) fertiliser was applied annually in both
   farming systems at two rates (0 and 150 kg N ha(-1)). The ley farming
   system had an addition of farmyard manure (FYM) once every fourth year.
   Soil organic carbon, total N, phosphorous, potassium, pH and water
   holding capacity were used as indicators of regulating services;
   bacterial and fungal biomass were used as indicators of supporting
   services; grain yield and protein content were used as indicators of
   provisioning services. We analysed each of the indicators separately, to
   identify effects of the farming systems, using linear mixed effects
   models. In addition, we used principal components analysis to bundle the
   individual indicators together to create latent variables representing
   categories of ecosystem services. Yields of wheat were greatest in the
   plots that received N fertiliser, irrespective of farming system, while
   mycorrhizal fungal biomass was greatest in the ley system with no
   inorganic N fertiliser. The rest of the indicators were similar in both
   farming systems although the lowest values of all ecosystem service
   indicators were found in the ACC system with no N fertiliser. When
   bundling the indicators, no trade-offs were found between regulating,
   supporting and provisioning services. Regulating and supporting services
   were positively correlated, as were regulating and provisioning
   services. The ley system with N fertiliser had significantly greater
   values of regulating and provisioning services relative to the other
   treatments. The results indicate that different farming systems can have
   large effects on ecosystem service flows, and that integrating leys into
   arable rotations can enhance the delivery of soil ecosystem services.

   Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the immediate (one
   year) impacts of pea (Pisum sativum) and turnip (Brassica rapa rapa) as
   cover crops on properties of a Kokomo silty clay loam soil (Fine, mixed,
   superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls) in Central Ohio under on-farm

   four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) after the first season of
   cover cropping and before seeding of soybean (Glycine max) in 2013. Data
   indicate that only few soil parameters were significantly affected by
   the cover crop treatment. For 0-10 cm depth, cover crops significantly
   decreased pH from 6.7 to 5.7 and increased soil organic C (SOC)
   concentrations from 23 to 2.5\% (g 100 g(-1)). Although cover crops did
   not have any significant effects on other soil properties, however,
   there were trends of lower field dry bulk density (BD) and water stable
   aggregates (WSA) in 0-10 cm depth under the cover cropping system (BD:
   13 Mg m(-3), WSA: 72\%) than those of control (BD: 1.5 Mg m(-3), WSA:
   80\% in 0-10 cm), and similar observations were found for deeper soil
   layers. The lack of significant effects on other soil properties may be
   due to high field variability and short duration under cover cropping.
   Similarly, soybean grain yield was not significantly impacted by the
   treatment but yield was slightly higher under cover crop (4.6 Mg ha(-1))
   than under control (4.3 Mg ha(-1)). These data suggest that some
   improvements in soil characteristics are likely even over a short period

   separate assessment of soil fractions in relation to protection against

   clay) and secondary (micro- and macroaggregates) particle size fractions
   on the physical protection of SOC to 30-cm depth of nine agricultural
   and three forest land uses within three contrasting ecoregions of Costa
   Rica (i.e., Isthmian-Atlantic moist, Pacific dry, and Montane forest).
   Specific objectives were to: (1) determine the effect of land use in
   each ecoregion on particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), silt plus
   clay-associated carbon (S+C-C), and micro- and macroaggregate associated
   water-stable aggregate carbon (WSA-C), and (2) establish the
   relationships among aggregate properties and SOC concentration.
   Aggregate stability was characterized by studying the WSA, mean weight
   diameter (MWD), and tensile strength (TS). Soils under coffee (Coffea
   arabica), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and pineapple (Ananas comosus)
   plantations had high clay contents to 30-cm depth (ranging between 42.9
   and 60.7\%), which indicated a high potential for SOC storage. In
   comparison to less disturbed forest soils, micro- and macroaggregation
   was not strongly affected by agricultural land use. At coffee and
   pasture land uses, POM-C concentration was significantly lower (ranging
   between 0.4 and 2.0 g C kg(-1)). Between 58 and 98\% of SOC was
   associated with S+C fractions indicating the importance of these
   particle size fractions to SOC storage. The S+C-C and micro- and
   macroaggregate-C concentrations differed mainly among pineapple, mango
   (Mangifera indica), pasture, and other land uses within ecoregions.
   Further, there was no general tendency of higher C concentrations in the
   macro- vs. the microaggregate fractions in contrast to the aggregate
   hierarchy theory. The MWD was affected by land use only for pineapple
   and organic farming, and it decreased for mango and coffee with increase
   in soil depth. Correlations among SOC, texture, and TS were
   site-specific. Silt content was more important than the other particle
   size fractions in explaining SOC contents. In summary, the amount of
   physically separated soil fractions and their C storage and stability to
   30-cm depth differed mainly among pineapple, mango, pasture, and coffee
   in specific ecoregions. Well-designed long-term field experiments in
   Costa Rica are needed to develop management practices for enhancing SOC
   storage and stabilization in physically separated soil fractions.}},

   increased in the top 30 cm of all soils since 1998 (0.54-0.79 Mg C

   no removal. Near-surface soils (0-5-cm depth) were more sensitive to
   stover removal and showed a 41\% decrease in particulate organic matter

   abundance of water-stable soil aggregates compared with soils with no

   Cumulative infiltration, infiltration rate and aggregate MWD were
   greater with integrated use of FYM along with 100\% NPK compared to
   non-treated control. No significant differences were obtained among
   fertilizer treatments for BD and EC. The SOC pool was the lowest in
   control at 7.3 Mg ha(-1) and increased to 11.6 Mg ha(-1) with
   100\%NPK+FYM. Improved soil physical conditions and increase in SOC
   resulted in higher maize and wheat yields. Infiltration rate, aggregate
   MWD and crop yields were positively correlated with SOC. Continuous
   cropping and integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers
   increased soil C sequestration and crop yields. Balanced application of
   NPK fertilizers with FYM was best option for higher crop yields in
   maize-wheat rotation.}},

   surface layer and reduces the water holding capacity, which is often
   lethal for crops that are sensitive to water stress. In this case study,
   we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex
   (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial
   and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer
   below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which
   the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed
   peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that
   bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden
   pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields
   were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on
   fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more
   samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity
   (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after
   2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC
   between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible,
   however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within
   even a year of reclamation. The results of this study call for active
   measures to reduce organic soil degradation such as reducing tillage and
   on-field traffic or following a crop rotation scheme.}},

   replicates. While increases in soil OM content for the M application
   rates were generally lower, TE and HH treatments including high organic
   carbon (OC) contents resulted in high soil organic matter (OM)
   increases. Organic wastes generally increased the values of soil
   hydraulic properties, with increased aggregate stability (AS) and total
   porosity (F) and reduced bulk density (BD). The highest AS and F values
   were obtained with 6\% HH and 6\% TE applications, respectively. Due to
   different mineralization rates of the organic wastes attributable to
   their carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratios, the same application rate had
   different effects on the soil's hydraulic properties. Manure, having the
   lowest C:N ratio, generally had a lower effect on AS and BD. Increased
   IR due to increases in AS and F by the agricultural waste treatment,
   especially at 4 and 6\% HH, reduced the AW content to 15cm compared with
   2\% HH. This indicates that the significant application of higher C:N
   ratio wastes is not suitable in terms of AW, due to significant
   improvement of IR. While the highest FC (17.3\%) and AWC (10.7\%) values

   station of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh under the aegis of All India
   Co-ordinated Research Project (AICRP) of Integrated Farming Systems
   (IFS) during 2003-10. The four rice crop establishment techniques i.e.,
   direct seeding in zero tilled soil (P-1), wet seeding of sprouted rice
   seed with drum seeder in puddled condition (P-2), manual transplanting
   in puddled soil (P-3) and mechanical transplanting in puddled soil (P-4)
   served as horizontal treatments while four tillage practices in wheat
   (i.e. T-1- rotavator till drill, T-2- conventional sowing, T-3- strip
   till drilling, T-4- Zero till drilling) served as vertical treatments in
   strip plot design with three replications. Total water stable aggregates
   (WSA)(>0.053 mm) in the soil at surface 0-15 cm depth, ranged between
   69.92 and 88.78 \% in rice crop, while in winter crop it varied between
   74.62 and 83.57 \%. According to mean weight diameter (MWD) different
   treatments in regard to crop establishment technique of rice could be
   ranked in the order P-1 > P-4> P-2 > P-3 and T-4 > T-3 > T-1 > T-2 in
   wheat strip regarding tillage practices. However, the MWD decreased
   drastically in lower soil depth. The SOC ranged from 4.06 to 5.67 g
   kg(-1) in soil samples from rice plots and from 4.32 to 5.24 g kg(-1) in
   different tillage treatments in wheat at surface 0-15 cm layer. SOC
   contents in direct seeding in zero tilled rice strip (5.67 g kg(-1)) and
   zero till drill in wheat strip (5.24 g kg(-1)) were significantly higher
   than other treatments in all soil depth. The MBC of direct drilling zero
   tilled (441 mu g g(-1)) in rice strip and zero till drill in wheat strip
   (395 mu g g(-1)) had the highest values while the manually
   transplanted-puddled (383 mu g g(-1)) rice and conventional wheat sowing
   had the lowest values (334 mu g g(-1)) at all the depths. The
   differences were significant in at P<0.01 for both SOC and MBC and
   ranked in order of P-1 > P-2 > P-4 > P-3 of rice crop strip and T-4 >
   T-3 > T-1 > T-2 in wheat crop strip under 0-15 cm soil depth. The
   decrease in SOC an average all treatments was about 51 and 89 percent
   from layer 0-15 to 15-30 and 30-45 cm, respectively. The interaction

   water entry (WE); (2) facilitate water movement and availability (WMA);
   (3) resist degradation (RD); and (4) supply nutrients for plant growth
   (PNS) were estimated for each land use. The result revealed that AF
   affected all soil quality functions positively more than the other land
   uses. Furthermore, the four soil quality functions were integrated into
   an overall SQI; and the values for the three land uses were in the
   order: 0.58 (AF) > 0.51 (IR) > 0.47 (RF). The dominant soil properties

   water stable aggregation (20.0\%); total porosity (16.0\%); total

  abstract = {{The conventional model of aggregate formation suggests a hierarchy where
   micro-aggregates with lower porosity and therefore reduced soil organic
   carbon (SOC) mineralization form inside macro-aggregates. This model has
   however been questioned for highly weathered Oxisols where inconclusive
   results regarding the presence of aggregate hierarchy have been obtained
   to date. We hypothesized that in Oxisols (i) an aggregate hierarchy
   would be present (ii) the porosity of micro-aggregates would be lower
   than that of macro-aggregates and (iii) pore geometry of aggregates
   would influence SOC mineralization. We collected topsoils from Oxisols
   in northern New South Wales, Australia from which macro-aggregates (>250
   mu m), micro-aggregates (53-250 mu m) and <53 mu m fractions were
   isolated from bulk soil by wet sieving. 3D images of macro- and
   micro-aggregates were produced using X-ray computed tomography (mu CT)
   showing the presence of micro-aggregates inside macro-aggregates, which
   confirmed the presence of an aggregate hierarchy in the Oxisols studied.
   Macro-aggregates were more common and SOC in higher concentrations in
   forest systems compared with agricultural (the cultivation or pasture)
   land-uses, but aggregate geometry differed little between the land-uses
   studied. The porosity of macroaggregates (4\%) was significantly lower
   than micro-aggregates (5.5\%). Despite the differences in pore geometry
   between macro- and micro-aggregates, SOC mineralized (SOCmin) during a
   2-month incubation (at 25 degrees C) was similar in macro- (3\% of SOC
   concentration) and micro-aggregates (2.8\% of SOC concentration). We
   conclude that although aggregate hierarchy exists in these soils and
   that aggregate geometry did differ between aggregate size classes, there
   was no evidence to support the porosity exclusion principle and the
   assumption that SOC is preferentially stabilized within microaggregates

   organic matter (SOM) concentrations as a result of rapid organic matter
   turnover rates in the warm, moist climate. Orchard management practices
   that can improve SOM may also improve other soil quality-related
   variables for sustained production, which is an explicit goal for the
   National Organic Program (NOP). Therefore, beginning in Mar. 2006 and
   continuing for seven seasons, annual applications of municipal green
   compost, shredded office paper, wood chips, and mow-blow grass mulch
   groundcover management systems (GMS) in combination with composted
   poultry litter, commercial organic fertilizer, or a non-fertilized
   control as a nutrient source were implemented to evaluate their ability
   to alter near-surface soil quality in a newly established, organically
   managed apple orchard in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest
   Arkansas. The SOM concentration in the top 10 cm averaged 1.5\% across
   all treatments at orchard establishment in 2006, but by 2012, SOM
   concentration had increased in all GMS and more than doubled to 5.6\%
   under green compost. Similarly, soil bulk density in the top 6 cm, which
   averaged 1.34 g.cm(-3) among treatment combinations in 2006, decreased
   in all GMS by 2012. Either green compost or shredded paper had the
   largest concentration of total water-stable aggregates across all

   various organic GMS had numerically greater values compared with an
   adjacent conventionally managed orchard on the same soils.
   Implementation of these GMS appears to provide apple producers in the
   Ozark Highlands and similar regions a tangible means of meeting NOP
   requirements for improving soil quality concurrent with production of
   certified organic crops. The findings also have implications for

   and soil nutrients (total nitrogen, TN; organic carbon, OC; cation
   exchange capacity, CEC; potassium, K) were significantly deteriorated by
   the application of T1 for consecutive two-years. The Paired-Samples
   T-Test showed significant improvements in these soil parameters due to

   study was carried out to investigate the effects of cover crops in
   organic no-till vegetables systems on changes in soil organic matter and
   CO2-C emissions, in dry and rainy seasons. We hypothesized that CO2-C
   emissions are higher in conventional till as compared with no-till, and
   that no-till increases soil C sink. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year
   cropping sequence involving two crops per year-cabbage (Brassica
   oleracea L.) in winter and eggplant (Solanum melongena L) in summer
   time. Treatments were no-till on dead mulch of grass (Avena strigosa
   Schreb. and Zea mays L.), leguminous (Lupinus albus L and Crotalaria
   juncea L.), intercrop (grass and leguminous) and conventional till (no
   dead mulch) with rotary hoe arranged in a randomized block design on a
   clayey Oxisol (Typic Haplustox) at Domingos Martins-ES, Brazil. On 2012
   and 2013, disturbed soil samples at three different layers (0-5,5-15 and
   15-30 cm) and undisturbed samples at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm, for
   chemical and organic matter characterization were taken. CO2-C emissions
   and soil temperature were measured in situ on March, May, August and
   October 2012 and February 2013 (after 3 years of experiment).
   Conventional till site showed the lowest microporosity values and the
   highest macroporosity, followed by lower soil bulk density at 0-10 cm
   layer. Total organic C ranged from 34.94 to 50.48 g kg(-1) in intercrop
   and 27.11 to 43.74 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Total N ranged from
   2.81 to 5.34 g kg(-1) in grass and 2.54 to 4.51 g kg(-1) in conventional
   till. Highest C stock was recorded in intercrop. Conventional till
   showed lower labile C values while recalcitrant C was higher in the
   intercrop treatment. The annual average of CO2-C emissions (mu mol CO2
   m(-2) s(-1)) followed the order: grass (15.89) > intercrop (13.77) >
   leguminous (13.09) > conventional till (11.20). Highest annual average
   of soil temperature was recorded in conventional till (23.95 degrees C).
   Lowest annual mean of soil water content, microbial biomass C, and
   highest metabolic quotient were recorded in conventional till. These
   results suggest that the use of cover crops and organic compost in
   pre-planting promote C increments. The contribution of organic residues
   increases the water holding capacity and reduces soil temperature.
   No-till reduces soil disturbance and promotes a positive balance of C.
   Organic no-till vegetable systems is a strategy to increase soil C and

   site-specific management zones (MZs) and (ii) to evaluate the
   variable-rate applications of manure using risk-assessment tools of
   nitrogen (N) leaching and phosphorus (P) runoff indices to understand
   its impact on environmental quality. This study was conducted in
   northeastern Colorado on continuous and furrow-irrigated maize fields.
   Experimental strips, 4.5 m wide and 540 m long, spanned across all MZs
   with treatments nested within MZs in the field. Variable rates of dairy
   and beef feedlot manure applied on irrigated and dryland fields
   respectively ranged from 0 to 67 Mg ha(-1). Surface soil quality
   parameters evaluated before and after this study included bulk density,
   organic matter, water-holding capacity, electrical conductivity, and
   particle-size analysis. Results indicate that animal manure applications
   of 44 and 67 Mg ha(-1) significantly (P <= 0.05) increased soil organic
   matter and decreased bulk density of low- and medium-productivity-level
   MZs and had no significant impact on surface soil organic matter and
   bulk density of the high-productivity-level MZs. Animal manure
   significantly (P <= 0.05) increased surface soil water-holding capacity
   and soil electrical conductivity across zones; however, the maximum
   manure-induced soil EC was 1.0 dS m(-1), which was below levels regarded
   as potentially harmful for maize production. Soil texture was not
   affected by animal manure applications. Colorado N leaching and P index
   indicated no environmental hazard associated with variable rate

   12\% on average. Agricultural use resulted in soil compaction, although
   not critical, at the expense of a decrease of macropores, while
   differences between GP and PP were influenced by soil type. Regarding
   the type of soil, Argiudolls (silty soils), were more vulnerable to
   agricultural intensification, which increased degradation processes by
   compaction. The TOC and structural stability index (SSI) were the only
   variables where values lower than optimal in agricultural treatment were

   Secondly, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of
   polyacrylamide (PAM), straw mulch (SM), and paper pellet (PP) on
   infiltration rate (IR), aggregate stability (AS) and water-holding
   capacity (WHC) of soil. Treatments were the application of PAM with
   irrigation water (10 mg.L-1), SM (1.25 and 2.5 kg.m(-2)), and waste PP
   (1.25 and 2.5 kg.m(-2)) mulching. The study results indicated that each
   treatment had particular effects on IR. PAM application had little
   effect on infiltration, and it was more effective on AS, when compared
   to other conditioners. SM and PP applications increased AS depending on
   the increase of organic matter content in the soil. PAM application at
   given concentrations had no significant effects on water-holding
   capacity. However, it can be inferred that other mulching applications
   had positive effects on field capacity and, thereby, on available water
   content depending on the mulching rate. It is well-known that the effect
   of PAM is observed especially during irrigation, and this is not
   permanent for soil amendment but has an instant effect for many
   conditions. However, using SM and PP is more appropriate, because of
   their low costs, more persistent effects, and opportunity to re-use

   Calcisol-Solonetz complexes in the dry steppe zone of Russia. The sites
   were comparable in terms of climate, soil texture and land-use history,
   but differed in the duration of agricultural abandonment, covering 1, 7,
   12, 17 and 42 years of self-restoration. During self-restoration without
   direct human impact, the vegetation developed towards a steppe with
   dominance of Artemisia lercheana/pauciflora and Stipa pennata. After 17
   years, the abundance of Artemisia pauciflora indicated again the
   Solonetz locations within the Calcisol-Solonetz complex, which were not
   visible during arable land use. Pedogenesis resulted in the recovery of
   the natural soil structure-fine subangular polyhedral for Calcisol and
   crumble fine platy for Solonetz. The recovery of soil structure of
   Solonetz was in accordance with a decline of water-stable aggregates
   from 84\% to 68\%. The plow features were still well visible after 42
   years of self-restoration in both soil groups. Partial integration of
   Btn materials into the plow layer induced a pH increase during
   cultivation of the Solonetzes, while slight pH decreases were observed
   during self-restoration afterwards. Other chemical properties of both
   soil groups remained unchanged. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed an
   exchange sodium percentage (ESP) below 5.0\% and an electrical
   conductivity (ECe) below 50 mS m(-1) at the topsoil during the period of
   self-restoration. The development towards natural soils was observed in
   terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. SOC stocks of the Calcisols
   increased slowly from 2.0 to 3.5 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-0.5 m,
   comprising 64\% of the natural soil. SOC stocks of the Solonetzes grew
   from 1.7 to 3.1 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-05 m and almost reached the
   level of natural soil already after 12 years of self-restoration. The
   long-term modelling showed a recovery of SOC stocks almost after 100
   years for the Calcisol and the Solonetz chronosequences. The nutrient
   dynamics traced SOC dynamics during the self-restoration. The
   investigation of different carbon pools showed a significant organic
   carbon (OC) enrichment of the density fractions <1.8 g cm(-3) (free
   particulate organic material (POM) and occluded POM) and the density
   fractions >1.8 g cm(-3) (sand coarse/medium silt, fine silt, clay)
   following an increase of total SOC during self-restoration. In the
   Calcisol chronosequence, the dynamics of all fractions was close to the
   dynamics of total SOC with the exception of free POM showing a moderate
   accumulation rate in relation to total SOC. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes
   showed a more intensive accumulation of free POM and a slower OC
   sequestration in aggregates compared to total SOC. Both chronosequences
   showed comparable recovery rates for the passive SOC pool and total SOC.
   Despite all these alterations the study showed no full restoration for
   many parameters within the chronosequential time scale of 42 years. (C)

   farms with surface residue cover (< 30 \%). Analyses of variance
   (ANOVA), correlation analyses, stepwise regression, and the principal

   porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were

  abstract = {{The formation and stabilization of soil aggregates have a key role to
   play in adequate soil functioning. Aggregate stability (AS) is
   considered by some authors to be a property that provides information on
   soil quality. It's also a property that is highly influenced by land use
   and management. This study aims to identify the long-term changes in
   soil aggregation and related properties comparing forest and
   agricultural land use in Mediterranean calcareous soils. For the
   research, seven study sites with different soil characteristics located
   in Alicante Province (E Spain) were chosen to compare the overall effect
   of land use change from agriculture to forestry on soil aggregation. At
   every site, samples of the same soil type were collected from
   agricultural land (dry crops with conventional tillage management using
   ploughing), and nearby forest, where agriculture was abandoned between
   20 and 50 years ago. Selected physical and chemical properties like:
   texture, total content of aggregates (TCA), aggregate stability (AS),
   organic matter content (OM), carbonates, mean weight diameter (MWD) of
   aggregates and water repellency (WR) were analysed on the collected soil
   samples.
   As expected, in all soils, the AS was significantly lower in
   agricultural sites than in forest sites. But in some cases the
   differences were much higher than in others. In forest sites the AS
   varied between 46 and 82\% while in agricultural sites it ranged between
   14 and 45\%. The results showed strong positive correlation of AS with
   OM. The lowest values of AS in forest areas were found in wettable sandy
   soils. The relative increase of AS in forest soils compared to
   agricultural land use ranged from 39 to 79\%. These differences can be
   explained mainly by some soil properties, such as OM content, texture,
   and WR. In particular, the lower OM content and absence of WR are
   responsible for the lower values of AS in agricultural land use due to
   the long-term conventional tillage management. Soil WR was found in
   three of the sites, and its presence plays a key role in soil
   aggregation and its stability, especially for sandy soils. The MWD was
   in most cases higher in forest than in agricultural sites, except for
   two wettable sandy soils with the lowest initial AS. In the case of
   carbonates, no correlations were found with AS, and only in the group of
   sandy soils, significant positive correlations between carbonates and
   TCA and with MWD were found.
   In conclusion we can say that the prolonged use of conventional tillage
   management using ploughing has a strong influence on AS in all types of
   soils studied in this research. The recovery after decades of land use
   abandonment not only is dependent on how is the increase of soil OM
   content, but also is controlled by some soil properties such as the

   particularly in semi-arid regions where soil productivity is usually low
   and lowering soil quality can severely decrease crops yields. This study
   was done in an area of 900 km(2) in the semi-arid agricultural region of
   Hashtroud in northwestern Iran to determine the relationship between
   soil productivity and soil erodibility. Wheat grain yield (WGY) and soil
   erodibility factor (K) were measured separately at 108 plots in 36
   dry-farming lands under natural rainfall conditions for a two-year
   period from March 2005 to March 2007. Based on the results, significant
   differences were observed among the lands in WGY (P < 0.001) and K (P <
   0.001). These differences were attributed to variations of soil
   properties among the lands. There was a negative relationship between
   WGY and K (R-2 = 0.77). Multiple regression analysis indicated that both
   WGY and K were significantly related to aggregate stability and
   infiltration rate, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 and
   0.90, respectively. Organic matter and calcium carbonate equivalent were
   the most effective soil properties that enhanced both aggregate
   stability and infiltration rate. The study revealed that soils with a
   lower percentage of water-stable aggregates and a lower infiltration
   rate also tended to have a higher susceptibility to erosion and a lower

   macroinvertebrate communities, which are recognized as major drivers of
   soil functions (Lavelle et aL, 2006). To explore these relations, we
   tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to
   landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are
   linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators
   of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of
   Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon
   where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land
   use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At
   each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic
   units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and
   aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration,
   drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution;
   soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation
   was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data
   (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0.30, p < 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between
   macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia
   analysis: RV= 0.35, p<0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in
   pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and
   diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m
   (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was
   significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0.42, p<0.01), as
   was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) =0.43, p
   <0.01), Isoptera (r(2) =0.30, p<0.01), Diplopoda (r(2) =0.31, p <0.01),

   was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) =0.38,
   p<0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r(2)<0.10).
   Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil
   macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is
   significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia,

   security and sustainable agricultural development in China. Accurate
   estimates of the distribution of soil C and N stores and their
   relationship to crop yield are crucial to developing appropriate

   variation of soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TSN), and associated
   variables in the surface layer (0-40 cm) of soils from intensive
   agricultural systems in 19 counties within Henan Province, China, and
   compared these patterns with crop yield. Mean soil C and N
   concentrations were 14.9 g kg(-1) and 1.37 g kg(-1), respectively,
   whereas soil C and N stores were 4.1 kg m(-2) and 0.4 kg m(-2),

   positively related to SOC, TSN, soil C and N store, and soil C and N
   stock. Soil C and N were positively correlated with soil bulk density
   but negatively correlated with soil porosity. These results indicate
   that variations in soil C could regulate crop yield in intensive
   agricultural systems, and that spatial patterns of C and N levels in
   soils may be regulated by both climatic factors and agro-ecosystem

   carbon (SOC) and nutrient content improved under residue management. RB
   with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) resulted in the maximum SOC
   stock, and it was 2.0 Mg/ha and 2.7 Mg/ha higher than that of the

   negatively impacted by conventional tillage (CT). The TWSA
   concentrations were 19\% greater (P < 0.05) under CT than no-tillage
   (NT) within the dryland low-fertility-residue treatment combination.
   High-fertility-residue resulted in 18\% less (P < 0.05) TWSA than under
   low-fertility-residue within the irrigated-NT treatment combination.
   Under high-fertility-residue, TWSA concentrations were 13\% less (P <

   agricultural management system is essential for sustainability of the
   system. The long-term (15 years) impact of zero tillage in wheat under
   rice-wheat cropping system in semi-arid region of Indo-Gangetic Plains
   (IGP) was evaluated for physical properties, organic carbon build up,
   root growth and wheat productivity in different textured soils. The
   conventional (CT, two harrowing, one cultivator and planking) and zero
   tillage (ZT, direct drilling) systems were investigated.
   ZT increased soil organic carbon significantly to a depth of 0.10, 0.15
   and 0.25 m in sandy loam, loam and clay loam soil, respectively,
   indicating its buildup to deeper depths with increase in fineness of
   soil texture. Carbon stock in surface 0.4 m soil depth increased by
   19.0, 34.7 and 38.8\% over CT in 15 years in sandy loam, loam and clay
   loam soil, respectively. The corresponding carbon sequestration rates
   were 0.24, 0.46 and 0.62 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). It reduced the plough pan,
   however, a significant increase in bulk density was observed in surface
   0.05 m in sandy loam and 0.10 m in both loam and clay loam soils. Water
   dispersible silt + clay reduced indicating better soil aggregation.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivity increased significantly only to a depth
   of 0.10 m but with varying magnitudes. Increase in magnitude in surface
   0.05 m layer was highest in loam (51\%) followed by sandy loam (40\%)
   and clay loam (38\%) soil. Although ZT increased water retention and
   aeration porosity but increase in field water capacity was significant
   to a deeper depth (0.15 m) in clay loam soil. Water intake rate also
   increased significantly in clay loam soil (28\%) over CT. The root
   biomass increased significantly and the highest increase was recorded in
   loam (81\%) followed by sandy loam (70\%) and clay loam (42\%) soil. In
   addition, if encouraged roots to penetration deeper in the soils.
   In spite of improved soil physical properties and root growth under ZT,
   the significant increase in mass of grains and consequently the wheat
   yield, was observed only in clay loam soil indicating that the physical
   properties of other soils under CT have not reached to a stage limiting
   plant growth and yields. Study concludes that the ZT practice in wheat
   under rice-wheat system of semi-arid region of IGP in Haryana may be
   adopted for sustaining productivity of the system but the implementation
   of the practice must be promoted in fine textured soils. (C) 2014

   2001-2002) under semiarid rainfed conditions in western India on a very
   deep, sandy loam soil. Green gram(1) (Vigna radiata)-mustard (Brassica

   pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping systems were tested for the
   first four years (first phase of the experiment). Cowpea (Vigna

   (second phase of the experiment). Runoff, soil losses, sediment
   concentrations, crop yields, soil organic carbon, bulk density and water
   stable aggregates were observed for all the treatment combinations. RFT
   and SMFT were both effective in reducing runoff and soil loss. RFT, NT
   and SMFT reduced runoff by 69.4, 16.2 and 59.6\% respectively compared
   with CT. Average soil loss in NT was 37.2\% less than CT. Average
   sediment concentration of runoff during June-July was greater than in

   consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed
   using indicators, e.g. microbial biomass as an indicator of supporting
   services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of
   soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has
   been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance
   soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil
   services - organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and
   available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net
   nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and
   retention) - in barley fields, leys and permanent pastures along a
   landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000 m radii). In
   addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against
   these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of
   most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were
   consistently lower than in permanent pastures. Leys supported greater
   microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no
   effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However,
   landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH,
   suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and
   therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing
   barley yield and the soil indicators. The results suggest that soil ES
   are determined at the field level, with little influence from the
   surrounding landscape, and that greater crop yields do not necessarily
   come at the expense of supporting soil services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {{Labile pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) are affecting
   the carbon (C) and N fluxes in the terrestrial soils, whereas long-term
   C and N storage is determined by the long-lived recalcitrant fractions.
   Tillage and subsurface drainage influences these pools; however, the
   effect of these systems on poorly drained soils may be different.
   Therefore, the present study was conducted on a field experiment,
   established at the Waterman Farm of the Ohio State University in 1994.
   Specific objectives of the study are to assess the influence of
   no-tillage (NT), chisel tillage (CT) with drainage (TD) and non-drainage
   (ND) management under a continuous corn (Zea mays L.) system on SOC, C
   fractions (heavy and light), and water stable aggregates (WSA). Data
   from this study showed that the SOC stock for the NT was 25, 37 and 32\%
   higher for the 0-10, 10-20 and 40-60cm depths, respectively, as compared
   to that under CT system. Tillage significantly influenced the light
   fraction (LF) and heavy fraction (HF) of carbon. The NT system increased
   LF and HF by 10 and 12\%, respectively, compared to CT for the 0-10cm
   depth. Eighteen years of NT management decreased soil bulk density and
   improved macroaggregates and mean weight diameter compared to that under
   CT system. Drainage impacts on soil parameters were negligible, and may
   be partially due to the reason that the corn-corn cropping system may
   not have sufficiently improved the soil properties between the two
   tillage systems. In general, drainage improved porosity and the corn
   yield. It can be concluded that NT with subsurface management improves
   SOC dynamics and promotes aggregation and corn yield as compared to that

   to the occurrence of platy and massive structures. In this study, we
   aimed to identify the soil management practices that promote platy
   structure formation, and explain the soil physical behaviour linked to
   the thickness of platy structures in relation to infiltration rate, bulk
   density and shear strength. Six fields with different numbers of years
   under agriculture and diverse previous crops (maize or wheat-soybean
   double crop) were sampled, distinguishing within each field headlands
   (areas with higher traffic) and centre (lower traffic). Twenty samples
   were taken at random along a 200-m transect to characterise soil
   structure (platy, granular or massive) and the thickness of the platy
   structure. Principal component analysis revealed linkages between
   previous crop and location in each field and type of structure. ANOVA
   showed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction of previous crop x location.
   The frequency and thickness of the platy structures were lower, and
   those of granular structures higher, under wheat-soybean double cropping
   and in the centre of the field. Greater thickness of the platy structure
   determined lower water infiltration rate (r = -0.337; P < 0.01) and
   greater soil shear strength (r = 0.297, P < 0.01). Micromorphological
   analysis indicated the dominance of massive and platy structure in the

   much attention, together with the constraints placed on crop growth by
   naturally occurring subsoil salt stocks. These factors have not been
   quantified in the drier (450-550mm), marginal cropping areas to the
   west. With widespread adoption of zero tillage technology and the
   potential for large increases in the capture and storage of rainfall in
   good seasons, mobilisation of salt could be exacerbated should crop
   water use be constrained by salt toxicity and/or nutrient deficiency. We
   investigated the size of salt stocks, historic deep drainage, and
   nutrient depletion under continuous cropping in the Grey and Brown
   Vertosols of the Walgett and Coonamble districts of north-western NSW.
   Soils collected from seven paired sites (cropped v. control native
   vegetation) showed chloride concentrations >500mg/kg within 0-1.2m, high
   exchangeable sodium percentage (similar to 30\%) at depth and deficiency
   in phosphorus, manganese and zinc. Soil total nitrogen decreased from an
   average stock of 4.9t/ha at a rate of 0.008t/ha.year under cropping
   within 0-0.1m and soil carbon stocks decreased from 39t/ha by
   0.20t/ha.year within 0-0.5m.. Despite low rainfall, high evaporation and
   the large water-holding capacity of the cracking clays, there were
   significant downward shifts in chloride concentrations under cropping.
   Estimates of deep drainage under continuous cropping using chloride mass
   balance, chloride-front displacement and crop water-balance modelling
   with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) generally
   agreed (range 0.1-2\% of average annual rainfall). Simulations suggested
   that deep drainage may be increased 5-10-fold under zero-tillage winter
   cropping due to enhanced capture of rainfall by zero tillage compared
   with traditional practices. The associated flushing of salt from the
   root-zone together with correction of nutrient deficiency would enhance
   crop water use and productivity. Current methods indicate little storage
   in the subsoil for future deep drainage and that hydraulic conductivity
   is very low. Hence, the long-term effects of any increase in drainage
   rates, due to changes in cropping practices and/or climate, on the
   potential for salinisation of groundwater or transient water logging of
   the surface, are equivocal.}},

  abstract = {{Intensive agriculture in South Asia has resulted in soil degradation and
   loss of crop production potential. Soil health is a key factor in crop
   production and the new emphasis on sustainable agriculture has generated
   interest in the optimization of all aspects of soil functioning -
   physical, chemical and biological. The objective of this study was to
   use a set of soil health indicators to measure the effects of farm
   manure (FM) application and cropping pattern on Pakistan soils. For this
   study five cropping systems, i.e. cotton-wheat (CW), maize-wheat (MW),
   rice-wheat (RW), sugarcane-wheat (SW) and vegetable-vegetable (V-V),
   both, manured and non-manured were selected from each cropping zones of
   Pakistan. Samples collected were analyzed for soil health indicators
   including soil bulk density, available water capacity (AWC), aggregate
   stability (WSA), macro porosity, organic matter (OM), soil active carbon
   (ActC), potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), P, K, Zn, Ca, S, CEC
   and pH. Manured plots had significantly higher levels of OM (28\%), ActC
   (43\%), PMN (92\%), AWC (24\%), and macro porosity (19\%) and
   significantly lower bulk density (5\%) than non-manured plots. Among
   cropping systems highest values were found in SW, MW and SW compared to
   RW, with higher values in the former systems for WSA (243\%), AWC (16\%)
   and macro-porosity (39\%). This clearly gave indication of the
   deteriorative effect of puddling in rice cultivation. Higher values were
   observed in MW, RW, CW with higher OM (36\%), active carbon (ActC,
   33.6\%) and PMN (731\%) compared to CW and VV. Only S and Mg were
   significantly higher in manured plots while pH, CEC, NO3-N, P, K, Zn and
   Ca were statistically not different in manured fields. Results of this
   study conclude that long-term manure applications improve soil quality,
   while puddling, especially in rice cultivation, exhibits maximum damage
   to soil physical quality indicators. (C) 2014 Friends Science Publishers}},

   crops is recommended to improve soil quality and sustain agricultural
   production. The effects on soil properties of three tillage systems (as
   main plot) including direct drilling (D), harrowing to a depth of 8 to
   10 cm (H), and moldboard plowing (MP) with and without a cover crop were
   evaluated in a long-term experiment on a sandy loam soil in Denmark.
   Chemical, physical, and biological soil properties were measured in the
   spring of 2012. The field measurements included mean weight diameter
   (MWD) after the drop-shatter test, penetration resistance, and visual
   evaluation of soil structure (VESS). In the laboratory, aggregate
   strength, water-stable aggregates (WSA), and clay dispersibility were
   measured. The analyzed chemical and biological properties included soil
   organic C (SOC), total N, microbial biomass C, labile P and K, and pH.
   Reduced tillage (D and H) resulted in a stratification of the chemical
   properties within the 0- to 20-cm topsoil layer but a uniform
   distribution for MP. There was an accumulation of SOC, total N, and
   labile P and K and reduced pH in the 0- to 10-cm layer. Reduced tillage
   increased soil strength in terms of greater MWD, VESS, WSA, aggregate
   tensile strength, and rupture energy. Five years of using a cover crop
   alleviated plow pan compaction at the 20- to 40-cm depth by reducing
   penetration resistance. A significant interaction between tillage and
   cover crop treatments indicated the potential benefit of using a
   combination of cover crops and direct drilling to produce a better soil
   friability. The usefulness of the VESS method for soil structural
   evaluation was supported by the high positive correlation of MWD with
   VESS scores.}},

   landscapes. Understanding the ecological impacts of agricultural
   legacies, which may last for decades to millennia following agricultural
   abandonment, is critical for interpreting contemporary patterns of
   biodiversity and for informing strategies for the restoration of
   post-agricultural ecosystems. However, the study of agricultural
   legacies is complicated by non-random land-use decisions: areas selected
   for agriculture commonly differ from non-agricultural areas in ways that
   may confound interpretation of agricultural legacies (e.g., agricultural
   areas may have more productive soils). We evaluated legacies of tillage
   agriculture in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands of the
   Southeastern United States, using a paired-plot study design (n = 29
   paired remnant and post-agricultural woodlands) to minimize the
   confounding influence of non-random past land-use decisions.
   Agricultural legacies were prevalent, but not due to differences in the
   types of sites selected for agriculture. Nearly 60 years after
   agricultural abandonment and afforestation, numerous soil attributes
   (i.e., N, P, organic matter, soil water holding capacity) remain altered
   in post-agricultural woodlands, relative to adjacent remnants. Overstory
   tree abundance and understory plant species richness were similar in
   remnant and post-agricultural woodlands, but we found a pronounced
   agricultural legacy on over- and understory plant community composition.
   Understory compositional differences were striking, particularly given
   the proximity of post-agricultural woodlands to immediately adjacent
   remnant source populations and the time (>50 years) for source
   populations to spread. This difference in understory community
   composition could be caused by the persistent environmental differences
   we observed or by dispersal limitation, as evidenced by greater species
   richness in post-agricultural sites with greater historical landscape
   connectivity. We suggest that future experimental work will further
   assist in a mechanistic understanding of how agricultural legacies
   impede understory plant recovery and that this understanding will
   benefit the formulation of strategies for the restoration of
   post-agricultural longleaf pine woodlands and other forested systems.

   N-fertilization (0 or 90 kg/ha N) practices on soil porosity and active
   bacterial communities in cropping system plots (sunflower wheat or maize

   (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis, RT-PCR-DGGE) exploiting the 16S rRNA of bacteria and
   nirK, nirS and nosZ transcripts of denitrifiers. Finally, canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to correlate microbial data with
   soil physical and chemical characteristics.
   When repeated for a long period, no-tillage has significantly increased
   soil compaction compared to the conventional tilled soil. Soil
   compaction was likely responsible for creating a selective environment
   for active bacterial species. On the other hand, tillage favoured the
   richness and diversity of active soil bacteria by increasing the rate of
   diffusion of 02 and the energy sources availability. A wide variability
   of active nirK denitrifiers was found in each soil management, while
   nirS denitrifiers were more closely related to lower porosity
   conditions. N fertilizer management seemed to affect mainly the active

   Fields with the longest time since disturbance (15 and 20 years) have a

   bacterial and fungal composition. Total N, NH4+, C and organic matter

   but a decrease of microbial biomass C, macroaggregate (250-2000 mu m) C
   and free light fraction organic matter indicate a loss of important
   fractions of soil organic C. More C was found in macroaggregates under
   rye-grass than under maize one year after re-conversion in loamy soils.

   grass (Brachiaria decumbens). Soil samples were collected from three
   slope positions: top, middle, and bottom. For physical properties and
   root studies, in each position soil was collected at three different
   points and in four depths (0.0-2.5, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-10.0, and 10.0-20.0

   clay content. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized
   design with repeated measures in space. The results showed better
   aggregation, density, and porosity in the area of native secondary
   forest. The replacement of pasture by sabia lead to a decrease in the
   aggregation but did not affect bulk density or soil's total porosity.
   Nutrient levels were higher in the sabia area, although statistically
   different just for K and saturation of exchangeable bases. Changes in

   selected soil properties on clay (Chromic luvisol) and loamy sand
   (Ferric acrisol) soils in central Zimbabwe. Soil samples were collected

   and microbial biomass C and N at 0-5, 6-10 and 11-20 cm depths. Results
   showed that clearing and conversion of miombo woodlands to croplands
   reduced soil nutrients, cation exchange capacity (range: 9.6-21.0
   cmol(c) kg(-1) in clay; 7.0-15.5 cmol(c) kg(-1) in loamy sand), and
   microbial C (range: 0.06-0.54\% in clay; 0.02-0.37\% in loamy sand). The
   extent and nature of change was variable, depending on the soil type and
   depth. Clearing of trees and leaving soil surface covered with grass did
   not always translate to a significant decline in soil organic C after
   four seasons (range: 0.69-2.24\% in clay; 0.24-1.43\% in loamy sand),
   unless the clearing was followed by successive cultivation and cropping
   without N fertilization. The reduced soil quality under cultivation was
   attributed to a potential pulse in decomposition and mineralization
   processes caused by soil disturbance, followed by leaching of released
   nutrients to lower horizons. This could be aided by nutrient removal in
   crop parts during harvest, without adequate soil nutrient replenishment.
   Under the woodland ecosystem, litter-fall may help to maintain
   steady-state infiltration rate (range: 45-126 cm h(-1) in clay; 32-97 cm
   h(-1) in loamy sand) by protecting the soil surface from damage and
   ensuring the formation of stable aggregates which preserve pore

   sequestration after nine year's rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L) cropping under an ongoing experiment at Punjab Agricultural
   University, Ludhiana, Punjab (India). This study was based on five
   treatments (100\%N, 100\%NP, 100\%NPK, 100\%NPK + FYM and the control).
   In the surface soil layer (0-15 cm), soil organic carbon (SOC) increased
   from the initial status of 2.42 to 3.26 g kg(-1) in the control, which
   significantly increased with the application of 100\%NPK (4.11 g kg(-1))
   and 100\%NPK + FYM (4.55 g kg(-1)). The rice-wheat cropping even without
   any fertilization (control) contributed toward carbon sequestration
   (1.94 Mg C ha(-1)) with soil organic carbon pools and carbon
   sequestration rate of 7.84 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1),
   respectively. The soil organic carbon pools, carbon sequestration and
   rate of carbon sequestration as observed in treatment of balanced
   fertilization (100\%NPK) were significantly increased from 9.19 to 9.99
   Mg C ha(-1), 3.30 to 4.10 Mg C ha(-1) and 037 to 0.46 Mg C ha(-1)
   yr(-1), respectively when farmyard manure was applied in conjunction
   with 100\%NPK. The application of 100\%NPK and 100\%NPK + FYM
   significantly increased the soil labile carbon (1378 and 1578 mg kg(-1),
   respectively), water soluble carbon (35.3 and 37.2 mg kg, respectively)
   and water soluble carbohydrates (526 and 538 mg kg(-1), respectively) as
   compared to the control, where the corresponding values were 898, 16.8
   and 464 mg kg(-1). The content of water stable aggregates organic carbon
   also increased with fertilization especially in combination with
   farmyard manure, whereas bulk density of soil was significantly reduced
   in the treatment of 100\%NPK (1.49 Mg m(-3)) and 100\%NPK + FYM (1.46 Mg
   m(-3)) over the control (1.60 Mg m(-3)). The fertilizer treatments
   (100\%N, 100\%NP and 100\%NPK) made a positive influence on soil organic
   carbon content in subsurface layers (15-60 cm) also and it was more so
   in the treatment of 100\%NPK + FYM as compared to the control, although
   contents did not differ significantly. Balanced fertilization (100\%NPK)
   with and without FYM significantly improved the labile C content of soil
   (up to depth of 60 cm) over the control. Balanced fertilization in
   combination with FYM significantly increased the water soluble carbon
   content of soil in comparison to the control (up to depth of 60 cm).
   Bulk density of sub surface soil (15-60 cm) was reduced in all the
   treatments as compared to the control although the treatment effect was
   nonsignificant. The rice-wheat cropping sequence thus, showed the
   potential of mitigating atmospheric carbon load through its
   sequestration and integrated nutrient management may further enhance
   this potential. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has been vital for meeting global food
   demand but has caused environmental degradation. This has disrupted the
   ability of soil to provide vital ecosystem services. Organic farming is
   often thought to conserve and utilise soil ecosystem services, and thus
   be a more sustainable method of food production than conventional
   farming. However, evidence for this is equivocal, and little is known of
   the potential trade-offs between soil functions, which can be classified
   as supporting and provisioning ecosystem services, in conventional and
   organic systems. In addition, few studies have simultaneously examined
   how surrounding landscape heterogeneity affects soil functions in
   agriculture. In this study we investigated the effects of farming method
   (conventional versus organic) and landscape heterogeneity (100 m, 500 m
   and 1000 m radius) on indicators of soil ecosystem services: soil
   organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water holding capacity (WHC)
   and plant-available phosphorous (P) (measures of carbon storage and
   nutrient retention); net N mineralisation and microbial community
   composition and biomass (nutrient cycling); and crop yield. We found no
   effect of landscape heterogeneity, and no differences in any of the
   measured soil and microbial variables between conventional and organic
   farms, apart from net N mineralisation, which was higher in organic
   farms. However, conventional farms had significantly greater yield than
   organic farms, and there was no apparent trade-off between increasing
   yield and the level of supporting ecosystem services. The organic farms
   in this study appear to have been intensively managed, with a straight
   substitution of organic inputs for chemicals, but little other effort to
   enhance soil fertility. For example, the organic farms applied large
   quantities of manure compared with conventional farms but conducted
   mechanical weeding (harrowing), whereas conventional farms applied
   herbicides. This repeated soil disturbance may cause rapid organic
   matter mineralisation and undermine the ability of these organic farms
   to retain carbon and nitrogen. The terms `organic' and `conventional'
   agriculture both cover a wide variety of farming methods, some of which
   enhance or deplete ecosystem services more than others. To develop truly
   sustainable methods of agriculture, research should focus on the effects
   of specific farming practices, rather than the labels `conventional' and

   increase in the area of land cultivated for cash-crops (e.g. vegetables
   and orchards) and intensive fertilization and irrigation of this land.
   How this more intensive management and land use for the more profitable
   cash crops affects soil nutrients is of great concern for carbon, soil
   and water quality management In this paper, we attempted to assess the
   influence of cash crop ecosystems on soil nutrients in the catchment

   ecosystems with between 8 and 20 years of intensive management history

   and soybean). Results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) had
   improved, and total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P)
   concentrations had marginally increased under intensive management
   practices in the vegetable and orchard ecosystems in the last 25 years.
   The increases in SOC and total P densities at the 100 cm soil depth in

   the rain fed corn and soybean systems. Soil available P and electrical

   the traditional and cash-cropping systems. Multi regression analysis
   showed that manure and mineral fertilizer contributed significantly to
   the increase in soil nutrients. Intensively managed orchards are a
   better option for improving soil quality and SOC sequestration. However,

  abstract = {{Soil quality indices (SQI) have been suggested in recent decades as
   tools for evaluating soil management practice effects on soil quality.
   With the completion of the GAP project about half of the 3.2 million ha
   of agricultural land (1.7 million ha) will be used for irrigated
   agriculture. New intensive agricultural systems are expected to change
   the soil quality in the region. It is, therefore, imperative to monitor
   the soil quality for sustainable use and management in the region. The
   objective of this research was to determine the effects of soil tillage
   methods (plough and chisel processes and no tillage) of Harran Plain
   selected soil physical and chemical (bulk density, saturation
   percentage, porosity, aggregate stability, organic matter content, soil
   pH, available N, P, and K) properties, all of which were identified as
   possible soil quality indicators. For this purpose this study was
   arranged in randomized blocks with three replications at the
   experimental area of Sanliurfa Rural Development Research Institute in
   1996 and 1997. The results of our 2-year study on the use of a SQI to
   assess were monitored at regular intervals, and yield of the maize were
   compared to soil tillage methods. Data from soil tillage methods were
   used to calculate the SQI values for the different treatments. Results
   revealed that treatment of soil tillage methods improved yield of maize
   bur did not change or increase quality of surface soil as indicated by
   increased values of soil quality indicators. Our results showed that the
   cross tillage with plough be conducted to assess the effects of
   different soil tillage methods on soil quality index and increasing

  abstract = {{New technologies, specific to sustainable agriculture, require
   productivity at least equal to that of conventional technology,
   optimized energy efficiency and, at the same time, diminished
   environmental impact. An energy saving way is that of implementing
   optimal technology specific to each culture and pedoclimatic area. The
   minimum tillage and no-tillage systems represent alternatives to the
   conventional system of soil tillage, due to their conservation effects
   on soil features and to the assured productions, maize: 96-98.1\% at
   minimum tillage and 99.8\% at no-tillage, soybean: 102.9-111.9\% at
   minimum tillage and 117.2\% at no-tillage, wheat: 93.4-96.8\% at minimum
   tillage and 106.9\% at no-tillage, as compared to the conventional
   system. Correct choice of the right soil tillage system for the crops in
   rotation helps reduce energy consumption, thus maize: 97.3-97.9\% at
   minimum tillage and 91.3\% at no-tillage, soybean: 98.6-98.2\% at
   minimum tillage and 92.8\% at no-tillage, wheat: 97.4-98\% at minimum
   tillage and 91.6\% at no-tillage. Energy efficiency is in relation to
   reductions in energy savings, but also with efficiency and impact on the
   tillage system on the cultivated plant. For all crops in rotation,
   energy efficiency (energy produced from 1 MJ consumed) was best in
   no-tillage and 10.44 MJ ha(-1) at maize, 6.49 MJ ha(-1) at soybean and
   5.66 MJ ha(-1) at wheat. Energy-efficient agricultural system: the
   energy consumed-energy produced-energy yield, necessarily have to be
   supplemented by soil energy efficiency, with the conservative effect of
   the agricultural system. Only then the agricultural system will be
   sustainable, durable in agronomic, economic and ecological terms. The
   implementation of minimum and no-tillage soil systems have increased the
   organic matter content from 2 to 7.6\% and water-stable aggregate
   content from 5.6 to 9.6\%, at 0-30 cm depth, as compared to the
   conventional system. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate
   stability have initially been low, the effect of conservation practices
   on the soil characteristics led to a positive impact on the water
   permeability in the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop
   growth led to a better plant watering condition. Subsequent release of

  abstract = {{An attempt was made in this investigation to deteimine the impact of the
   following four systems of soil agricultural use: not subjected to any
   reclamation treatment, fodder-cereal reclamation treatment, rape-cereal
   reclamation treatment and the so-called ``conservation{''} treatment
   (permanent lucerne) on the properties of soils developing from
   post-mining grounds. A particular attention was paid to the properties
   of the humus layer of the developing soils, among them, their texture
   which belongs to the most important soil diagnostic features.
   Experiments were carried out in 2010 on the experimental field of the
   Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of Life
   Sciences in Poznan. A combination without mineral fertilisation (0NPK)
   was established on each of the analysed use systems. In the case of the
   fodder-cereal and rape-cereal systems, additionally, two levels of
   mineral fertilisation: 1NPK in rape-cereal system (rape: 200 kg N, 70 kg
   P2O5, 90 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and in fodder-
   cereal (lucerne: 170 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 150 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40
   kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and 2NPK were applied. The control was post-mining
   ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment.
   The evaluation of changes in the selected, most important soil structure
   parameters was based on the original methodological solution elaborated
   at the Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of
   Life Sciences in Poznan in which the basic element is a regular soil
   aggregate of 1 cm(3) volume. The following parameters were determined
   for such aggregates cut out from two depths of the humus layer (7 and 15
   cm): dynamic water resistance (SW), static water resistance (SW),
   secondary aggregation after dynamic and static water action, time of
   capillary rise (T-kmin), capillary minimal (V-kmin) and maximal (V-kmax)
   water capacity and compression strength (Rc). The above-mentioned
   properties were determined in 5 replications. Using methods commonly
   employed in soil science, the following parameters were determined:
   texture composition, solid phase density, bulk density and porosity,
   hygroscopic capacity and maximal hygroscopic capacity as well as soil
   reaction and carbonate, carbon and nitrogen contents.
   Reclamation treatments applied in the course of the past 32 years and
   soil-forming processes taking place under their influence led to
   distinct changes in the morphological structure of the examined
   profiles, primarily, in their surface layer. The smallest morphological
   changes were observed in the profile sampled from the plot with
   long-term lucerne cultivation (so-called ``conservation{''}). The
   profiles representing the fodder-cereal use system exhibited a more
   advanced stadium of soil-forming processes. Their humus layer was more
   distinctive, with dark colour, its thickness ranged from 20 to 28 cm
   corresponding to the depth of the performed ploughing. Identical
   features and better homogeneity were observed in the case of the humus
   horizon developed in the rape-cereal system of agricultural use,
   although certain differences were recorded in profile morphology
   depending on the level of the applied mineral fertilisation (1NPK and
   2NPK).
   Post-mining ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment
   was found to contain the smallest quantities of organic material carbon
   and nitrogen (2.65-2.84 g.kg(-1)). The amount of oxidisable carbon in
   the fodder-cereal system of agricultural use was 2.5 to 3 times higher
   (6.45-8.82 g.kg(-1)) than in the untreated post-mining ground
   irrespective of the level of mineral fertilisation. On the other hand,
   the amount of carbon was more varied in the rape-cereal system of use.
   In the case of absence of fertilisation (0NPK), this quantity was by
   about 50\% higher in comparison with the post-mining ground and amounted
   to 3.1 g.kg(-1). Elevated fertilisation with 1NPK and 2NPK doses
   increased levels of carbon to values similar as in the fodder-cereal
   system. The highest quantity of carbon of about 12 g.kg(-1) was recorded
   in the humus horizon developed on the surface representing permanent
   lucerne (so-called ``conservation{''}).
   A distinct variability was also observed in the physical properties of
   soils from the examined systems of agricultural use. Untreated
   post-mining grounds were characterised by high bulk density (1.97-2.02
   Mg.m(-3)) and, consequently, by low general porosity (23.6 to 25.3\%).
   In the fodder-cereal use system, soil density was found to be by about
   0.30 Mg.m(-3) lower and porosity by about 10\% higher. In the case of
   the rape-cereal system of agricultural use, soil density was only by
   about 0.1 Mg.m(-3) higher and general porosity by about 5\% lower in
   comparison with the fodder-cereal system. Bulk density and general
   porosity in the so-called ``conservation{''} system of use amounted to
   1.35-1.51 Mg.m(-3) and 42.8-48.9\%, respectively, in other words,
   exhibited the most advantageous values of these features from the point
   of view of agricultural usage.
   Recapitulating, it should be emphasised that widely distinguished two
   soil-forming factors, namely: time and human activity begin to play a
   dominant role in the formation of soils, especially in areas which
   undergo large industrial geomechanical transformations mainly as a
   result of open-cast mining of different minerals.}},

   A long-term (19902006) field experiment was conducted at a typical
   subtropical hilly agriculture region in south central China. The
   objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of long-term
   fertilizations on i) accumulations and distributions of soil carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in different sizes of water-stable
   aggregates (WSA); ii) dynamic change of soil C, N, and P over years; and
   iii) the rice yield. Application of organic materials (OM), especially
   in combination with chemical fertilizers, increased soil organic C
   (SOC), soil total N (NT), and soil total P (PT) concentrations in all
   sizes of WSA, and they more concentrated in WSA (>1 mm). However, single
   chemical fertilizers had little impact on SOC and NT. There were
   significantly positive correlations between SOC and NT in each size of
   WSA, (r0.977, n = 15, P < 0.01). It illuminated that application of
   organic materials benefited the conservation of soil nitrogen. However,
   application of organic materials had less impact on PT. Variation of C/P
   was larger than C/N. PT was mainly affected by input of phosphorus. Data
   over years showed that SOC and NT continued to rise, whereas PT tended
   to decline irrespective of treatments. Furthermore, economical chemical
   fertilizers application combining with green manure and half straw
   returning (NPKe + SR) can produce approximate effects on PT as
   conventional dose of chemical fertilizers (NPKc). Average rice yield of
   NPKc for 17years was 9399kg ha1. Compared with NPKc, OM decreased yield
   by only 4.4\%, which indicated that traditional organic fertilization
   could obtain relatively high yield. NPKe + SR obtained approximate yield

   generated by seven (NT7) and three (NT3) years of applying NT as
   compared to conventional tillage (CT). On three adjacent large plots, a
   field experiment was established since the growing season 2000/01 under
   rain-fed conditions on a clay loam soil in a dry subhumid zone of North
   Tunisia. In NT3 plot, a cultivation of wheat/fava bean sequence was
   investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 450 kg ha(-1)
   were left on the soil surface for wheat and fava bean, respectively. In
   NT7 plot, a cultivation of wheat/sulla sequence was investigated and
   residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 700 kg ha(-1) were left on the
   soil surface for wheat and sulla, respectively. However for the CT plot,
   a moldboard plowing at approximately 20 cm depth was managed for
   continuous wheat production. The selected key parameters evaluated for a
   0-30 cm soil profile were SOM, bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP),
   macro-porosity (MP), micro-porosity (mP), soil water retention at field
   capacity (FC) and at permanent wilting point (PWP), available water
   content (AWC) and soil moisture content (SMC).
   NT7 have increased significantly (p < 0.05) levels of SOM at the top 30
   cm soil layer, which in turn enhanced BD and TP of soil as compared to

   layer with NT3. Both NT3 and NT7 have increased considerably (p < 0.05)
   mP at 030 cm thereby increasing soil water content at FC and PWP,

   reduction was less important in NT7 plot. AWC was significantly (p <

   similar effect to each other. SMC was improved at different soil depths
   by NT system during the whole agricultural season and the highest
   content was found with NT3. Soil moisture values increased with
   increasing soil depth in both NT3 and NT7 indicating a good water
   infiltration induced by these treatments. Hence, water storage
   properties in rooting zone could be enhanced by NT7 and NT3 but water
   availability for plants was more important with NT7. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   satisfactory soil organic-matter (OM) level. This might be achieved by
   sound fertilization management, though impacts of fertilization on OM
   have been rarely investigated with the aid of physical fractionation
   techniques in semiarid regions. This study aimed at examining changes in
   organic C (OC) and N concentrations of physically separated soil OM
   pools after 26 y of fertilization at a site of the semiarid Loess
   Plateau in China. To separate sensitive OM pools, total macro-OM (>
   0.05?mm) was obtained from bulk soil by wet-sieving and then separated
   into light macro-OM (< 1.8 g?cm3) and heavy macro-OM (> 1.8 g?cm3)
   subfractions; bulk soil was also differentiated into light OM (< 1.8
   g?cm3) and mineral-associated OM (> 1.8 g?cm3). Farmyard manure
   increased concentrations of total macro-OC and N by 19\% and 25\%, and
   those of light fraction OC and N by 36\% and 46\%, compared to no
   manuring; both light OC and N concentrations but only total macro-OC
   concentration responded positively to mineral fertilizations compared to
   no mineral fertilization. This demonstrated that the light-fraction OM
   was more sensitive to organic or inorganic fertilization than the total
   macro-OM. Mineral-associated OC and N concentrations also increased by
   manuring or mineral fertilizations, indicating an increase of stable OM
   relative to no fertilization treatment, however, their shares on bulk
   soil OC and N decreased. Mineral fertilizations improved soil OM quality
   by decreasing C : N ratio in the light OM fraction whereas manuring led
   to a decline of the C : N ratio in the total macro-OM fraction, with
   respect to nil treatment. Further fractionation of the total macro-OM
   according to density clarified that across treatments about 3/4 of total
   macro-OM was associated with minerals. Thus, by simultaneously applying
   particle-size and density separation procedures, we clearly demonstrated
   that the macro-OM differed from the light OM fraction not only in its
   chemical composition but also in associations with minerals. The
   proportion of the 0.50.25?mm water-stable aggregates of soil was higher
   under organic or inorganic fertilizations than under no manure or no
   mineral fertilization, and increases in OC and N concentrations of
   water-stable aggregates as affected by fertilization were greater for
   10.5 and 0.50.25?mm classes than for the other classes. Results indicate
   that OM stocks in different soil pools can be increased and the loose
   aggregation of these strongly eroded loess soils can be improved by
   organic or inorganic fertilization.}},

   continuous practice. Separate plots of oat and grazing vetch cover crops
   were grown in winter and then maize was planted in all plots in the
   following summer season. The four fertilization regimes used were: (i)
   fertilizer applied to the cover crops and the maize crop (F1), (ii)
   fertilizer applied to cover crops only (F2), (iii) fertilizer applied to
   the maize crop only (F3) and (iv) no fertilizer applied (F4). Control
   plots (weedy fallows) were included and the treatments were laid out in
   a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soil samples
   from 0-5, 5-20 and 20-50 cm depths were analyzed for total SOM,
   particulate organic matter (POM) fractions, hot water soluble C (HWC)
   and C-associated with water stable macro- and micro-aggregates (WSAC).
   While total SOM was more concentrated in the 0-5 cm soil depth across
   treatments, a lack of maize fertilization (F2 and F4 regimes)
   significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the stratification ratio. Oat and
   grazing vetch rotations produced significantly higher (P < 0.05) fine

   When fertilized, oat was better able to support SOM sequestration in

   effective at 20-50 cm. The F3 regime had similar SOM levels as the F2.
   When no fertilizer was applied (F4-regime), there were significant (P <

   weedy fallow-maize rotations whereas the grazing vetch-maize rotation
   did not respond, both at 0-5 and 5-20 cm. The findings suggested that in
   the low fertilizer input CA system, targeting fertilizer to the winter
   cover crop as opposed to the maize crop could give similar SOM response,

   better suited to low N input CA systems for SOM improvement. (C) 2012

   assessed land use impact on glomalin related soil proteins (GRSPs), soil

   Forest, short fallow and field crop production soil samples were used to
   determine GRSPs, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water stable aggregate
   (WSA(1-2mm)). Results showed that GRSPs significantly decreased from the
   forest to fallow and the field crop production systems. The easily
   extractable GRSP (EEGRSP) was 30\% and 39\% less under fallow and field
   crop production respectively, relative to the forest soils. Similarly,
   total GRSP (TGRSP) was 17\% and 46\% less under fallow and field crop
   production respectively, relative to the forest soils. C, N, and organic
   matter (OM) did not change significantly within the land use systems.
   The WSA(1-2mm) was 20\% less under fallow, and 33\% less under field
   crop production relative to the forest system. However, AMF spores
   augmented from forest to fallow and field crop production system. There
   was a positive correlation between GRSPs (EEGRSP, TGRSP) and AM fungal
   spore density suggesting the possible implication of these fungi to the
   production of the GRSP in this zone. There was also a positive
   correlation between C, N and EEGRSP, suggesting the implication of GRSP

   TGRSP, C and OM, suggesting the possible coactions of GRSP, OM to the
   formation of WSA(1-2mm), and thereby promoting the build up of soil
   structure. These results highlight the view that GRSP can be used as an
   indicator of soil quality in this region and should be considered as a
   criteria when define agricultural management strategies. AM fungal and

  abstract = {{Land abandonment might be an alternative management for restoring soil
   conditions and C from prolonged cultivation and agricultural practices.
   In the present study, the influence of 18-22 years of land abandonment
   on soil properties, C dynamics and microbial biomass was evaluated in
   closely situated wheat and alfalfa farmlands, and abandoned lands on
   calcareous soils, Central Iran.
   Soil properties of the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths from abandoned lands
   were compared to those from conventionally cultivated lands (i.e.,
   continuous wheat-fallow and alfalfa-wheat rotation) common in calcareous
   soils of Central Zagros Mountains.
   Soil bulk density in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers decreased
   significantly while total porosity increased significantly in abandoned
   lands. Generally, soil aggregate stability tended to increase within the
   abandoned fields owing to increased water-stable macro-aggregates. Soil
   organic C (OC) contents (g kg(-1)) and pools (Mg ha(-1)) in the 0-15 cm
   soil layer increased significantly in abandoned lands compared with
   cultivated lands, with no effect in the 15-30 cm soil layer after 18-22
   years of land abandonment, suggesting the restoration of C is pronounced
   in the upper 0-15 cm soil depth . The total C accumulation in abandoned
   lands was 7.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the entire sampling depth (0-30 cm) over
   the 18-22 years of land abandonment, which was 26\% greater relative to
   cultivated lands. Carbon mineralization (Cmin) followed a trend similar
   to organic C, whereas C turnover (Cmin/OC ratio) was slightly greater in
   wheat fields. However, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) did not vary
   considerably among the three land uses.
   In brief, improvements, albeit slowly, in soil properties of the top
   layer with the cessation of cultivation indicated that land abandonment
   may result in enhanced soil C sequestration, and would maintain
   fertility and productivity of the farmlands of semi-arid climates.}},

   straw managements (standing up, lying down and fragmented). After the
   tractor passage, penetration resistance, water content, density and
   total porosity of soil were evaluated on the area where the wheel passed
   over. Density and porosity were not affected by wheel traffic.
   Treatments with straw had higher water content and as a result less
   resistance. There was no significant difference on resistance and soil
   moisture among straw management treatments. For an equal soil water
   content, higher densities of straw resulted in lower penetration
   resistance, which indicates less compaction.}},

  abstract = {{It is generally believed that plantations of Eucalyptus bring about a

   properties were measured across a range of E. grandis plantation ages
   (1-10 years) in south-western China to determine whether and how
   eucalypt afforestation of agricultural land affected the soil fertility.
   The results indicate that afforestation with E. grandis caused changes
   in soil properties with soil depth, and the changes were dependent on
   the stand age. Soil bulk density decreased significantly, but
   water-holding capacity increased significantly with time. Soil organic
   matter content, C:N ratio, and soil microbial biomass C and N
   concentrations showed an initial phase of decline and then increased
   significantly over time in the upper soil layers of E. grandis
   plantations aged from 1 to 4 or 5 years. Soil pH in E. grandis
   plantations did not change significantly with stand age or soil layer.
   Cation exchange capacity in the upper soil layer of E. grandis
   plantations increased significantly over time. Total exchangeable bases
   and base saturation in the soil decreased significantly with depth and
   with increasing plantation age. Furthermore, E. grandis afforestation of
   arable soils had no significant effects on total N, total P, and
   available P contents. The requirements of the trees, understory
   microenvironmental conditions, and allelopathic effects might play
   important roles in the dynamic changes of soil physicochemical and
   microbiological properties. The results demonstrate the progressive
   development of processes that lead to the restoration of soil fertility
   following E. grandis afforestation of arable soils. However, most of the
   properties measured for the afforested soils resembled the properties of
   arable soils and did not resemble those of the soil of control forests.
   Thus, reversion of soil properties in the study plantations is likely to
   require a considerable period of time. Long-term research is needed to
   understand changes in the soil properties resulting from afforestation
   with Eucalyptus and to predict future trends.}},

   aggregates, the average diameter, the geometric mean diameter,
   aggregates larger than 2 mm and SOC. Data were subjected to analysis of
   variance (F test) following a randomized complete block design with

   only as a reference soil in natural state and therefore were not
   considered as a factor of variation in the analysis of variance. The
   values of aggregation index with the soil organic carbon stock were
   subjected to Pearson correlation (p <= 0.05). The effect of residual
   doses of guava seeds on the soil organic carbon from 0.00 to 0.20 m of

   differ in relation to soil aggregation; however, SOC was directly
   related to the amount of residues applied to the soil. There was
   significant positive correlation between aggregation index and SOC. The

   practices on soil fertility indices is either limited or nonexistent.
   This study was conducted to compare the effects of 10 years of various
   management practices, citrus intercropped with white clover (WC), citrus
   mulched with straw (SM), citrus intercropped with contour hedgerows
   (CH), citrus orchard land with impermeable membrane (IM), and citrus
   intercropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum) and peanut (Arachris
   hypogaea) (WP), as treatments on soil fertility indices with that of the
   conventional citrus management (CM). Results showed that the soil
   organic carbon, total and available nitrogen, available potassium, and
   water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at the 0-5 cm depth were
   higher for the WC and SM treatments than the CM treatment. There was
   also spatial variation in soil fertility along slopes of the WC and SM
   treatments. The soil total and available nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   potassium, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at both the
   0-5 and 5-20 cm depths were higher for the CH and IM treatments than the
   CM treatment. The average soil available nitrogen and available
   potassium contents were higher for the WP treatment than the CM
   treatment, but the WP treatment had little effect on the soil organic
   carbon, total nitrogen, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents.
   These suggested that white clover intercropping and straw mulching were
   the most effective approaches to improve soil fertility in citrus

   Greater understanding of how climatic variability affects net CO2

   losses. Since 2002, we continuously measured NEE (i.e. eddy covariance
   technique) on an upland grassland site (7 ha), divided in two paddocks
   grazed by heifers (intensive: 1 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), 213 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1) and extensive: 0.5 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), no fertilization). For
   years with dry and warm growing seasons (i.e. 2003, 2005 and 2008),
   absolute annual NEE was higher in the intensive paddock compared with
   the extensive paddock. The opposite was observed during years of ample
   seasonal rainfall and soil moisture (i.e. 2004, 2006 and 2007).
   Contrasted management led to two distinct plant communities being
   different in leaf area index (LAI), soil bulk density and soil water
   holding capacity. Differences in annual NEEs could thus be assigned to
   interactions between in carbon and water fluxes during dry and wet
   growth periods. Dry growth periods led to a reduction in weekly gross
   primary productivity (GPP) in the extensively managed paddock, whereas
   the GPP was maintained in the intensive paddock. In turn, during wet
   growth periods, GPP was similar in both paddocks, whereas N amendment
   and frequent defoliation significantly increased ecosystem respiration
   in the intensive paddock, presumably through a higher heterotrophic
   respiration following on a better C substrate quality and availability
   (rhizodeposition and senescent fine roots). In the extensive paddock,
   where plant cover was denser (reducing soil temperature) and less
   decomposable, C losses through heterotrophic respiration were
   comparatively smaller under wet conditions. Our results demonstrate that
   grassland subjected to a moderately intensive management could be more
   resilient in terms of carbon storage during drought and heat waves,

   Results indicated that the land use and management systems induced

   This was inferred from the higher values of soil Ds, maximum bulk
   density, and relative bulk density, and the lower values of

   of the soil to an extent that it becomes dependant on management
   practices and soil resilience. Agroforestry systems (AFs) mimic
   characteristics of natural ecosystems such as multistrata canopy and
   deep rooting and may minimize the consequences of these changes by
   providing soil protection and maintenance of conditions similar to those
   under natural vegetation. This study evaluates the physical properties
   of a Luvisol at a site where since 1997 alternative agro-forestry
   systems (AFs) (agrosilvipasture-AGP and silvipasture-SILV), conventional
   crop management (CCM) and natural vegetation (NV) have been maintained.
   Undisturbed soil cores were collected in 2005 and submitted to a range
   of matric suction for which soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration
   resistance (Q) and soil water content (theta) were determined. Water
   retention and penetration resistance were used to determine the least
   limiting water range (LLWR) and the slope of the soil water retention
   curve at its inflection point (S-value). Particle size, total organic
   carbon (TOC) and particle density were determined using the disturbed
   soil samples. Water retention and porosity followed the sequence
   NV>SILV>CCM>AGP. The AFs studied (AGP and SILV) improved or maintained
   soil physical quality when compared to NV with no significant
   differences between the S-values of 0.044, 0.042 and 0.050,
   respectively. However, the S-value of 0.035 for CCM indicates that this
   management was unable to maintain soil physical quality on the same
   levels as AFs and NV. The decrease of LLWR with BD occurred for all
   treatments, and the BD at a maximum effect (LLWR=0) which is called the
   critical BD (BD(c)), was, respectively, 1.69, 1.62, 1.56 and 1.56 Mg
   m(-3) for AGP, SILV, NV and CCM. The larger values of LLWR for AFs (AGP
   and SILV) are similar to the value for NV, with associated superior
   aeration, matric suction and reduced resistance to penetration by roots.
   Indices such as LLWR and S-value were suitably sensitive and could be
   used in future research, but it is important to identify other potential
   indices for these situations that can show how quickly changes in soil
   quality may occur. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effects of different
   land use patterns on soil aggregate stability and the distribution of
   organic carbon in different aggregate fractions in order to prove that
   the different land use patterns enhance soil aggregate stability. Five
   kinds of soil samples were collected from the hilly area of western
   Sichuan under different land use patterns, such as abandoned farmlands,
   eucalyptus plantations, Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and
   loquat orchards. The results demonstrated that the five land use
   patterns had high proportions of aggregates at the size of > 2 mm after
   dry sieving, and had high proportions of aggregates at the size of < 0.5
   mm after wet sieving. The aggregation abilities of the soils were
   significantly different depending on land use patterns. Water-stable
   aggregate stability was highest in the Chinese fir plantations, followed
   by eucalyptus plantations and tea plantations. Water-stable aggregate
   stability was the lowest in loquat orchards and abandoned farmlands.
   Except for coarse particle, soil particle contents of the same size were
   affected according to the different land use patterns. As the size of
   aggregates decreased, the organic carbon content of the soil aggregates
   in tea plantations increased after a decrease, and then reduced again.
   However, the organic carbon contents of soil aggregates in other land
   uses increased continuously with the decreasing size of aggregates.
   Organic carbon content of the soil aggregates was strongly increased in
   land areas that had been converted from abandoned farmland to Chinese
   fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards, while it was
   decreased when abandoned farmland was converted to eucalyptus
   plantations. The results provided the basis of implementation of
   returning farmland to forest and the process of carbon sequestration in

  abstract = {{Contrary to earlier studies, this study suggests that even one year of
   tillage within a long-term no-till agroecosystem adversely affected the
   soil quality, with possible negative impact on crop yields. Worldwide
   interest in conservation tillage is increasing, because conventional
   tillage adversely impacts the long-term quality of the soil and its
   vulnerability to erosion. No-till agriculture minimizes adverse impacts
   of an intensive arable land use. In some cases, occasional tillage is
   used as a means of weed or pathogen control. Therefore, this study was
   conducted in eastern Ohio to examine soil quality as affected by
   occasional tillage, i.e. disk plowed every 3-4 years, within a long-term
   no-till agroecosystem. The study compared the soil characteristics
   between two fields, both under corn (Zea mays L.) at the time of the
   study. Soil properties were studied for three depths of 0-6, 6-12, and
   12-18 cm. Compared with the continuous no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly higher bulk density of 1.45 versus
   1.31 gcm(-3), and somewhat higher soil penetration resistance of 1.77
   versus 1.56 MPa. Also, compared with the no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly lower water stable aggregate of 475
   versus 834 gkg(-1), mean weight diameter of 1.4 versus 3.4 mm, field
   moisture capacity of 293 versus 360 gkg(-1), equilibrium infiltration
   rate of 2.0 versus 6.7 mm min(-1), and cumulative infiltration of 353.4
   versus 1,211.8 mm. The field under occasional tillage had somewhat lower
   soil organic carbon of 16.0 versus 19.2 gkg(-1), soil water sorptivity
   of 16.3 versus 36.5 mm min(-0.5), and transmissivity of 2.1 versus 4.9
   mm min(-1). The occasional tillage had no effect on the soil shear
   strength. In general, the effect of tillage on soil properties decreased
   with increase in soil depth. Also corn yields were compared between the
   two agroecosystems. Compared with the no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly lower grain moisture content of
   22.4 versus 28.2\%, and somewhat lower wet stover biomass of 14.6 versus
   20.2 Mg ha(-1), wet corn ear yield of 10.0 versus 11.4 Mg ha(-1), and
   dry grain yield of 8.2 versus 9.4 Mg ha(-1). As contrasted with earlier
   studies which were conducted under controlled research plots, this study
   was conducted under on-farm conditions.}},

  abstract = {{Organic farming and improvements to agricultural sustainability are
   often seen as synonymous. However, an extensive European review
   demonstrated that in practice this is not always true. This study aims
   to compare the status of soil and water properties between separate
   fields managed in either an organic or a conventional manner. Soil
   samples were collected from 16 pairs of farms, throughout England, with
   both arable and grass fields within each pair on similar soil type.
   Chemical (nutrients, pesticides, herbicides) and physical (aggregate
   stability, field capacity, shear strength, soil organic matter,
   infiltration rates) soil properties were measured in four main soil
   texture classes in organic and conventional fields. The physical soil
   properties varied significantly between the different classes of texture
   and land use. The heavier textured soils have significantly higher soil
   organic carbon (SOC), aggregate stability and shear strength. The
   coarse-textured soils have significantly lower field capacity moisture
   contents. The grassland has a significantly higher level of SOC, field
   capacity moisture content, aggregate stability and soil shear strength.
   However, there were no significant differences between organic and
   conventional treatments for any of the soil physical properties
   measured. There were fewer traces of agrochemicals in the soil water
   from the organic fields compared with the conventionally managed fields.
   The conventional arable fields had higher levels of total inorganic
   nitrogen than the other land uses and treatments. There was evidence to
   show that infiltration rates were significantly higher on organically
   managed grassland soils (7.6 mm/h) than conventionally managed grassland
   (2.5 mm/h) with lower stocking rates. The results suggest that improved
   grassland management, whether organic or conventional, could reduce
   predicted runoff by 28\%.}},

  abstract = {{Establishment of buffers and incorporation of trees and shrubs are
   believed to improve soil quality and thereby improve water quality from
   grazed pasture systems. Although enzyme activities and water stable
   aggregates have been identified as measurable soil quality parameters
   for early responses to changes in soil management, the literature lacks
   information on those parameters for grazing systems with agroforestry
   buffers. The objective of this study was to examine the activities of
   fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase
   and beta-glucosaminidase, the percentage of water stable aggregates
   (WSA) and soil organic carbon and nitrogen as soil quality parameters
   for grazed pasture and row-crop systems. The study consisted of four
   management treatments: grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB),
   grass buffer (GB) and row-crop (RC). The WSA was determined by wet
   sieving method while the enzyme activities were colorimetrically
   quantified using a spectrophotometer in laboratory assays. Soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were also determined. Two
   soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed for all treatments. The
   row-crop treatment showed significantly lower activities compared to all
   other treatments for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes
   along with lower WSA. The dehydrogenase activities were significantly
   higher in GP treatment compared to RC treatment. The FDA hydrolase
   activities were not significantly different among treatments. Surface
   soil revealed higher enzyme activities and higher WSA than the
   subsurface soil. The treatment by depth interaction was significant for
   beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes. The soil organic
   carbon and total nitrogen data strongly supported the results of enzyme
   activities and WSA. Implications can be made that perennial vegetation
   enhances organic matter accumulation in the soil, has minimum
   disturbance to the soil and will have positive impacts on the ecosystem.

   New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or

   agriculture. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of two
   olive mill wastes (olive leaves and ``alperujo{''}) on soil properties
   and soil erosion in a rain fed olive grove in SE Spain. After three
   years experiment, oil mill wastes application significantly improved
   physical and chemical properties of the studied soil with respect to

   increased, which confirmed the interactions of these properties.
   Available water capacity increased with olive leaves but decreased when
   applied ``alperujo{''}. With respect to erosion, after simulated
   rainfall experiments it was found that the oil mill wastes contributed
   to increase the roughness and the interception of raindrops, delaying
   runoff generation and enhancing the infiltration of rainwater. Treatment
   with oil mill wastes contributed to a reduction in runoff generation and
   soil losses compared to bare soil, especially when applied olive leaves.

   management is important for soil quality and agricultural productivity,
   and for the persistence of soil faunal diversity and biomass. Little is
   known about the interactive effects of soil fertility management and
   soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and SOM dynamics in
   tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term
   trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic
   inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil
   macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable
   aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as
   well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed
   arable systems were compared to a long-term green fallow system
   representing a relatively undisturbed reference.
   Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with
   fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as
   well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the
   soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the
   percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within
   macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with
   whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters.
   Factor analysis showed that 35.3\% of the total sample variation in
   aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was
   explained by earthworm parameters, and 25.5\% by termite parameters.
   Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome.
   The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total
   macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be
   linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the
   arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that
   feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small
   excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm
   abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of
   management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools
   than differences in termite populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   Primary forest and farm fields deforested between 1930 and 2000 were

   Two traditional long-term management systems were sampled: continuous
   low-input maize (Zea mays; Co), and kitchen garden (Ki) polyculture with
   organic inputs. Physical, biological, and chemical SQ indicators were
   measured. Degradation in Co followed exponential decay trends for most
   indicators (organic matter, active C, water-stable aggregates, available
   water capacity, electrical conductivity, CEC, pH, Ca, Mg and Zn), as
   well as for yield. Organic matter quality declined linearly, suggesting
   degradation will continue. For both parent materials and most indicators
   degradation of 25-93\% below initial values resulted, but with <= 40\%
   further drop below initial values and for more indicators under Co than
   Ki. P. Zn and possibly K accumulated over time under Ki. The extent of
   degradation was influenced by parent material. In conclusion, a basic
   accessible set of SQ indicators was successfully used to describe soil
   degradation dynamics under cultivation. Results suggest that regular
