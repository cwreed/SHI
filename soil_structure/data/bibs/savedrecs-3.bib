Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine the effect of the mucilage
   extracted from Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) as soil amendment on
   soil physical properties and on the sorption-desorption behaviour of
   four herbicides (MCPA, Diuron, Clomazone and Terbuthylazine) used in
   cereal crops. Three soils of different texture (sandy-loam, loam and
   clay-loam) were selected, and mercury intrusion porosimetry and surface
   area analysis were used to examine changes in the microstructural
   characteristics caused by the reactions that occur between the mucilage
   and soil particles. Laboratory studies were conducted to characterise
   the selected herbicides with regard their sorption on tested soils added
   or not with the mucilage.
   Mucilage amendment resulted in a reduction in soil porosity, basically
   due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 10 mu m) and an important
   increase in finer pores (radius < 10 mu m) and in partcles' surface. A
   higher herbicide sorption in the amended soils was ascertained when
   compared to unamended soils. The sorption percentage of herbicides in
   soils treated with mucilage increased in the order; sandy-loam < loam <
   clay-loam.
   The increase in the organic carbon content upon amendment and the
   natural clay content of the soils are revealed to be responsible for the
   higher adsorption of Diuron when compared with Terbuthylazine, Clomazone
   and MCPA. Desorption of the herbicides was highly inhibited in the soils
   treated with mucilage; only Terbuthylazine showed a slight desorption in
   the case of loam and clay loam-soils.
   This study leads to the conclusion thatmucilage from Chia seeds used as
   soil conditioner can reduce the mobility of herbicides tested in
   agricultural soils with different physico-chemical properties. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Slope gradient and land use change are known to influence soil quality
   and the assessment of soil quality is important in determining
   sustainable land-use and soil-management practices. In this study, soil
   quality indices (SQIs) were developed by quantifying several soil
   properties to discriminate the effects of slope gradient and land use
   change on soil quality in 480 km(2) of agricultural land in Kurdistan
   Province, Iran. Three soil quality indices (SQIs) were used. Each of the
   soil quality indices was calculated using two linear and non-linear
   scoring methods and two soil indicator selection approaches, a Total
   Data Set (TDS) and a Minimum Data Set (MDS). Nine soil quality
   indicators: pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Carbon (OC),
   Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Total Naturalized Value (TNV), Soil
   Erodibility (K), Porosity (P), Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), and Bulk
   Density (BD) and soil loss rate were measured for 110 soil samples (0-30
   cm depth). Soil quality indices maps were developed using digital soil
   mapping methods. The > 10\% slope class had the highest soil loss rate
   and highest percentage of soils with very low quality (grade V) based on
   all SQIs. The results showed that soil quality was better estimated
   using the Weighted Additive Soil Quality Index (SQI(w)) (r(2) = 0.78)
   compared to SQI(a) (the Additive Soil Quality Index) and SQI(n) (the
   Nemoro Soil Quality Index). The agreement values of all SQIs for the
   non-linear scoring method were higher than the linear scoring method.
   The mean values of all SQIs and the soil loss rate were higher and lower
   in rangeland than cropland, respectively, but they were not
   significantly different because of intensive grazing. Slopes with a
   large gradient and where land use was converted to agriculture were
   characterized by low values of SQIs, suggesting a recovery of soil
   quality through changing to sustainable practices and abandoning over
   grazing in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean vineyards are usually managed with continuous tillage to

   degradation. Vineyards are part of the Mediterranean culture, their
   management can be sustainable. We propose the setup of two types of
   groundcovers with the aim to assess their potential influence to improve
   soil properties. A field trial was performed to compare the effects of a
   seeded (Brachypodium distachyon) and spontaneous groundcovers, on a set
   of soil parameters, in comparison with the traditional tillage in four
   vineyards located in the center of Spain. Three years after the
   groundcovers establishment soil organic carbon stocks increased up to
   1.62 and 3.18 Mg ha(-1) for the seeded and the spontaneous groundcovers,
   respectively, compared to conventional tillage. Both labile and stable
   fractions improved their soil organic carbon content with the use of
   groundcovers, particularly the labile fraction. Moreover, soil structure
   and functional soil properties improved through better aggregate
   stability, pore connectivity and infiltration rates. The higher root
   biomass input of the spontaneous groundcovers derived in higher soil
   organic carbon increases and soil quality improvement. Consequently,
   under low rainfall conditions (<400 mm per year) spontaneous vegetation,
   properly managed according to site conditions, is an effective soil
   management strategy to revert soil degradation and increase soil quality

Abstract = {{Coarse sandy soils have poor water retention capacity, which may
   constrain crop growth during drought. We investigated the effect of
   biochar amendment to subsoil on crop physiological processes and maize
   yield, comparing irrigated and drought conditions. A two-year greenhouse
   experiment was conducted with one-time application of straw biochar at
   concentrations of 0\%, 1\%, 2\% and 3\% (B0, B1, B2 and B3). Maize was
   planted twice in the same large pots one week and again 12months after
   biochar application. Plants were fully irrigated until flowering;
   thereafter, half of them were subjected to drought. Our results indicate
   B2 and B3 increased soil water content at field capacity. Leaf water
   potential, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration were
   maintained in B2 and B3 during the drying cycle in year one and in all
   biochar levels in year two. In the first year, B3 induced negative root
   geotropism and significantly reduced vegetative biomass under both
   irrigation schemes. Cob biomass was significantly reduced by B1 under
   full irrigation. In year two, B3 significantly increased cob biomass
   under drought. Nitrogen uptake was significantly reduced by B2 in year
   one, but increased significantly in B3 in year two. In both years, P
   uptake was significantly increased by B2 and B3. Furthermore, K uptake
   was significantly increased in B2 in year one and in all biochar
   treatments in year two. Overall, biochar improved water content of
   coarse sandy soil due to decreased bulk density and increased porosity
   after biochar amendment, consequently, improving crop physiological
   processes including transpiration and photosynthesis. Significant
   effects on yields tended to be more negative in the first year, and
   neutral to positive in the second year suggesting the enhancement of
   biochar effects with ageing. The positive effect in the second year
   shows biochar's potential for improving agriculture productivity in
   drought-prone regions.}},

Abstract = {{Improper soil management, increasing farm machinery mass and traffic
   frequency threaten the ecological functionality of soils under intensive
   agricultural use. Especially in Brazil, no-tillage (NT) cropping was
   adopted as a type of soil management that possibly preserves soil
   functions. Hence, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the
   effect and intensity of long-term NT compared to soil under natural
   forest (NF) or grassland (NG) based on parameters of composition
   (density, porosity, water retention) and functionality by means of
   mechanical strength (precompression stress sigma(p), cyclic
   compressibility c(n)), air permeability K-a, and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity k(s). The studied Hapludox, Hapludalf and Quartzipsamment
   from southern Brazil under subtropical climate mostly reacted based upon
   their grain size distribution, namely clay, loamy sand and loamy fine
   sand. The largest impact appeared in the Hapludox, where compaction
   occurred (higher sigma(p), lower c(n) and smaller porosity, especially
   macroporosity). k(s) and K-a were highest at the surface of the Hapludox
   under NF, but were reduced strongly under NT. In both the Hapludox and
   the Hapludalf deeper soil layers were also affected by NT, but in the
   clayey Hapludox the applied pressure resulted in the largest compacted
   layer. The Hapludalf of loamy sand texture showed, supposedly due to
   shallow soil operations, a weak, but permeable surface layer under NT
   above a dense layer, while the other layers were only slightly affected
   by cropping. In the Quartzipsamment, there was no increase in or, and
   little in cm whereas density in deeper layers slightly decreased. While
   k(s) was increased strongly under NT compared to NG, the opposite was
   found for K-a which could not be explained by the investigated
   parameters. The results demonstrate that soil under NT might be
   significantly affected by soil compaction with regard to soil functions
   if not adequately managed by adjusted machinery. This is of even greater
   importance in fine-textured soils like the investigated Hapludox,
   compared to coarse-textured soils of poor aggregation like the

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas and a catalyst of
   stratospheric ozone decay. Agricultural soils are the source of 75\% of
   anthropogenic N2O emissions globally. Recently, significant attention
   has been directed at examining effects of conservation tillage on carbon
   sequestration in agricultural systems. However, limited knowledge is
   available regarding how these practices impact N2O emissions, especially
   for organic vegetable production systems. In this context, a three-year
   study was conducted in a well-drained sandy loam field transitioning to
   organic vegetable production in the Mid-Atlantic coastal plain of USA to
   investigate impacts of conservation tillage {[}strip till (ST) and
   no-till (NT)] and conventional tillage (CT) {[}with black plastic mulch
   (CT-BP) and bare-ground (CT-BG)] on N2O emissions. Each year, a winter
   cover crop mixture (forage radish: Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus,
   crimson clover: Trifolium incarnatum L., and rye: Secale cereale L.) was
   grown and flail-mowed in the spring. Nearly 80\% of annual N2O-nitrogen
   (N) emissions occurred during the vegetable growing season for all
   treatments. Annual N2O-N emissions were greater in CT-BP than in ST and
   NT, and greater in CT-BG than in NT, but not different between CT-BG and
   CT-BP, ST and NT, or CT-BG and ST. Conventional tillage promoted N
   mineralization and plastic mulch increased soil temperature, which
   contributed to greater N2O-N fluxes. Though water filled porosity in NT
   was higher and correlated well with N2O-N fluxes, annual N2O-N emissions
   were lowest in NT suggesting a lack of substrates for nitrification and
   denitrification processes. Crop yield was lowest in NT in Year 1 and
   CT-BP in Year 3 but yield-scaled N2O-N emissions were consistently
   greatest in CT-BP and lowest in NT each year. Our results suggest that
   for coarse-textured soils in the coastal plain with winter cover crops,
   conservation tillage practices may reduce N2O emissions in organic

Abstract = {{Historically, much of the New England landscape was converted to pasture
   for grazing animals and harvesting hay. Both consumer demand for local
   sustainably produced food, and the number of small farms is increasing
   in RI, highlighting the importance of characterizing the effects
   livestock have on the quality of pasture soils. To assess how livestock
   affect pasture on Charlton and Canton soils series in RI, we examined
   soil quality in farms raising beef cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis
   aries), and horses (Equus ferus caballus), using hayed pastures as a
   control. We sampled three pastures per livestock type and three control
   hayed pastures in May, August, and October 2012. Hay fields and pastures
   grazed by sheep had statistically significant (P < 0.001) better soil
   quality than pastures grazed by beef cattle or horses. This was driven
   by parameters including penetration resistance, bulk density, aggregate
   stability, and infiltration rate. Hayfields also showed higher soil
   quality measures than grazed pastures for organic matter content and
   active C. In addition, significant differences in nitrate and phosphate
   concentrations were observed among livestock types. Respiration and
   infiltration rates, pH, and ammonium concentrations, on the other hand,
   did not differ significantly among pasture types. When all soil quality
   indicators in this study were weighed equally, soil quality scores
   followed the order: hay > sheep > beef cattle > horses. The results of
   our study provide baseline data on the effect different types of
   livestock have on pasture soil quality in RI, which may be useful in
   making sound land use and agricultural management decisions.}},

   along the Rio Grande in western Texas}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{87-100}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Growing populations demand more food, putting more pressure on soil
   productivity and sustainability around the world. In western Texas along
   the Rio Grande Valley, the low natural rainfall requires frequent
   irrigations for sustaining agriculture. To investigate the impacts of
   irrigation on soil quality, we collected and modelled geochemical data
   (major elements and nutrients) on irrigation water, soil pore water,
   drainage water, and soil samples, and monitored soil moisture,
   temperature, and electrical conductivity with sensors from two pecan,
   one cotton, and one alfalfa fields in western Texas.
   This study showed that flood irrigation with both surface (Rio Grande
   river) and ground waters significantly increased the root-zone salinity,
   soil sodicity, and nutrient leaching from soils to the underlying
   aquifers and Rio Grande river from agricultural fields of the arid
   southwest. The water used for irrigation was high in total dissolved
   solids (> 500 ppm generally), dominated by Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ and SO42-.
   After flood irrigation, infiltrating water dissolved salts such as
   gypsum that have accumulated in the soils due to previous irrigations,
   or/and mixed existing concentrated soil waters, and approached
   saturation with respect to these evaporite minerals. Soil water was
   supersaturated with respect to carbonates as pedogenic calcite
   precipitated out and reached concentrations of similar to 10 wt\% of
   total soil mass. This suggested that pedogenic carbonate is an important
   carbon reservoir and precipitation kinetics and controls of such
   secondary calcite need further investigation for the irrigated
   agricultural fields in arid regions of the world.
   Chemistry of agricultural return flow samples collected from drainage
   ditches was similar to that of irrigation water, suggesting that most of
   the irrigation water had taken a shallow and short flowpath through the
   fields to drains. Between irrigation events, soil water became more
   concentrated as water was lost through evapo-transpiration that led to
   precipitation of evaporite salts. As a result, sodicity and salinity of
   soils, especially clayey soils, frequently exceeded the tolerance levels
   of major crops grown in the region. Here in these fine-textured soils,
   combination of high evapotranspiration rates, intensive irrigation with
   water of elevated salinity, and limited infiltration stunted crop
   growth, decreased soil porosity and permeability, led to poor aeration,
   and accelerated salt buildup via a positive feedback mechanism.
   During initial irrigation where soils were saturated, soil water also
   percolated and recharged to underlying aquifers, and thus salts,
   nutrients, and trace metals from agricultural practices (i.e.,
   application of fertilizers, irrigation, soil amendments, and pesticide)
   could be mobilized to shallow groundwaters. This implied that chemistry
   of Rio Grande river, groundwater, and soil was closely linked. Thus the
   sustainability of agriculture depended on appropriate water, soil and
   crop management practices.}},

   quality and wheat yield}},
Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{180-187}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When crop-pasture rotations are converted to continuous no-till annual
   cropping systems, the grain yield of wheat crops in the rotation
   stagnates or declines in response to the number of years of continuous
   cropping (YCC). We studied the soil properties underlining the response
   of wheat yield to YCC in 80 on-farm trials during three growing seasons.
   We determined the frontier yield and the yield gap under limited
   (Y-F(-), or best technical means) and unlimited nutrient supply (Y-F(+),
   supplemental additions of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur).
   For each field, we assessed soil quality based on soil organic carbon
   (SOC), phosphorus (Bray I), soil texture, field water infiltration rate
   (INF), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN). We also calculated
   a climatological index (CI) that combines temperature, radiation and
   precipitation during both the spike and early grain growth phases. We
   estimated Y-F(-) and Y(F)(+)using stochastic frontier production
   functions with CI, YCC and soil properties as predictor variables. The
   Y-F(-) and Y-F(+) after a perennial pasture were 6.9 and 8.4 Mg ha(-1),
   with the 1.5 Mg ha(-1) yield gap attributable to nutrient supply
   limitations. However, while Y-F(-) declined by 0.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) from
   YCC = 1 to 10 (P <= 0.05), Y-F(+) stayed at roughly the same level till
   YCC = 5, declining thereafter by 0.17 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (P <= 0.05).
   Reduced soil nutrient supply capacity, partially quantified as PMN and
   amendable with supplemental fertilization, limited 17 during the first
   five years after pasture. The subsequent 17 decline could not be
   compensated by increased nutrient supply. After 10 years, the yield gap
   between Y-F(+) for YCC = 1 and Y-F(-) for YCC = 10, increased to 2.6 Mg
   ha(-1). Up to 40\% of this gap was explained by a deterioration of the
   soil quality that was independent of the nutrient supply; the decline
   after five years of continuous cropping was best explained by INF. Thus,
   continuous annual cropping under no-till generated a progressive
   increase in the wheat yield gap associated to deterioration in soil
   quality that could be corrected with supplemental fertilization only in
   the first years after a pasture, but not thereafter, when soil physical
   properties seemed to degrade past a threshold that limited wheat yield
   and reduced nutrient use efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to (1) examine the challenges in the compost facilities
   of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), (2) optimize the composting
   techniques using indigenous natural zeolite and locally produced biochar

   economic benefits of optimized food waste composting. In KSA food waste
   is the most abundant stream of municipal solid waste that contribute up
   to 50\% of the total waste. The landfill disposal of this waste results
   in several environmental and public health issues. Resource recovery
   through composting is one of the best approaches for treating such
   nutrient-rich organic waste. There exist several facilities in KSA for
   the conversion of food waste to compost using conventional methods of
   compost piles and trenches. However, none of the produced compost is
   capable of improving the quality and fertility of sandy soils and the
   growth of the crops due to limited values of organic matter, nutrients
   and water holding capacity along with high moisture contents,
   nitrification index, weed seed contents and ammonia emissions. In KSA,
   vast reservoirs of natural zeolite are available near to Jeddah city.
   Similarly, in KSA the most cultivated tree is date palm with more than
   22 million date trees that would provide sufficient feedstock for

Abstract = {{Volcanic soils are extremely productive thanks to their particular
   characteristics. Therefore, even though they represent < 1\% of the
   soils worldwide, they are very important for global and local
   agriculture, as they account for > 60\% of the arable land of Chile.
   However, studies evaluating their soil quality are still scarce.
   Subsequently, soil quality indicators have not yet been established for
   Chilean volcanic soils. Hence, the aim of this study was to select a set
   of soil quality indicators to evaluate changes in Chilean volcanic
   soils, mainly due to land use, but also considering seasonal changes.
   Thus, three soils derived from volcanic materials were sampled (with
   different intrinsic properties), on five sampling dates, under three
   land uses (intensities): native forest (NF), prairie (P) and crops (C).
   Soil samples were taken to evaluate both chemical (disturbed samples)
   and physical (undisturbed cylinders and soil blocks) properties. A total
   of 27 soil properties were measured and/or calculated, among these are:
   penetration resistance, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air
   conductivity, bulk density, total porosity pore size distribution,
   aggregate stability, pH, nutrient contents, Al saturation, effective
   cation exchange capacity, soil organic carbon and extractable Al. To
   effectively select the indicators a multivariate analysis (PCA) was
   performed. The proposed set of indicators for soils derived from
   volcanic materials include: i) bulk density, ii) plant available water
   pores in volcanic soils, iii) wide coarse pores, iv) air conductivity at

Abstract = {{Organic amendments to arable soil build soil organic matter (SOM), which
   can increase crop yields. However, organic amendments can influence crop
   yields independently of SOM by providing nutrients directly to plants.
   The relative importance of native organic matter versus organic
   amendments is not well quantified. We experimentally manipulated both
   organic amendments and native SOM concentrations to quantify their
   relative importance to crop yields.
   We created OM concentration gradients by (1) diluting an organic-rich
   A-horizon with a mineral base and (2) amending compost to the same
   mineral base, generating OM concentrations for both treatments of
   approximately 2, 4 and 8\%. We grew buckwheat and measured plant
   productivity and a range of soil fertility variables.
   Higher concentrations of OM, whether native or amended, were associated
   with higher soil water holding capacity and nutrients, and improved soil
   structure. Consequently, increases in both native and amended OM were
   associated with strong positive but saturating impacts on productivity,
   though amendment effects were greater.
   Our results suggest that native SOM can support productivity levels
   comparable to those observed with organic amendments. Although our
   quantitative findings will likely vary for different soils and
   amendments, our results lend support to the idea that SOM stocks
   directly increase productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Organic matter derived from living, or recently living plant and animal,
   which can be used as fuel is called as biomass. It includes wood and
   agricultural waste such as dead plant etc. In India, majority of
   population depends largely upon agriculture as their primary source of
   income. Following every harvest, a huge amount of biomass is generated.
   It is mostly discarded as ``agro waste{''}; however, recently, several
   uses of biomass and its derivatives have been reported. Thermochemical
   processing of biomass in absence of oxygen produces biomass char and
   flue gases which are of economic importance. However, it is necessary to
   characterize the physical and chemical properties of these components so
   as to utilize their potential benefit to the fullest. In this study, six
   different biomass remains that include mustard plant, groundnut plant,
   cotton plant, wheat plant, pigeon peas, and groundnut shell were
   pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C, in vertical downdraft fixed-bed biomass
   reactor. The flue gases were characterized in detail by gas
   chromatography. X-ray fluorescence, proximate, and ultimate analyses
   were performed on all BMC (biomass char) samples, and properties such as
   porosity, particle density, bulk density, point of zero charge, surface
   pH, surface charges, water-absorption capacity, and BET surface area
   were determined. SEM and FTIR were also carried out on all BMC samples.
   Our results showed that the surface area of biomass char varies from 38
   to 138 m(2)/g. The solution pH for all BMC exceeds 8.6, thus confirmed
   the alkaline nature. Comparison between combustion products produced in
   the presence (biomass ash) and absence of oxygen (biomass char) is
   presented. BMC finds applications in agriculture, soil neutralizer,
   adsorbent, and soil additive. They have high amount of carbon and can
   act as a rich carbon source for the soil. Flue gases released contain
   methane and hydrogen which can also improve economic value for the char
   formation process.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the physical state of a clayey soil are determined by the
   soil type, soil moisture, weather conditions and tillage intensity.
   Possibilities to reduce tillage clayey soil have not been sufficiently
   investigated in Lithuania before. Research was carried out during
   2014-2016 at the Joniskelis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian
   Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry on a clay loam (siltic,
   drainic), Endocalcary-Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can) in the
   experiment, established in 2006. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the long-term effects of different tillage intensity as well as
   its combinations with supplementary agronomic practices (deep ploughing
   at 21-23 cm depth and shallow ploughless tillage at 10-12 cm depth as
   well as shallow ploughless tillage with incorporation of lime sludge and
   no-till in the autumn with a cover crop for winter mulch) on the
   indicators of soil physical state, investigated in a field pea crop.
   Ploughless tillage alone demonstrated the significantly higher soil
   water content before pre-sowing tillage in spring, higher soil dry bulk
   density, lower soil total porosity and soil water capacity before crop
   harvesting in topsoil; however, soil dry bulk density decreased, soil
   water capacity and soil total and air-filled porosity increased in the
   subsoil compared to deep ploughing. Incorporation of lime sludge
   (Ca-amendment) in the ploughless tillage plots resulted in higher soil
   water content before pre-sowing tillage, lower soil water content after
   crop emergence and before harvesting, higher air-filled porosity and
   amount of stable soil aggregates in topsoil, lower soil dry bulk
   density, higher total and air-filled porosity in subsoil before
   harvesting. Due to no-till in the autumn, with a cover crop for winter
   mulch, soil water content increased before pre-sowing tillage, it
   decreased after crop emergence and before harvesting in topsoil, soil
   dry bulk density decreased and total and air-filled porosity increased
   in subsoil; however, the amount of most agronomically valuable (0.25-5.6
   mm) soil aggregates decreased in topsoil before harvesting compared to

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of monovalent cations on clay
   dispersion, aggregate stability, soil pore size distribution, and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity on agricultural soil in Iran. The soil
   was incubated with treatment solutions containing different
   concentrations (0-54.4 mmol l(-1)) of potassium and sodium cations. The
   treatment solutions included two levels of electrical conductivity (EC=
   3 or 6 dS m(-1)) and six K: Na ratios per electrical conductivity level.
   At both electrical conductivity levels, spontaneously dispersible clay
   increased with increasing K concentration, and with increasing K: Na
   ratio. A negative linear relationship between percentage of water-stable
   aggregates and spontaneously dispersible clay was observed. Clay
   dispersion generally reduced the mean pore size, presumably due to
   clogging of pores, resulting in increased water retention. At both
   electrical conductivity levels, hydraulic conductivity increased with
   increasing exchangeable potassium percentage at low exchangeable
   potassium percentage values, but decreased with further increases in
   exchangeable potassium percentage at higher exchangeable potassium
   percentage. This is in agreement with earlier studies, but seems in
   conflict with our data showing increasing spontaneously dispersible clay

   that clay dispersion increased with increasing K concentration and

Abstract = {{Biomass as the biodegradable fraction of both agricultural products and
   industrial and municipal waste is currently a versatile energy resource.
   It can be stored and converted in practically any form of energy carrier
   and also into biochemicals and biomaterials from which, once they have
   been used, the energy content can be recovered to generate electricity,
   heat, or transport fuels. Moreover, the residues of its incineration can
   often be reused as pozzolanic additions to cement which can be
   considered as an environmentally friendly way of their disposal. In this
   paper, municipal sewage sludge with the organic carbon content of 27\%
   was used for the preparation of biomass ash that should potentially find
   use as environmentally friendly mineral admixture to construction
   binders. Based on physical and chemical characterization of the raw
   material that showed a suitable chemical and phase composition, organic
   matter in a significant amount, and no thermal decomposition processes
   above 700 A degrees C, biomass ash was produced. The biomass ash was
   obtained by incineration of sewage sludge at 700 A degrees C, and
   mechanical activation contained 52\% of amorphous phase which correlates
   with its good pozzolanic activity. The concentration of heavy metals,
   soluble chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates in biomass ash is found well
   below the standard permissible values. The composites prepared with a
   biomass ash dosage of 10, 20, and 30 wt\% of Portland cement exhibited
   good functional properties. The increase in porosity up to 6\% and
   decrease in compressive strength up to 3\% were satisfactory. The
   results of leaching tests showed that composites with biomass ash
   contain only trace amounts of chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates.
   Apparently, the chlorides contained in biomass ash (0.7 mg/g) were
   immobilized in the cement matrix because the amounts of leached
   chlorides (0.04 wt\%) were the same for all composites and well below
   the permissible limit for concrete. As revealed by the X-ray diffraction
   and thermogravimetric analyses, a significant decrease in portlandite
   content with increasing biomass ash content confirmed the pozzolanic
   reaction in biomass ash containing composite mixes. The environmental
   assessment showed a significant decrease in both carbon dioxide
   production and energy consumption with the increasing biomass ash
   content. For the composite with 30\% biomass ash dosage, it was 21\% of
   CO2 and 11\% of energy, as compared with the reference mix. The
   combination of good functional and environmental parameters of the
   analyzed composites makes good prerequisites for their application in
   construction industry. Taylor-made mineral admixture on biomass ash
   basis can find a broad use as eco-efficient admixture to cement- and
   lime-based binders.}},

   application of the parent husks or stover. These biochars improved soil
   fertility and enhanced eggplant crop growth (height, leaf number, fresh

Abstract = {{Fixed dunes are indicators of successful recovery of desertified land

Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{194-204}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has become commonplace to consider ploughing as an agricultural
   practice that destroys soil fertility. Organic farmers have
   traditionally used the plough to till their soil and control weeds.
   However, there is a growing interest in adopting tillage practices
   without ploughing to preserve long-term soil fertility and in the hope,
   subsequently, of increasing crop yields. The aim of this paper is to
   assess if conservation tillage treatments in organic farming did in fact
   improve long-term soil fertility, wheat rooting and yield in a long term
   field experiment (2004-2015). We compared the effects of conservation
   tillage treatments (superficial tillage - ST- with chisel at 15 cm depth
   and very superficial tillage - VST- at 5-7 cm depth) and conventional
   tillage treatments (traditional mouldboard ploughing- MP at 30 cm depth
   and shallow mouldboard ploughing - SMP- at 18 cm depth without skim
   coulter) during 10 years on a sandy loam soil in France. To assess soil
   fertility, physical (soil penetration resistance, visual soil profile
   observation), chemical (organic carbon - Corg, total nitrogen - Ntot and
   available phosphorus - OlsenP) and biotic (earthworms biomass, density
   and diversity) soil properties were measured in 2004-5 and 2015. The
   effect of soil fertility on wheat roots and crop growth was also
   measured in 2015. VST, and to a lesser extent ST, increased Corg, Ntot
   and OlsenP in the upper soil layer (from 0 to 15 cm) compared to
   ploughing treatments. On the contrary, soil compaction increased using
   conservation tillage treatments (VST and ST) during the 10 years of
   experiment, especially in the layers between 15 and 30 cm depth in
   comparison with ploughing treatments. This effect is not offset by an
   increase in earthworm abundance and activities in conservation
   treatments. Earthworm biomass and endogeic abundance were even higher in
   SMP compared to ST. Soil compaction limits roots, with less roots in
   depth with VST (from 12 to 30 cm and 48 to 70 cm) and ST (from 24 to 30
   cm) compared to ploughing treatments. Conservation tillage treatments
   had positive effects on soil chemical components in the upper soil layer
   and contributed to the increase of wheat biomass until tillering stage.
   However, no wheat yield difference was found between treatments.
   Physical and biotic soil properties had not significantly improved after
   10 years of conservation tillage. This could be due either to the
   insufficient duration of the experiment to foster a positive earthworm
   effect on soil porosity, or to the sandy soil, too sensitive to soil
   compaction in this organic cropping system (intensive mechanical
   weeding) and unfavourable for the development of the earthworm
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Farm ditch networks, infrastructures designed to regulate excess water
   in cropped landscapes, constitute pesticide dispersal pathways or buffer
   zones, depending on their soil properties. Despite the key role that
   ditch soils play in the regulation of water and pesticide fate, their
   properties, especially in intermittently flooded ditches, remain poorly
   characterized. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the specificity of
   ditch material properties to determine whether ditches require an
   approach that differs from that of field soils when studying water and
   pesticide fate in farmed landscapes. We thus analysed the variations in
   the pedological, herbicide sorption and flow properties of soil
   materials along a 2D cross-section of an intermittently flooded ditch in
   the Roujan catchment of southern France. We found that the upper part of
   the ditch bed soil profile is composed of 3 horizons that formed after
   the original creation of the ditch, most likely via the deposition of
   field-eroded particles and the accumulation of organic matter. These
   specific horizons have greater porosity, mostly due to their dense root
   systems, and contain up to 2 times more organic carbon than the
   neighbouring banks or field soils. Consequently, the hydraulic
   conductivity is greater, and the sorption of hydrophobic herbicides is
   up to 2 times greater in ditch bed materials than it is in soils located
   farther away from the ditch surface. Moreover, significant macroporal
   flow was evidenced in both profiles but with different contribution to
   the global flow. The contrasts in the hydrodynamic and sorption
   properties between both the ditch bed and banks materials likely results
   in significantly different water and pesticide infiltration patterns in
   ditches compared to crop fields. Given these differences, we recommend
   investigating the specific properties of ditch beds when studying and
   modelling water and pesticide fate in croplands.}},

Abstract = {{2016 was one of the warmest and driest summers on record throughout much
   of the Northeastern United States (Northeast). Additionally,
   historically low winter snowfall preceding the summer of 2016
   exacerbated drought conditions and led to record low streamflows in some
   regions. Climate models suggest that short-term summer droughts could
   increase in frequency and continue to pose challenges to farmers and
   water resource managers in the Northeast. Here we focus on the impacts
   of the drought on farmers in New York State (NY), an economically
   important agricultural state in the Northeast. We found that in several
   regions across NY 2015-16 winter snowfall, and 2016 growing season
   precipitation and streamflows were near or below the 10th percentile of
   the previous 60 years; and 2016 air temperatures were near or above the
   90th percentile of the previous 60 years. Based on survey results, more
   than 70\% of the 275 farmers surveyed across NY reported rainfed field
   crop and pasture yield losses greater than 30\%, with some loses over
   90\%. In the hardest hit Western region of NY, substantial crop losses
   (> 30\%) were reported for fruit and vegetable crops on farms with
   irrigation, due to limited irrigation equipment and water supplies (e.g.
   low streamflows, dry ponds or wells). After what they experienced in
   2016, 32\% of the 75 farmers in follow-up interviews invested in
   irrigation equipment and water sources in 2016, and 32\% said they plan
   to do so in 2017. Thirty-two percent of farmers in follow-up interviews
   said they plan to take measures to improve soil health and soil organic
   matter to improve water holding capacity and better prepare for drought.
   Model estimates suggest NY state-wide crop irrigation water use could
   increase by 3-8 times in dry years compared to average growing seasons,
   increasing seasonal usage by millions of cubic meters. This highlights
   the potential for significant increases in water withdrawals in NY, with
   implications for water resources, particularly as the climate changes.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Interest in the use of biochar in agriculture has increased
   exponentially during the past decade. Biochar, when applied to soils is
   reported to enhance soil carbon sequestration and provide other soil
   productivity benefits such as reduction of bulk density, enhancement of
   water-holding capacity and nutrient retention, stabilization of soil
   organic matter, improvement of microbial activities, and heavy-metal
   sequestration. Furthermore, biochar application could enhance phosphorus
   availability in highly weathered tropical soils. Converting the locally
   available feedstocks and farm wastes to biochar could be important under
   smallholder farming systems as well, and biochar use may have
   applications in tree nursery production and specialty-crop management.
   Thus, biochar can contribute substantially to sustainable agriculture.
   While these benefits and opportunities look attractive, several
   problems, and bottlenecks remain to be addressed before widespread
   production and use of biochar becomes popular. The current state of
   knowledge is based largely on limited small-scale studies under
   laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Properties of biochar vary with
   both the feedstock from which it is produced and the method of
   production. The availability of feedstock as well as the economic
   merits, energy needs, and environmental risks-if any-of its large-scale
   production and use remain to be investigated. Nevertheless, available
   indications suggest that biochar could play a significant role in facing
   the challenges posed by climate change and threats to agroecosystem

Abstract = {{In addition to various positive aspects, long-term reduced tillage may
   cause disadvantages such as increased weed pressure and soil compaction.
   Thus, single inversion tillage is customarily used for overcoming these
   drawbacks; however, the effects on the enhanced soil functions are
   unknown. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess
   whether improved soil physical properties following long-term reduced
   tillage remain after one-time inversion tillage by mouldboard plough.
   The study was undertaken on a silt loam field in Lower Saxony, Germany.
   Since 1996, this field has been subdivided into three treatments; one
   was managed conventionally using a mouldboard plough (CT), while on the
   others a chisel plough (RT1) and a disc harrow (RT2) were employed. In
   October 2014, the entire field was mouldboard ploughed. The following
   year, four field campaigns were conducted to compare the soil physical
   properties of the continuously conventional tilled plot with those
   affected by one-time inversion tillage (RT1 and RT2). Dry bulk density
   (DBD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and infiltration rate
   {[}K(h)] were analysed in untrafficked and trafficked areas in each
   plot. There were clear differences between CT and RT. At all sampling
   dates, both RT plots had higher Ks and K(h) compared with CT. These
   differences also occurred to some extent on the trafficked areas. This
   suggests that improved soil hydraulic properties remained after one-time
   inversion tillage of a long-term reduced tilled field. Thus, one-time
   inversion tillage may offer a suitable measure for overcoming some of
   the main disadvantages associated with long-term reduced tillage, while
   preserving the positive effects on soil physical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture wastes returning to soil is one of common ways to reuse crop
   straws in China. The returned straws are expected to improve the
   fertility and structural stability of soil during the degradation of
   straw it selves. The in situ effect of different straw (wheat, rice,
   maize, rape, and broad bean) applications for soil aggregate stability
   and soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution were studied at both dry land
   soil and paddy soil in this study. Wet sieving procedures were used to
   separate soil aggregate sizes. Aggregate stability indicators including
   mean weight diameter, geometric mean diameter, mean weight of specific
   surface area, and the fractal dimension were used to evaluate soil
   aggregate stability after the incubation of straws returning. Meanwhile,
   the variation and distribution of SOC in different-sized aggregates were
   further studied. Results showed that the application of straws,
   especially rape straw at dry land soil and rice straw at paddy soil,
   increased the fractions of macro-aggregate (> 0.25 mm) and
   micro-aggregate (0.25-0.053 mm). Suggesting the nutrients released from
   straw degradation promotes the growing of soil aggregates directly and
   indirectly. The application of different straws increased the SOC
   content at both soils and the SOC mainly distributed at < 0.53 mm
   aggregates. However, the contribution of SOC in macro- and
   micro-aggregates increased. Straw-applied paddy soil have a higher total
   SOC content but lower SOC contents at > 0.25 and 0.25-0.053 mm
   aggregates with dry land soil. Rape straw in dry land and rice straw in
   paddy field could stabilize soil aggregates and increasing SOC contents

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of conserved tills on the fluxes of
   carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil organic carbon (SOC) from a rain-fed-paddy
   plot in Assam (North-eastern state of India). Two paddy plots identical
   in soil properties, developed to cultivate rice (Sali, grown in

   conventional agricultural practice in one and conservation in the other.
   Two chambers (1 m x 0.6 m x 0.4 m) were placed in both the plots to
   collect runoff for analyzing CO2 concentrations. The results of the both
   practices have been inter-compared. For conservation plot, the SOC was
   high in the range from 3.17+0.01 kg m(-2) to 20.42 +/- 0.56 kg m(-2) and
   the CO2 emission was less, i.e. 97.30 +/- 7.11 mg m(-2) h(-1) as
   compared to 189.65 +/- 4.37 mg m-2 h-1 of the conventional plot. Low
   tillage practiced for the conservation plot facilitated higher porosity
   (50.11 +/- 8.40\% to 88.87 +/- 3.59\%) and greater water retention
   (47.47 +/- 1.15\% to 10137 +/- 1.63\%) in the soil. The results indicate
   that more tillage exposed the soil to atmospheric oxygen more, which
   leads to excess mineralization of organic carbon and emissions of CO2 as

Abstract = {{Perennial non-food energy crops are currently discussed as a more
   sustainable alternative to conventional energy crops like maize. As they
   can be cultivated on marginal soils, they reduce the risk of land use
   and food vs. fuel conflicts. In this study, we evaluated the perennial
   energy crop Sida hermaphrodita for its potential to be cultivated on
   marginal substrate and conventional agricultural soils over a three-year
   field and mesocosm experiment at agricultural conditions. Furthermore,
   we aimed for a closed nutrient loop by fertilizing plants with biogas
   digestate and using the carbon fraction of the digestate as soil
   amendment to ameliorate the overall soil fertility. As controls, plants
   were either untreated or fertilized with an equivalent amount of mineral
   NPK fertilizer. We found S. hermaphrodita to give highest DM yields of
   up to 28 t ha(-1) under favorable soil conditions when fertilized with
   mineral NPK. However, on marginal substrate digestate fertilization
   resulted in a clear biomass yield advantage over NPK fertilization. An
   increased soil carbon content, water holding capacity and basal soil
   respiration indicated improved soil fertility in the marginal substrate.
   These results demonstrate the great potential of S. hermaphrodita to be
   cultivated on marginal soil in combination with organic fertilization

Abstract = {{This study examines a surface-pore integrated mechanism that allows soil
   organic matter (SOM) to influence the retention and transport of three
   representative pharmaceuticals and personal care products
   (PPCPs)-ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and bisphenol A-in agricultural soil.
   A series of sorption-desorption batch tests and breakthrough column
   experiments were conducted using manured and non-manured soils. Results
   show that SOM could substantially influence the environmental behaviors
   of PPCPs via two mechanisms: surface-coating and pore-filling.
   Surface-coating with molecular SOM decreases the sorption of dissociated
   PPCPs (e.g., ibuprofen) but increases the sorption of non-dissociated
   PPCPs (e.g., carbamazepine and bisphenol A), while pore-filling with
   colloidal SOM enhances the retention of all the PPCPs by providing
   nano-/micro-pores that limit diffusion. The higher retention and lower
   mobility of PPCPs in soil microaggregates than in bulk soils suggest
   that SOM content and SOM-altered soil pore structure could exert a
   coupled effect on PPCP retention. Differences in the elution of PPCPs
   with low surface tension solution (i.e., 20\% ethanol) in the presence
   and absence of SOM indicate that PPCPs prefer to remain in SOM-filled
   pores. Overall, ibuprofen has a high environmental risk, whereas
   carbamazepine and bisphenol A could be readily retarded in agricultural
   soils (with a loamy clay texture). This study implies that SOM accrual
   (particularly pore-filling SOM) has a high potential for reducing the
   off-site risks of PPCPs by increasing soil nano-/micro-porosity. (C)

Abstract = {{Agriculture is a primary source of income in several countries,
   including Argentina. Among the many agrochemicals used, glyphosate-based
   herbicides raised controversy, encouraging research to clarify if the
   benefits of their use outweigh their alleged harmfulness. In this
   spirit, this study assessed soil quality indicators on
   glyphosate-sprayed fields under natural (NC) and zero tillage conditions
   (ZT) in Northwest Argentina, to analyze the effect of the herbicide
   application on soil degradation. The ZT soils underwent five years of
   continuous spraying (2-4 times a year) after land clearing, while the NC
   soil, without any laboring practices, was subjected to two consecutive
   applications. Among the measured indicators (physical, chemical, and
   biological), water-stable aggregates (WSA), particulate organic matter
   (POM) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) showed quality differences
   between ZT and NC samples. The highest values were found in NC (WSA
   72\%; POM 4.9\%; DHA 1460 mg TPF/g(soil)/d) and the lowest in ZT (WSA
   13\%; POM 1.69\%; DHA 180 mg TPF/g(soil)/d); showing a lower quality in
   ZT regarding structure stability, nutrient availability and microbial
   activity. A Discriminant Analysis revealed that as glyphosate
   application increased, the overall soil quality decreased within the NC
   samples, resembling that of ZT. Thus, soil health deterioration was
   attributed solely to glyphosate spraying in NC. Furthermore,
   multivariate analysis allowed identification of chemical indicators as
   of higher sensitivity to the short-term response after application, and
   biological indicators as more sensitive to long-term changes. The
   quality decline in time in the NC soil, caused by the use of
   glyphosate-based herbicides, could endanger the soils sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Liming represents a common agricultural practice for abating soil
   acidity. Nevertheless, elevated amounts of agricultural lime in Oxisols,
   with or without cultural residue addition, could alter soil
   physicochemical properties and impact soil structure. In this context,
   the physical, chemical, and structural behaviors of an Oxisol under the
   addition of lime and straw were assessed. Lime doses (0, 3.9, 7.8, and
   15.6 Mg ha(-1)) were either applied on the surface or incorporated into
   the 0-to 5-cm soil layer. Straw applications followed the same procedure
   with quantities of 0, 4, 12, or 16 Mg ha(-1). The effects on the soil
   profile were evaluated through physicochemical (specific surface area,.
   potential, and pH), physical (density, penetration resistance, water
   dispersible clay, and total porosity), and micromorphological properties
   (surface area, volume, connectivity, size, and pore anisotropy) 1 yr

   potential of soil colloid surface, promoting clay dispersion.
   Water-dispersed clay migrated in the soil profile, causing pore
   obstruction, and higher soil density and penetration resistance. In
   addition, excessive lime decreased specific surface area, anisotropy
   degree and the connectivity of the soil pore system. Straw addition
   promoted a slight increase of colloids electronegative potential but did

Abstract = {{Charcoal is a major component of the stable soil organic carbon
   reservoir, and the physical and chemical properties of charcoal can
   sometimes significantly alter bulk soil properties (e.g., by increasing
   soil water holding capacity). However, our understanding of the
   residence time of soil charcoal remains uncertain, with old measured
   soil charcoal ages in apparent conflict with relatively short modeled
   and measured residence times. These discrepancies may exist because the
   fate of charcoal on the landscape is a function not just of its
   resistance to biological decomposition but also its physical mobility.
   Mobility may be important in controlling charcoal landscape residence
   time and may artificially inflate estimates of its degradability, but
   few studies have examined charcoal vulnerability to physical
   redistribution. Charcoal landscape redistribution is likely higher than
   other organic carbon fractions owing to charcoal's low bulk density,
   typically less than 1.0g/cm(3). Here we examine both the physical and
   chemical properties of soil and charcoal over a period of two years
   following a 2011 wildfire in Texas. We find little change in properties
   with time; however, we find evidence of enhanced mobility of charcoal
   relative to other forms of soil organic matter. These data add to a
   growing body of evidence that charcoal is preferentially eroded,
   offering another explanation for variations observed in its
   environmental residence times.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock grazing is a global land use activity that has
   numerous social, cultural, and environmental benefits. Many marginal
   zones grazed for centuries are now suffering from abandonment, which has
   been found to be interrelated with species and functional diversity
   loss, and has potential consequences for the provision of ecosystem
   services such as soil fertility and soil carbon storage. We sampled soil
   and plant species abundance in a total of 64 plots (5 x 5 m), in wet and
   dry habitats under different grazing regimes (from moderate grazing to
   grazing abandonment for at least 30 years) in Central Spain. We tested
   the influence of grazing intensity and water availability on different
   variables related to soil fertility and also on soil carbon storage. In
   addition, Community weighted mean and Rao quadratic entropy were
   calculated for two effect traits (specific leaf area and plant height),
   in order to assess the ultimate effects of these functional attributes
   on multifunctionality (i.e., the provision of several simultaneous
   ecosystem functions). We found that grazing abandonment generally
   produces a reduction in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available
   potassium and phosphorus, aggregate stability and soil carbon storage.
   In addition, grazing abandonment had a negative effect on soil texture
   with loss of fine particles (clay and silt) and water holding capacity,
   but only in dry habitats and in longer-term abandoned situation. In
   general, soil multifunctionality was higher in wet than dry habitats,
   decreased with grazing abandonment in both habitats. Soil
   multifunctionality was indirectly mediated by the functional structure
   of size and leaf traits of the local plant communities, but our results
   suggested that macroscale grazing effects, i.e. translocation of
   nutrients by grazers among habitats via dung and urine deposition, might
   be important mechanisms that influence soil multifunctionality at the
   local level. Agri-environmental policies should be aware of the risk of
   widespread grazing abandonment and take advantage of the benefits of
   low-intensity grazing regimes for ecosystem services such as soil
   fertility and stability, and soil carbon storage.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding high-yielding rice cultivars through increasing biomass is a
   key strategy to meet rising global food demands. Yet, increasing rice
   growth can stimulate methane (CH4) emissions, exacerbating global
   climate change, as rice cultivation is a major source of this powerful
   greenhouse gas. Here, we show in a series of experiments that
   high-yielding rice cultivars actually reduce CH4 emissions from typical
   paddy soils. Averaged across 33 rice cultivars, a biomass increase of
   10\% resulted in a 10.3\% decrease in CH4 emissions in a soil with a
   high carbon (C) content. Compared to a low-yielding cultivar, a
   high-yielding cultivar significantly increased root porosity and the
   abundance of methane-consuming microorganisms, suggesting that the
   larger and more porous root systems of high-yielding cultivars
   facilitated CH4 oxidation by promoting O-2 transport to soils. Our
   results were further supported by a meta-analysis, showing that
   high-yielding rice cultivars strongly decrease CH4 emissions from paddy
   soils with high organic C contents. Based on our results, increasing
   rice biomass by 10\% could reduce annual CH4 emissions from Chinese rice
   agriculture by 7.1\%. Our findings suggest that modern rice breeding
   strategies for high-yielding cultivars can substantially mitigate paddy
   CH4 emission in China and other rice growing regions.}},

   farmers' practice (FP), high-yielding practice (BY), which maximizes
   yields without considering costs, and ISSM on the content and chemical
   composition of SOC were studied in a 4-year (2009-2013) field plot
   experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture in an Alluvic Primosol
   in Northeast China. The ISSM resulted in higher soil total organic C
   (TOC), water-soluble organic C, easily-oxidizable organic C, particulate
   organic C, and humic acid C compared with HY and FP in the region. The
   SOC contents in aggregate size fractions generally followed a similar
   pattern to TOC.,Compared with FP, HY decreased the mean weight diameter,
   geometric mean diameter, percentage of > 0.25-mm water-stable
   aggregates, and the stability ratio of water-stable aggregates, and
   increased the structure-deterioration rate and index of unstable
   aggregates. The opposite trend was observed between ISSM and HY.
   Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of bulk soil showed
   that ISSM had higher O-alkyl C and aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio, but
   lower aromatic C, carbonyl C, and alkyl C/O-alkyl C and hydrophobic
   C/hydrophilic C ratios than HY and FP. Our results suggest that ISSM
   improves the quantity and quality of SOC and has a positive effect on
   soil aggregation and aggregate stability.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar has been considered as a potential sorbent for removal of
   frequently detected pesticides in water. In the present study, modified
   and non-modified rice husk biochars were used for aqueous carbofuran
   removal. Rice husk biochars were produced at 300, 500, and 700 degrees C
   in slow pyrolysis and further exposed to steam activation. Biochars were
   physicochemically characterized using proximate, ultimate, FTIR methods
   and used to examine equilibrium and dynamic adsorption of carbofuran.
   Increasing pyrolysis temperature led to a decrease of biochar yield and
   increase of porosity, surface area, and adsorption capacities which were
   further enhanced by steam activation. Carbofuran adsorption was
   pH-dependant, and the maximum (161 mg g(-1)) occurred in the vicinity of
   pH 5, on steam-activated biochar produced at 700 degrees C. Freundlich
   model best fitted the sorption equilibrium data. Both chemisorption and
   physisorption interactions on heterogeneous adsorbent surface may
   involve in carbofuran adsorption. Langmuir kinetics could be applied to
   describe carbofuran adsorption in a fixed bed. A higher carbofuran
   volume was treated in a column bed by a steam-activated biochar versus
   non-activated biochars. Overall, steam-activated rice husk biochar can
   be highlighted as a promising low-cost sustainable material for aqueous
   carbofuran removal.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture practices have been proposed as a set of
   techniques for improving soil structure properties and related ecosystem
   services. This study compared conservation agriculture (CA) practices
   (no-tillage, cover crop and residue retention) and conventional
   intensive tillage system in order to evaluate their effects on total
   porosity, pore size distribution, pore architecture and morphology. The
   experiment was set up in 2010 on four farms of the low-lying Veneto
   Region plain characterized by silty soils. Almost hundred soil samples
   were collected in 2015 at four depths down to 50-cm layer and
   investigated for porosity from micrometre (0.0074 mu m) to macrometre
   (2.5 mm) by coupling mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray computed
   microtomography (mu CT). Indices of soil morphology and architecture
   were derived by analysing 3D images and mercury intrusion porosimetry
   pore size curves. Results suggested that silty soils of Veneto plain are
   microstructured because much (82\%) of the porosity ranged between
   0.0074 and 30 ae m. CA practices positively influenced the
   ultramicroporosity class (0.1-5 mu m) (1.86E-01 vs 1.67E-01 mu m(3) mu
   m(-3)) that is strictly linked to soil organic carbon stabilization
   while no effects were observed in X-ray mu CT porosity domain (> 26 mu
   m). Silty soils of Veneto plain showed a slow reaction to CA because of
   the poor aggregate stability and low soil organic carbon. However, the
   positive response of the ultramicropore fraction indicates that a
   virtuous cycle was initiated between soil organic carbon and porosity,
   hopefully leading to well-developed macropore systems and, in turn,
   enhanced soil functions and ecosystem services. Copyright (C) 2017 John

Abstract = {{Manure application on frozen soil, which is a common practice in the
   upper Midwest of USA, results in degraded soil and water quality. During
   snowmelt or precipitation events, water runoff carries nutrients into
   nearby streams and impairs the water quality. There is a need,
   therefore, to identify improved management of manure application in the
   soils. This study was conducted to assess water quality impacts
   associated following manure application during winter months when soil
   is completely covered with snow. The study site included three
   watersheds, named south (SW), east (CW), and north (NW) managed with a
   corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation located in South
   Dakota. The SW and NW were used as treatment, and CW as the control
   watershed. The treatments included manure application on the upper half
   of the SW and lower half of the NW, and CW received no manure
   application. This study showed that manure improved soil properties
   including infiltration rate and organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus
   losses in the surface runoff were higher from NW compared to that of SW.
   The CW had similar nutrient losses compared to the NW with slight
   differences. It can be concluded that maintaining a setback distance can
   help in improving the environmental quality as well as managing the
   agricultural wastes during the winter months.}},

Abstract = {{As a soil amendment, biochar can reduce soil bulk density, increase soil
   porosity, and alter soil aggregates and thus affect the infiltration.
   Researchers have proposed and revised several theoretical models to
   describe the process of soil infiltration. Although these models have
   been successfully used to evaluate the soil infiltration in different
   scenarios in agricultural fields, little effort has been devoted to
   assess their performances in arid and semi-arid soils after the addition
   of biochar. A laboratory experiment was performed to study the
   infiltration characteristics of two typical Loess Plateau soils at three
   particle sizes (2-1, 1-0.25, and < 0.25 mm) and five biochar application
   amounts (0, 10, 50, 100, and 150 g/kg). The performance of five models
   (i.e., the Philip model, Kostiakov model, Mezencev model, USDA-NRCS
   model, and Horton model) in simulating the infiltration process was then
   evaluated based on the adjusted coefficient of determination and a
   reduced Chi-Square test. Results indicated that the Horton model best
   simulated the water-infiltration process in an aeolian sandy soil with
   added biochar. However, the Mezencev model best simulated the
   infiltration process in a loamy clay soil (Eum-Orthic Anthrosol). The
   three-parameter model, i.e., Mezencev and Horton models can better
   describe the relationship between cumulative infiltration and
   infiltration time. In conclusion, biochar reduced the soil infiltration
   capacity of the aeolian sandy soil and increased that of the Eum-Orthic
   Anthrosol.}},

Abstract = {{Subterranean methanotrophy is a potentially important but overlooked
   sink for the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH4). This study
   documents a microbial CH4 sink in tropical subterranean karst cavities
   in Vietnam's northern karst province where porosity, steep topography,
   and scarce soil and vegetation cover foster the exchange of subterranean
   air with the atmosphere. Our data are based on (i) surveys of CH4,
   carbon dioxide, and radon concentrations in the air of 11 caves, (ii) in
   situ mesocosm experiments in caves, as well as (iii) laboratory mesocosm
   measurements using sediment and rock from caves. The extent of CH4
   depletion in cave air depends on the ventilation rate and the
   availability of moisture to provide a habitat for CH4-oxidizing
   bacteria, both of which are seasonally variable in northern Vietnam and
   in part depend on monsoonal activity. Mesocosm experiments using fresh
   versus sterilized rock and sediment confirmed the role of microbial
   methanotrophy towards uptake of CH4 from cave air. Our results also
   suggest that within-cave heterogeneity of environmental variables like
   salinity may affect rates of CH4 oxidation. We conservatively estimate
   that 150,000 metric tons of atmospheric CH4 are microbially oxidized
   annually in the similar to 29,000 km(2) of Vietnamese tropical karst,
   which would compensate for similar to 7\% of Vietnam's agricultural CH4
   emissions from rice farming and livestock. Future studies estimating the
   global fluxes of the atmospheric greenhouse gas CH4 should consider
   subterranean karst as a potentially important CH4 sink.}},

Abstract = {{The production of the main soil greenhouse gases (GHG: carbon dioxide
   {[}CO2], methane {[}CH4,] and nitrous oxide {[}N2O]) is influenced by
   agricultural practices that cause changes in soil physical, chemical,
   and biological attributes, directly affecting their emission to the
   atmosphere. The aim of this study was to investigate the infield soil
   carbon dioxide emissions (F-CO2) and soil CO2, methane, and nitrous
   oxide production potentials (P-CO2, P-CH4, and P-N2O, respectively)
   under laboratory conditions and their relationship to soil attributes in
   a mechanically harvested sugarcane area. Soil carbon dioxide emissions
   presented an infield average emission value of 1.19 mu mol CO2 m(-2)
   s(-1), while GHG production in the laboratory was 2.34 mu g C-CO2 g(-1)
   soil d(-1) and 0.20 ng N-N2O g(-1) soil d(-1) for P-CO2 and P-N2O,
   respectively. No significant production or oxidation was observed for
   CH4. Factor analysis showed the formation of two independent processes
   that explained almost 72\% of the total variance observed in the data.
   The first process was related to F-CO2 transport and its relation to
   soil physical attributes such as microporosity, macroporosity, the C/N
   ratio, soil moisture, and soil bulk density, showing the dependence
   between F-CO2 and soil porosity. The second process was related to soil
   CO2 and N2O production potentials under laboratory conditions and their
   relation to soil chemical attributes such as the sum of bases, pH, and
   available phosphorus, which affect microbial activity and contribute to
   GHG production. Although presented as independent, these processes are
   coupled and occur simultaneously in the soil, in addition to providing
   information about their variability and showing if the infield emissions
   are due to gas transport processes or soil carbon levels and their
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Arenosols in the Brazilian Cerrado are increasingly being used for
   agricultural production, particularly maize. These sandy soils are
   characterized by low soil organic matter, low available nutrients, and
   poor water-holding capacity. For this reason, adding biochar as a soil
   amendment could lead to improved water and nutrient retention. A
   greenhouse experiment was carried out using twelve biochars derived from
   four feedstocks (cotton husks, swine manure, eucalyptus sawmill residue,
   sugarcane filtercake) pyrolized at 400, 500 and 600 degrees C and
   applied at 5\% w/w. The biochars' effect on maize biomass was examined,
   along with their contribution to soil physical properties including
   water retention, electrical conductivity (EC), and grain size
   distribution. After six weeks, maize plants in soils with eucalyptus and
   particularly filtercake biochar had higher biomass compared to those in
   soils with cotton and swine manure biochars. The latter's low biomass
   was likely related to excessive salinity. In general, our biochars
   showed potential for increasing theta in sandy soils compared to the
   soil alone. Filtercake and eucalyptus biochars may improve soil aeration
   and water infiltration, while applying cotton and swine manure biochars
   at levels <5\% to avoid high salinity could contribute to improved soil
   water retention in Cerrado Arenosols.}},

Abstract = {{There is a limited understanding of solute transport properties of

   undisturbed soil columns with OM contents ranging from 11 to 86\% w/w
   under saturated steady-state conditions using tritium and bromide as
   conservative tracers. Measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) were subjected
   to model analysis using three different approaches: single-porosity
   model (SPM), mobile-immobile model (MIM), and two-flow region model
   (TFRM). The results indicated that (i) nonequilibrium solute transport
   processes are common in peat soils; (ii) the TFRM improved predictions
   of BTCs with heavy tailing or two peaks; (iii) applied tracers, tritium
   and bromide, were retarded in peat soils with higher OM content; and
   (iv) pronounced preferential flow mainly occurred in peat soils with
   lower OM content. This type of strong preferential flow had a small
   ratio of measured to fitted pore water velocity and a greater ratio of
   velocities (v(A)/v(B) > 3.0) in the fast and slow transport region as
   obtained from the TFRM. We conclude that shallow groundwater resources
   are more likely to become polluted in drained and degraded fen peats

Abstract = {{Soil air exchange is one of the most important soil functions that
   directly impacts on crop productivity and environment. Generally,
   conservation agriculture (CA) practices are expected to provide improved
   soil aeration but contrasting texture-related effects were found in the
   literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CA
   practices on gas transport characteristics in the silty soils of the
   Veneto Region (North-Eastern Italy). In 2010, a field experiment
   comparing CA practices (no-tillage, cover crop and residues retention)
   to conventional intensive tillage (IT) system was established in four
   farms located in the Veneto low plain. In fall 2015, 144 undisturbed 100
   cm(3) soil cores where collected at two different layers (3-6.5 cm and
   20-23.5 cm) and analysed for air-filled porosity, air permeability, gas
   diffusivity and soil structure indices derived.
   Gas transport measurements highlighted low transmission properties of
   the silty soils independently from agronomic management. Both air
   permeability and relative gas diffusivity showed poor aerated conditions
   being generally < 20 mu m(2) and < 0.005, respectively.
   CA treatments affected the transmission properties only in the coarsest
   soil studied causing a reduction of air permeability in the deeper layer
   and relative gas diffusivity in both layers. The CA-induced reduction
   was related to the tillage effect on soil bulk density and suggested
   that CA not only affected the air-filled porosity but also continuity
   and tortuosity characteristics.
   The poor structural stability of Veneto soils, particularly the poor
   soil organic carbon content, could prevent the exploitation of CA
   practices firstly on soil structure and in turn on gas exchanges. For
   these reasons further studies elucidating the mechanisms improving soil
   structural conditions for silty soils as those examined in this study
   are required.}},

   stability, and bulk density) and 22 rainfall simulations were carried
   out under dry conditions. During the experiments, local inclination,

Abstract = {{This research was focused on the valorization of agro industrial
   waste/by products available in the local industry with the kilometer
   zero (km 0) concept, as a replacement of virgin raw materials (clay) to
   elaborate lightweight aggregates (LWAS). The alternative raw materials
   were employed as pore forming agent, in order to reduce sintering
   temperature and energy consumption of the furnace. The three technical
   nutrients studied were provided for local food industries: sludge from
   wastewater treatment plant from brewery industry (SB), meat-bone meal
   (MBM) and corn cob (CC). These materials were characterized in terms of
   chemical (XRF and elemental analysis - CHNS) and mineralogical (XRD)
   composition, as well as their thermal behavior (TGA/DTA/DSC) and LOI.
   For the production of LWAS different percentage of waste/by product (0,
   5, 10 and 15\%) were mixed with three types of clays (white, black and
   red) in two different clay-based mixtures. With the addition of water
   were produced approximately spherical pellets and thermal treated at two
   different temperatures (900 and 1000 degrees C) for 1 hour.
   Technological parameters such as bulk and absolute density, total
   porosity, water absorption capacity, pH, electrical conductivity and
   organic matter content were measured, to determine their potential use
   in agriculture. XRD and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were
   performed for the characterization of different samples.
   The results indicate the potential for manufacturing high quality
   lightweight aggregates for agronomic purposes, using relatively simple
   processing and low sintering temperature that contribute to the
   reduction of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic growth and consequent land-use changes are considered one of
   the main factors causing inundations in many cities in developing
   countries. During the last decade, the city of Colima, Mexico, has
   suffered from an increase in flooding events. These episodes mostly
   occurred during tropical rainstorms associated to hurricanes (such as
   Jova in 2011, Manuel in 2013, and Patricia in 2015, all with average
   accumulated rainfall of 200 mm in 24 h), as well as during
   short-duration, high-intensity rainfall events at the beginning of the
   rainy season. To define the mechanisms leading to the increased
   occurrence of floodings, a space-time analysis of land-use changes,
   coupled with the characterization of natural and urban soils, are
   presented here for the Colima metropolitan area. Three land-use
   categories were created: native land (N1), urban land (N4), and
   cultivated land (N5). Each of these categories has subcategories
   depending on vegetative cover and/or level of urbanization. SPOT imagery
   acquired in 2005, 2009, and 2015 was classified to analyze the spatial
   and temporal changes in land use. Thirty-two soil samples representative
   of different land uses were analyzed to obtain their physical and
   chemical properties such as granulometry, bulk and particle densities,
   porosity, and organic matter content. Hydraulic conductivity tests were
   performed in situ using a drip-infiltrometer device.
   The temporal and spatial analysis of SPOT images revealed that most
   changes in land use correspond to urban area and cultivated land, the
   former showing an increase and the latter a drastic decrease, especially
   towards the northern part of the city, where urban growth is evident for
   the 2005-2009 period. Analyzed soils from cultivated land have the
   highest permeability, and engineered soils correspond to the least
   permeable soils in the area; consequently, replacement of agriculture
   with housing has significant impacts on the rainfall-runoff process.
   These results indicate that as more permeable land area is substituted
   by disturbed urban soils, the infiltration capability will be reduced,
   leading to increasing flooding frequency in the Colima-Villa de Alvarez
   metropolitan area. To prevent and reduce the disruptive impact of
   inundation in the Colima metropolitan area, it is recommended to have
   adequate management of land-use change and to conserve the permeable
   areas around the city. In addition, it is necessary to revise the
   hydraulic infrastructure of the existing urban areas and to properly
   define the most suitable locations for future ones. Avoiding development
   in flood-prone areas through planning and zoning ordinances may reduce
   loss of life and damage to property.}},

Abstract = {{Soil resources are prone to degradation in harsh hill environment.
   Conservation tillage and residue mulching play an important role in
   protecting and improving soil quality. A 4-year study was conducted in
   Meghalaya, India, involving maize (Zea mays L.)-rapeseed (Brassica
   campestris L.) cropping system, to evaluate the impact of no till (NT)
   and mulching on productivity of maize-rapeseed system and to assess the
   effect of management on soil organic carbon (SOC) and quality. Two
   tillage practices, conventional tillage (CT) and NT, were compared under
   six mulching rates: control (no mulching); M, maize stover retention;
   MA5, M + ragweed (RW; Ambrosia artemisiifolia) 5 Mg ha(-1); MA10, M + RW
   10 Mg ha(-1); MF10, M + farmyard manure 10 Mg ha(-1); and MA5P5, M + RW
   5 Mg ha(-1) + poultry manure 5 Mg ha(-1). Grain yields of maize and
   rapeseed under CT were similar to those under NT. Mulching had a
   significant effect on the productivity of maize and rapeseed. Mulching
   treatment MA5P5, MF10 and MA10 produced significantly (p = 0.05) higher
   yield of maize and rapeseed than that of other treatments. Maize and
   rapeseed productivity under control was the lowest. There was a marked
   increase in SOC concentration (8.4\%), water stable aggregates (9.3\%),
   mean weight diameter (42.6\%) and soil microbial biomass carbon (66.8\%)
   under NT, with respect to CT. Mulching treatment MA5P5 enhanced mean SOC
   concentration by 30.4\% and mean weight diameter by 100\% compared with
   those under control. Thus, NT and mulching are recommended measures for
   protecting soil and improving its quality in the studied area. Copyright

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to characterize soil hydrophobicity,
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity under different land
   uses (i.e croplands, plantation agriculture and natural forests) and
   soil types in southwestern Nigeria. In this study, a total of 105
   different points in 35 different locations comprising of the 3 land uses
   were sampled in the study areas. Random sampling pattern of 3 sampling
   points per sample location were carried out and undisturbed soil samples
   were collected at depths up to 15 cm from the different locations.
   Handheld mini disk infiltrometer at a steady-state flow of 2 cm water
   suction rate was used to determine the unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity, water and ethanol sorptivity at each land use site. In
   addition, the effects of antecedent soil moisture contents (MC), soil
   bulk density (BD), total porosity (FT), soil water holding capacity
   (WHC), organic matter content (SOM), and cation exchange capacity (CEC)
   on soil hydrophobicity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and
   sorptivity were determined. The mean hydrophobicity index, R, showed a
   decreasing trend in the order: natural forest (>) plantation
   agriculture(>) croplands, whereas, mean hydraulic conductivity values
   showed an increasing trend in the order: natural forest < plantation
   agriculture < croplands. Hydraulic conductivity resulted to a negative
   correlation with hydrophobicity among all sampled soils. In all the
   sampled soils, index of soil hydrophobicity (R) correlated significantly
   (p <= 0.01) with organic matter content, organic carbon and cation
   exchange capacity (CEC). Soil sorptivity to water correlated negatively
   with moisture content among all samples at p <= 0.05. Soil ethanol
   sorptivity showed significantly positive correlation with organic
   carbon, organic matter content and cation exchange capacity among all
   the soil samples at a p <= 0.05. Soil properties such as organic matter
   content, bulk density, and aggregate sizes influence the infiltration
   characteristics of soils of the study areas. Findings from this research
   has provided a better understanding of soil characteristics and water
   management under different land uses, which will be of utmost usefulness
   to land managers, growers, hydrologist and soil scientists. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{No-tillage has become a universal management system to conserve soil
   water and sustain soil productivity in dryland agriculture. However,
   no-tillage in a long-term may produce some undesirable soil
   characteristics. An occasional tillage operation has been used as a mean
   to manage some of the defects that have emerged in NT farming systems.
   This study was to explore the effect of sub-soiling at different
   frequencies in a no-tillage farming system of an annual cropping system
   of winter wheat-spring maize rotation on Loess Plateau. The study
   consisted of three tillage practices: NT (no-tillage were applied every
   year), NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first year and rotated with
   sub-soiling in second year), NT/NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first
   two year and rotated with sub-soiling in third year). The study began in
   2007 on a former spring maize field with conventional tillage and lasted
   for three-year rotation cycles by 2016. In ten years, for the soil
   physical properties, NT/ST rotation significantly decreased soil bulk
   density, and increased soil porosity and amount of macroaggregates ( >
   0.25 mm) when compared to NT (P < 0.05). For water storage, NT with ST
   rotations (NT/ST \&NT/NT/ST) increased the soil water storage in the
   fallow periods. Moreover, NT/ST rotation produced higher average grain
   yields, WUE and economic profit in the winter wheat-spring maize
   cropping system when compared to NT over the ten years. However, the
   soil organic matter (SOM) and total N under NT with ST rotations (NT/ST
   \& NT/NT/ ST) were lower than it for NT. For this long-term experiment,
   NT provided a better soil nutrient condition, NT/ NT/ST and NT/ST
   rotation showed a better effect on soil water storage in fallow. For the
   comprehensive productivity, NT/ST rotation showed a balanced soil
   properties and crop production effect among three tillage treatments. In
   the winter wheat-spring maize cropping system, NT/ST rotation enhanced
   soil physical and chemical properties and increased yield and water
   holding capacity of soil. We predict that the NT/ST rotation will be of
   great significance in promoting the development of rain-fed conservation
   farming in the Loess Plateau of China.}},

Abstract = {{Organic waste fertilizers have previously been observed to significantly
   affect soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil structure. However,
   the effect of organic waste fertilizers on colloid dispersibility and
   leaching of colloids from topsoil has not yet been studied extensively.
   We investigated how the repeated application of different types of
   agricultural (liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure) and urban
   waste fertilizers (sewage sludge and composted organic household waste)
   affected soil physical properties, colloid dispersion from aggregates,
   tracer transport, and colloid leaching from intact soil cores. Total
   porosity was positively correlated with SOC content. Yearly applications
   of sewage sludge increased absolute microporosity (pores <30 mu m) and
   decreased relative macroporosity (pores >30 mu m) compared with the
   unfertilized control, whereas organic household waste compost
   fertilization increased both total porosity and the absolute porosity in
   all pore size classes (though not significant for 100-600 mu m).
   Treatments receiving large amounts of organic fertilizers exhibited
   significantly lower levels of dispersible colloids compared with an
   unfertilized control and a treatment that had received moderate
   applications of cattle slurry. The content of water-dispersible colloids
   could not be explained by a single factor, but differences in SOC
   content, electrical conductivity, and sodium adsorption ratio were
   important factors. Moreover, we found that the fertilizer treatments did
   not significantly affect the solute transport properties of the topsoil.
   Finally, we found that the leaching of soil colloids was significantly
   decreased in treatments that had received large amounts of organic waste
   fertilizers, and we ascribe this primarily to treatment-induced
   differences in effluent electrical conductivity during leaching.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of applications of pig slurry on soil aggregate stability are

   identify aggregate stability tests that give a reliable description of
   the soil's behaviour when pig slurry (PS) is applied to calcareous soil
   and (ii) interpret them in terms of chemical, biological, morphological
   and physical soil properties for soil quality assessments. Soil samples
   from eight fertilizer treatments (mineral fertilizers and PS), applied
   over seven growing seasons were analysed. We applied five methodologies
   to examine different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown. Porosity was
   characterized by image analyses. There was minimum resistance to the
   mechanical breakdown of aggregates when slurries had been applied 12
   months before analysis. Recent applications of slurry (3 months before
   the analysis) improved resistance to implosion caused by the penetration
   of water into dry aggregates (slaking), although the opposite result can
   occur if the method of evaluation is not chosen properly. Recent
   applications of PS also enhanced soil respiration and increased soil
   porosity in the 25-100-mu m size range (packing pores between
   aggregates) and in the 100-400-mu m size range (interaggregate or faunal
   pores). In dryland systems and in the winter cereal cropping season, the

Abstract = {{Many environmental and agricultural applications involve the transport
   of water and dissolved constituents through aggregated soil profiles, or
   porous media that are structured, fractured or macroporous in other
   ways. During the past several decades, various process-based macroscopic
   models have been used to simulate contaminant transport in such media.
   Many of these models consider advectivedispersive transport through
   relatively large inter-aggregate pore domains, while exchange with the
   smaller intra-aggregate pores is assumed to be controlled by diffusion.
   Exchange of solute between the two domains is often represented using a
   first-order mass transfer coefficient, which is commonly obtained by
   fitting to observed data. This study aims to understand and quantify the
   solute exchange term by applying a dual-porosity pore-scale network
   model to relatively large domains, and analysing the pore scale results
   in terms of the classical dual-porosity (mobile-immobile) transport
   formulation.
   We examined the effects of key parameters (notably aggregate porosity
   and aggregate permeability) on the main dual-porosity model parameters,
   i.e., the mobile water fraction (O.) and the mass transfer coefficient
   (a). Results were obtained for a wide range of aggregate porosities
   (between 0.082 and 0.700). The effect of aggregate permeability was
   explored by varying pore throat sizes within the aggregates. Solute
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained with the pore-scale network model at
   several locations along the domain were analysed using analytical
   solutions of the dual-porosity model to obtain estimates of Om and a. An
   increase in aggregate porosity was found to decrease cp,,, and increase
   a, leading to considerable tailing in the BTCs. Changes in the aggregate
   pore throat size affected the relative flow velocity between the intra-
   and inter-aggregate domains. Higher flow velocities within the
   aggregates caused a change in the transport regime from diffusion
   dominated to more advection dominated. This change increased the
   exchange rate of solutes between the mobile and immobile domains, with a
   related increase in the value of the mass transfer coefficient and less
   tailing in the BTCs. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In European Union countries, disposal sewage sludge on agricultural
   lands is restricted by directives. Large-area degradation of surface
   soils in Europe is a major challenge to maintain and remediate due to
   their size and geomorphology, different historical uses and current
   biogeochemical conditions. These sites are often degraded with a mixture
   of contaminants mostly lacking a biologically active topsoil. The use of
   sewage sludge to restore such sites with soil organic matter and stabile
   plant cover have for long been explored, but the application is
   restricted by the chemical quality of the sewage sludge. Hence we
   designed a study to investigate the effect of a one-time amendment of a
   low-metal contaminated sewage sludge on a barren and contaminated soil
   to immobilize harmful trace metals and obtain sustainable plant cover.
   The present study was aimed to create plant cover on a barren soil by a
   single application of sewage sludge through the process of
   phytostabilization. The field experiment was conducted in the
   contaminated area near a zinc smelter with high metal concentration
   (cadmium, zinc, lead) and poor soil fertility. A single application of
   sewage sludge from food industry was made and forest species of Scots
   pine (Pinus silvestris L), Norway spruce (Picea abies L) and oak
   (Quercus robur L) were used for phytoremediation. It was found that
   single application of sewage sludge was beneficial for development of
   plant cover and after a five years a significant increase in the biomass
   of trees (mainly spruce and pine) was achieved. Moreover, in the amended
   plots, the growth of various species of grasses, dicotyledonous plants,
   and spontaneous growth of birch was also observed. On control plots with
   no sewage sludge application, the planted trees gradually withered away
   during the same period. Sewage sludge from food industry provided plant
   nutrients effectively utilized by the plants. Its application also
   increased the water holding capacity in the test plots due to it
   contribution to soil organic matter. Compared to the control plots, the
   content of macroelements and carbon in soil was still higher at the end
   of the 5 year study. The high content of bioavailable macroelements in
   sewage sludge, poses a potential threat to their leaching and run-off
   into groundwater, contributing to the emergence of eutrophication of
   water bodies. However, the results of the experiments showed that the
   gradual release of macronutrients from sewage sludge were fully used by
   plants to stimulate their growth and development. The content of
   cadmium, zinc and lead in plant biomass was much lower compared to
   untreated plants. Also for treated plants the heavy metals were mainly
   accumulated in roots. The data from this field trial provided results
   supporting the use of high quality sewage sludge amendment for
   remediation of contaminated and barren soils, and large scale trials
   should be followed up on various degraded soil types. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Organic soils are the most important source of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) in surface water. To date, most studies have focused on natural
   and re -wetted peatlands, but in Central Europe a large proportion of
   organic soils are drained and under agricultural use. Furthermore,
   measures such as deep ploughing or sand addition have been conducted to
   improve trafficability and have resulted in topsoil horizons consisting
   of a peat -sand mixture. Very little is known about DOC losses{''} from
   such soils. Moreover, peat soils frequently feature both mobile zones,
   characterised by active water and solute transport, and immobile zones,
   which.exchange solutes with the mobile zone by diffusion. Surprisingly,
   however, the effects of this dual porosity on DOC transport have not yet
   been explored. This study investigated the physicochemical controls on
   DOC concentrations in a peat -sand mixture by means of a saturated
   column experiment with undisturbed columns. The soil came from a former
   bog in northern Germany where peat layers remaining after peat
   extraction were mixed with the underlying mineral soil by ploughing.
   Three pumping rates and two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) were
   applied. The transport properties of the soil were obtained by analysing
   breakthrough curves of potassium bromide using the transport model
   STANMOD, which is based on the two -region non -equilibrium concept. The
   results of the column study were compared to DOC concentrations measured
   bi-weekly for two years at the field site from where the columns were
   taken. Despite a similar texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content,
   the fraction of the mobile zone in the columns varied between 51\% and
   100\% of total porosity. Thus even heavily degraded organic soils mixed
   with sand still showed a dual porosity comparable to degraded peat
   soils. Percolating the columns with the high EC solution caused low pH
   values, probably due to ion exchange and cation bridging. The
   combination of high EC and low pH greatly decreased DOC concentrations
   at the outlet of the columns. DOC concentrations decreased and fluxes
   increased as the pumping rates increased. Taking pore water velocity in
   the mobile zone into account could help to explain the differences
   between the columns. Overall, transport of DOC did not seem to be
   limited by production of DOC, but by rate -limited exchange processes.
   In contrast to the column experiment, field concentrations of DOC were
   much higher and were not related to pH, but increased with higher
   electrical conductivity. These higher concentrations could be explained
   by low pore water velocities and the slightly higher SOC content in the
   field. This first experiment on DOC transport in peat -sand mixtures
   taking the dual -porosity nature of organic soils into account clearly
   demonstrated the importance of pore water velocity and thus the
   residence time for DOC concentrations. While hydrochemical conditions
   are frequently addressed in laboratory studies, there is a need for
   improved understanding of their interaction with hydrology and soil
   physical properties, especially when attempting to interpret DOC data on
   different spatial and temporal scales.(C) 2017 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{Cotton is the major fiber crop in Pakistan that accounts for 2\% of
   total national gross domestic product (GDP). After picking of cotton,
   the dry stalks are major organic waste that has no fate except burning
   to cook food in villages. Present research focuses use of cotton stalks
   as feedstock for biochar production, its characterization and effects on
   soil characteristics. Dry cotton stalks collected from agricultural
   field of Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan were combusted
   under anaerobic conditions at 450 degrees C. The physicochemical
   analysis of biochar and cotton stalks show higher values of \% total
   carbon, phosphorus and potassium concentrations in biochar as compared
   to cotton stalks. The concentration of nitrogen was decreased in
   biochar. Similarly biochar had greater values of fixed carbon that
   suggest its role for carbon sequestration and as a soil amendment. The
   fourier transformation infrared spectroscopic spectra (FTIR) of cotton
   stalks and biochar exposed more acidic groups in biochar as compared to
   cotton stalks. The newly developed functional groups in biochar have
   vital role in increasing surface properties, cation exchange capacity,
   and water holding capacity, and are responsible for heavy metal
   remediation in contaminated soil. In a further test, results show
   increase in the water holding capacity and nutrient retention by a sandy

Abstract = {{Landfill stabilized waste (LSW) is the aged municipal solid waste mined
   from old landfills. It is a soil-like material containing high value of
   organic matter and nutrients and thus may be used as topsoil substitute.
   To evaluate the potential harmful effects, LSW was sampled from five
   landfills around Beijing, China. The concentration of 150 semi-volatile
   organic compounds (SVOCs), total soluble salt, cation exchange capacity
   (CEC) and the distribution of water-stable aggregate size fractions were
   determined. According to the results, 14 SVOCs were detected in LSW,
   including phenol, cresol, 9 PAHs, 2 PAEs and 1 OCP. The concentrations
   of all detected SVOCs were below the critical limits for soil quality
   published by Chinese authority, but further studies are needed when it
   is applied in areas for residential use. The total soluble salt content
   of LSW ranged from 2.9 to 7.6 g kg(-1), and CEC ranged from 3.13 to 6.06
   cmol kg(-1), indicating that LSW had a high level of salinity but a poor
   ability of holding and releasing positive-charged elements by clay
   minerals and humus colloids. Compared to agricultural soil (sandy clay),
   LSW had more and larger water-stable aggregates, and generally, plants
   grew better in LSW. LSW of 7-10 mm in size was best for plant growth.
   The results confirm LSW as a promising topsoil substitute which can be
   used in afforestation.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional agricultural practices that use excessive chemical
   fertilizers and pesticides come at a great price with respect to soil
   health, a key component to achieve agricultural sustainability. Organic
   farming could serve as an alternative agricultural system and solve the
   problems associated with the usage of agro-chemicals by sustainable use
   of soil resources. A study was carried out to evaluate the impact of
   organic vs. conventional cultivations of basmati rice on soil health
   during Kharif (rainy) season of 2011 at Kaithal district of Haryana,
   India, under farmers' participatory mode. Long-term application of
   organic residues in certified organic farms was found to improve
   physical, chemical, and biological indicators of soil health. Greater
   organic matter buildup as indicated by higher soil organic carbon
   content in organic fields was critical to increase soil aggregate
   stability by increasing water holding capacity and reducing bulk
   density. Proper supplementation of nutrients (both major and micro
   nutrients) through organic residue addition favored biologically
   available nutrients in organic systems. Further, the prevalence of
   organic substrates stimulated soil microorganisms to produce enzymes
   responsible for the conversion of unavailable nutrients to plant
   available forms. Most importantly, a closer look at the relationship
   between physicochemical and biological indicators of soil health
   evidenced the significance of organic matter to enzyme activities
   suggesting enhanced nutrient cycling in systems receiving organic
   amendments. Enzyme activities were very sensitive to short-term (one
   growing season) effects of organic vs. conventional nutrient management.
   Soil chemical indicators (organic matter and nutrient contents) were
   also changed in the short-term, but the response was secondary to the
   biochemical indicators. Taken together, this study indicates that
   organic farming practices foster biotic and abiotic interactions in the
   soil which may facilitate in moving towards a sustainable food future.}},

   three types of crop residues for immobilizing Pb and As and their
   effects on the abundance of microbial community in contaminated lowland
   paddy (P-soil) and upland (U-soil) agricultural soils. Biochars were
   produced from umbrella tree {[}Maesopsis eminii] wood bark {[}WB],

   pyrolysis at a heating rate of 10 degrees C min(-1). Soils were

   holding capacity for 45 d. The biochar effects on metal immobilization
   were evaluated by sequential extraction of the treated soil, and the
   microbial community was determined by microbial fatty acid profiles and
   dehydrogenase activity. The addition of WB caused the largest decrease
   in Pb in the exchangeable fraction (P-soil: 77.7\%, U-soil: 91.5\%),
   followed by CP (P-soil: 67.1\%, U-soil: 81.1\%) and PKS (P-soil: 9.1\%,
   U-soil: 20.0\%) compared to that by the control. In contrast, the
   additions of WB and CP increased the exchangeable As in U-soil by 84.6\%
   and 14.8\%, respectively. Alkalinity and high phosphorous content of
   biochars might be attributed to the Pb immobilization and As
   mobilization, respectively. The silicon content in biochars is also an
   influencing factor in increasing the As mobility. However, no
   considerable effects of biochars on the microbial community abundance

Abstract = {{According to many evidences, in Argentina, no-tillage (NT) coupled with
   soybean monoculture leads to adverse soil structure features. While some
   farmers have simplified the production system through soybean
   monoculture others have intensified the land-use by increasing the
   number and diversity in the crop sequence. The effects of this
   intensification, in terms of soil structural quality, are contradictory,
   possibly caused by the increase of machinery traffic. In order to assess
   soil structural quality and the performance of selected
   morpho-structural variables with different levels of intensification, we
   analyzed plots under NT with high and low crop sequence intensification
   (Good -GAP- and Poor -PAP-, agricultural practices respectively) and
   reference plots in four soils (two Argiudolls, an Haplustoll and an
   Hapludert) of the Argentinian Pampean region. The morpho-structural
   variables assessed were Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure at field
   scale (VESS), visible porosity (Vp), roundness (Rd), eccentricity (Ecc)
   and 3-D aggregate features (faces, corners and edges). Plots with higher
   frequency of cereals in the sequence (GAP) presented on average higher
   VESS scores, higher Vp values and less rounded aggregates with more
   faces and corners, suggesting that crop sequence intensification induces
   favorable structural features. VESS, Vp, number of faces and corners
   were strongly correlated with aggregate stability tests mainly with the
   fast and fast(10s) test (r: -0.56, -0.74; 0.48, 0.52; 0.46, 0.49 and
   0.42, 0.50, respectively) and with the more labile organic carbon

   0.43, respectively). These observations suggest that the variables
   examined, concerning aggregates and pores were sensitive to changes in
   crop sequence and are useful soil quality indicators. However, the
   occurrence of platy structures also under GAP shows the need to adjust
   the VESS method to the NT system. Besides, the effect of agricultural
   intensification on soil morphology was modulated by soil type. In
   consequence, this last factor has also to be considered for the
   definition of a quality indicator to track the effect of crop sequences

Abstract = {{Macro-aggregates especially in agricultural steppe soils are supposed to
   play a vital role for soil organic carbon (OC) stabilization at a
   decadal timescale. While most research on soil OC stabilization in
   steppes focused on North American prairie soils of the Great Plains with
   information mainly provided by short-term incubation experiments, little
   is known about the agricultural steppes in southwestern Siberia, though
   they belong to the greatest conversion areas in the world and occupy an
   area larger than that in the Great Plains. To quantify the proportion of
   macro-aggregate-protected OC under different land use as function of
   land use intensity and time since land use change (LUC) from pasture to
   arable land in Siberian steppe soils, we determined OC mineralization
   rates of intact (250-2000 mu m) and crushed (<250 mu m) macro-aggregates
   in long-term incubations over 401 days (20 degrees C; 60\% water holding
   capacity) along two agricultural chronosequences in the Siberian Kulunda
   steppe. Additionally, we incubated bulk soil (<2000 mu m) to determine
   the effect of LUC and subsequent agricultural use on a fast and a slow
   soil OC pool (labile vs. more stable OC), as derived from fitting
   exponential-decay models to incubation data. We hypothesized that (i)
   macro-aggregate crushing leads to increased OC mineralization due to an
   increasing microbial accessibility of a previously occluded labile
   macroaggregate OC fraction, and (ii) bulk soil OC mineralization rates
   and the size of the fast OC pool are higher in pasture than in arable
   soils with decreasing bulk soil OC mineralization rates and size of the
   fast OC pool as land use intensity and time since LUC increase. Against
   our hypothesis, OC mineralization rates of crushed macro-aggregates were
   similar to those of intact macro-aggregates under all land use regimes.
   Macro-aggregate-protected OC was almost absent and accounted for <1\% of
   the total macro-aggregate OC content and to a maximum of 8 +/- 4\% of
   mineralized OC. In accordance to our second hypothesis, highest bulk
   soil OC mineralization rates and sizes of the fast OC pool were
   determined under pasture, but mineralization rates and pool sizes were
   unaffected by land use intensity and time since LUC. However, at one
   chronosequence mean residence times of the fast and slow OC pool tended
   to decrease with increasing time since establishment of arable use. We
   conclude that the tillage-induced breakdown of macro-aggregates has not
   reduced the OC contents in the soils under study. The decline of OC
   after LUC is probably attributed to the faster soil OC turnover under
   arable land as compared to pasture at a reduced plant residue input.}},

   Positively and Negatively to Ecosystem Services in Wheat Agro-Ecosystems}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important and manageable property of
   soils that impacts on multiple ecosystem services through its effect on
   soil processes such as nitrogen (N) cycling and soil physical
   properties. There is considerable interest in increasing SOC
   concentration in agro-ecosystems worldwide. In some agro-ecosystems,
   increased SOC has been found to enhance the provision of ecosystem
   services such as the provision of food. However, increased SOC may
   increase the environmental footprint of some agro-ecosystems, for
   example by increasing nitrous oxide emissions. Given this uncertainty,
   progress is needed in quantifying the impact of increased SOC
   concentration on agro-ecosystems. Increased SOC concentration affects
   both N cycling and soil physical properties (i.e., water holding
   capacity). Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the contribution,
   both positive and negative, of increased SOC concentration on ecosystem
   services provided by wheat agro-ecosystems. We used the Agricultural
   Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to represent the effect of
   increased SOC concentration on N cycling and soil physical properties,
   and used model outputs as proxies for multiple ecosystem services from
   wheat production agro-ecosystems at seven locations around the world.
   Under increased SOC, we found that N cycling had a larger effect on a
   range of ecosystem services (food provision, filtering of N, and nitrous
   oxide regulation) than soil physical properties. We predicted that food
   provision in these agro-ecosystems could be significantly increased by
   increased SOC concentration when N supply is limiting. Conversely, we
   predicted no significant benefit to food production from increasing SOC
   when soil N supply (from fertiliser and soil N stocks) is not limiting.
   The effect of increasing SOC on N cycling also led to significantly
   higher nitrous oxide emissions, although the relative increase was
   small. We also found that N losses via deep drainage were minimally
   affected by increased SOC in the dryland agro-ecosystems studied, but
   increased in the irrigated agro-ecosystem. Therefore, we show that under
   increased SOC concentration, N cycling contributes both positively and
   negatively to ecosystem services depending on supply, while the effects
   on soil physical properties are negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture in the temperate zone of the Midwestern USA has removed most
   riparian buffer zones from the landscape, which impairs the soil
   functioning of the soil in these ecosystems. The objective of this study
   was to assess soil degradation in a non-buffered riparian zone with an
   annual row crop (ARC) and in a longer established (more than 85 years)
   riparian cool season grass (CSG) buffer in central Iowa, USA. To achieve
   our objective, we compared the functioning of the target system, ARC,
   with a system that has been undisturbed since 1990, CSG. We measured the
   aggregate size distribution and stability of macroaggregrates,
   aggregate-associated soil organic carbon and particulate organic matter
   (POM). The categorization of aggregates by size and water stability
   (slaking resistance) showed a significantly larger (P<0.05) proportion
   of water-stable macroaggregates (> 250 mu m) under CSG (53\%) than under
   ARC (26.3\%). On the other hand, soil under ARC had the larger
   proportion of large and small water-unstablemacroaggregates. The results
   indicate that the concentration of organic C associated with the total
   water-stable aggregates is 1.9 times greater under CSG (23.9 mgC g(-1))
   than for the ARC (12.4 mgC g(-1)). The concentration of carbon in light
   particulate organic matter (LPOM-C) under CSG accounted for 12\% of
   total soil organic carbon (TSOC), but only 6\% under ARC management. The
   chemical composition of LPOM in the ARC soil had a large alkyl-C/O-alkyl
   C ratio, which suggests more organic matter decomposition than with the
   CSG. Electronic micrographs showed evidence that under CSG roots and
   fungal hyphae form an extensive network around the large macroaggregates
   (> 2000 mu m), and thus maintain the stability of the macroaggregates.
   Preserving the CSG buffer reduces soil erosion and the processes
   associated with nonpoint source pollutants, which improves water quality
   in an intensively managed agricultural system.}},

Abstract = {{Soil aggregation is one of the key properties affecting the productivity

   aggregates were measured using both wet and dry sieving methods. Results
   showed that applying biochar significantly decreased the percentage of
   aggregate destruction and soil fractal dimension and increased the MWD
   and GMD. The optimal amelioration was observed when biochar was applied
   at a rate of 40 t ha(-1). The decline of the fractal dimension of dry
   aggregates was 2-9 times as much as that of water-stable aggregates in
   the 0-15 soil layer and 1-4 times in the 15-30 cm soil layer. These

Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) plays an important role in terrestrial carbon storage.
   Nevertheless, the effect of cultivation on long term dynamics of BC in
   soil has been poorly addressed. To fill this gap, we studied the
   chemical properties of charcoal particles extracted from preindustrial
   kilns in Wallonia, Belgium, along a chronosequence of land use change
   from forest to agricultural soil, up to 200 years of cultivation.
   Preindustrial charcoal samples were compared with charcoal subjected to
   short term ageing in a currently active kiln.
   Cultivation increased the association of charcoal with soil minerals,
   which is favored by deprotonation of carboxylic acids under liming,
   thereby enhancing the reactivity of charcoal toward mineral surfaces.
   The large specific surface area of charcoal, related to its porosity,
   promotes the precipitation of 2:1 phyllosilicates and CaCO3. Both ageing
   and cultivation decreased the resistance of charcoal to dichromate
   oxidation, related to an increase in the H/C of charcoal. Differential
   scanning calorimetry revealed the presence of three fractions of
   distinct thermal stability. Saturation of carboxylate groups with Ca2+
   under liming decreased the thermal stability of the O-rich, less
   thermally stable fraction of charcoal. This fraction decreased over time
   of cultivation, leading to a relative accumulation of the thermally most
   stable fraction of charcoal. This might result from the preferential
   loss of the O-rich fraction or the slowdown of charcoal from oxidation
   via association with minerals. Our results highlight the idea that land
   use significantly affects the properties of BC through the modification
   of soil conditions, which might influence the kinetics of BC loss from
   soil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   another, describing their spatial-temporal variability and any
   correlation with possible controlling factors. A grid of 100x100m with

   soil physical (i.e. soil texture, soil bulk density, macro-porosity,
   micro-porosity, air-filled pore space and total pore volume) and

   the MP was lower (t-test, p<0.01) throughout the experimental period

   area released significantly more CO2-C compared with the well-managed
   pasture. Therefore, the introduction of best management practices in
   pasture areas is an important strategy to reduce soil CO2-C losses and
   promote soil C accumulation. The MP presented lower FCO2 despite its
   higher soil C stock, indicating a more stable soil C condition when

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to understand the differences in
   physicochemical and microbial soil quality resulting from the use of
   either wheat straw or black polyethylene, two widely used practices in
   strawberry cultivation. Soil samples were collected from strawberry
   crops used during 4 years as mono cropping system, covered by either
   straw or black polyethylene (plastic mulching). Soil physicochemical
   properties included water content, pH, effective cation exchange
   capacity, elemental analysis of total carbon and nitrogen, dissolved and
   total organic carbon, and soil stability by percentage of water-stable
   aggregates (>0.2 mm). Soil microbial analysis comprised soil microbial
   biomass (C-mic and N-mic and DNA concentrations) and estimation of soil
   eco-physiological conditions C-mic:C-org and N-mic:N-tot. Soil bacteria
   and a fraction of cultivable fungi were studied respectively by
   molecular analysis and counting of colony forming units (CFU values).
   Mycotoxin concentration in soil (deoxynivalenol) was used as an indirect
   indicator of fungal stress. The plastic mulching system showed positive
   effects on soil physicochemical properties as compared to straw
   mulching: Higher soil carbon content and better aggregate stability were
   observed in soils under plastic film, and the values for soil microbial
   biomass were comparable in both systems. Yet, soil eco-physiological
   conditions under plastic mulching were less appropriate compared to
   straw, as reflected by a reduced C-mic:C-org ratio (1.3 +/- 0.3\%),
   followed by a decline of the number of bacteria (18\%), a six-fold
   reduction of the biomass of soil cultivable fungi, and finally by a
   two-times higher deoxynivalenol concentration in soil (mean 2.2 +/- 2.4
   mu g kg(-1)). This indicates that the plastic mulching system led to
   less favourable soil conditions and that the production of mycotoxins
   can be understood as a stress induced response by fungi. Further
   information is therefore needed to assess how the quality of soil is
   restricted by the shift of soil microbial communities and by the
   production of mycotoxins, especially in intensive agriculture with
   long-term plastic coverage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   from 0.0 to 0.05, 0.05 to 0.20 and 0.20 to 0.40 m to determine the
   percentage stable aggregates in each class (AGRI) and geometric mean
   diameter water stable aggregates (DMG). There was no change in the
   aggregate stability in the surface layer (0.0 to 0.05 m). However, the
   subsurface layers (0.05 to 0.20 and 0.20 to 0.40 m), just RT1 maintained
   stability of larger aggregates. Due to management adopted in RT2, such
   as burn and clear cut, there was a reduction in stability and increase
   in macro-aggregates smaller aggregates, whereas in the natural field
   stability in depth was maintained.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The projected intensification of agriculture to meet food targets of a
   rapidly growing world population are likely to accentuate already acute
   problems of soil compaction and deteriorating soil structure in many
   regions of the world. The key role of soil structure for soil functions,
   the sensitivity of soil structure to agronomic management practices, and
   the lack of reliable observations and metrics for soil structure
   recovery rates after compaction motivated the establishment of a
   long-term Soil Structure Observatory (SSO) at the Agroscope research
   institute in Zurich, Switzerland. The primary objective of the SSO is to
   provide long-term observation data on soil structure evolution after
   disturbance by compaction, enabling quantification of compaction
   recovery rates and times. The SSO was designed to provide information on
   recovery of compacted soil under different post-compaction soil
   management regimes, including natural recovery of bare and vegetated
   soil as well as recovery with and without soil tillage. This study
   focused on the design of the SSO and the characterization of the pre-
   and post-compaction state of the field. We deployed a monitoring network
   for continuous observation of soil state variables related to hydrologic
   and biophysical functions (soil water content, matric potential,
   temperature, soil air O-2 and CO2 concentrations, O2 diffusion rates,
   and redox states) as well as periodic sampling and in situ measurements
   of infiltration, mechanical impedance, soil porosity, gas and water
   transport properties, crop yields, earthworm populations, and plot-scale
   geophysical measurements. Besides enabling quantification of recovery
   rates of compacted soil, we expect that data provided by the SSO will
   help improve our general understanding of soil structure dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Within the Mediterranean basin, soil tillage enhances the mineralisation
   of soil organic matter. We assessed the short-term impact of shallow
   tillage {[}field cultivator (FC), rotary tiller (RT) and spading machine
   (SM)] on some soil quality indicators {[}bulk density, water-stable
   aggregates, total and labile organic C pools (microbial biomass and
   extractable organic C), soil respiration and related eco-physiological
   indexes] in a Sicilian vineyard. Also no tillage was included. We
   hypothesized that (i) RT and FC worsened soil quality indicators more
   than SM, and (ii) within the same tillage system, labile C pools, soil
   respiration and eco-physiological indexes will respond more efficiently
   than chemical and physical soil properties since the tillage starts. The
   experiment started at March 2009, and each tillage type was applied
   three times per year (March or April, May and June), with soil tilled up
   to 15-cm depth. Soil was sampled (0-15 and 15-30-cm depth) in March
   2009, April 2010, May 2012 and June 2014. SM was very effective in
   preserving soil organic matter pool and in improving any monitored soil
   quality indicator, similarly to no tillage. By contrast, RT was the most
   deleterious machine as it worsened most investigated indicators. Such
   deleterious effects were due to drastic disruption of soil aggregates
   and consequent exposition of protected soil organic matter to further
   microbial mineralization. Labile organic C pools and microbial quotients
   were the most responsive soil parameters for assessing the impact of
   shallow tillage on soil quality, even in the short term (<5 years).

   The mean values of WSC (43 mg/kg) and the physically protected carbon,

Abstract = {{Biochars are, amongst other available amendment materials, considered as
   an attractive tool in agriculture for carbon sequestration and
   improvement of soil functions. The latter is widely discussed as a
   consequence of improved physical quality of the amended soil. However,
   the mechanisms for this improvement are still poorly understood. This
   study investigated the effect of woodchip biochar amendment on
   micro-structural development, micro- and macro-structural stability, and
   resilience of two differently textured soils, fine sand (FS) and sandy
   loam (SL). Test substrates were prepared by adding 50 or 100 g kg(-1)
   biochar to FS or SL. Total porosity and plant available water were
   significantly increased in both soils. Moreover, compressive strength of
   the aggregates was significantly decreased when biochar amount was
   doubled. Mechanical resilience of the aggregates at both micro- and
   macro-scale was improved in the biochar-amended soils, impacting the
   cohesion and compressive behavior. A combination of these effects will
   result in an improved pore structure and aeration. Consequently, the
   physicochemical environment for plants and microbes is improved.
   Furthermore, the improved stability properties will result in better
   capacity of the biochar-amended soil to recover from the myriad of
   mechanical stresses imposed under arable systems, including vehicle
   traffic, to the weight of overburden soil. However, it was noted that
   doubling the amendment rate did not in any case offer any remarkable
   additional improvement in these properties, suggesting a further need to
   investigate the optimal amendment rate.}},

Abstract = {{Reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation in agriculture is a
   common alternative water source in arid regions suffering from fresh
   water (FW) shortage. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is frequently used for
   advanced TWW purification. Infiltration rates of water through the soil
   can decrease as a consequence of organic matter (OM) accumulation and
   the consequent induction of water repellency. In this research, soil
   heating to high temperatures was examined for its efficiency in OM
   content reduction and increased infiltration. In a laboratory experiment
   conducted using a hand burner and a combustion oven, water repellency
   was found to be reduced following increased heating temperature or
   heating duration, directly resulting in reduction of OM level. Chemical
   analysis of OM extracted from the heat treated soils revealed reduction
   in hydrophobic substances as a consequence of increased temperatures by
   soil heating and heating duration. In model ponds built to simulate
   large infiltration basins, OM content was reduced as a result of
   intensive and moderate soil heating in comparison to the untreated pond.
   However, no reduction in water repellency and only slight changes in
   infiltration rate were found as a consequence of soil heating. The
   differences in results obtained in the laboratory and the field
   experiments were probably related to the fact that the soil in the field
   experiment has been continuously reloaded with TWW containing OM.}},

   revegetation in desert areas. However, the distribution pattern of A.
   squarrosum and the influencing factors have not been sufficiently
   delineated. The results showed that the species richness and the
   abundance of A. squarrosum were decreased exponentially from the border

   scale, the soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil nutrients
   (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), and soil infiltration rate in the
   topsoil tended to increase from the center to the border within a straw
   checkerboard, while soil moisture presented an opposite tendency. The

   that the abundance of A. squarrosum was mainly determined by the

Abstract = {{Climate change impacts rainfall patterns which may lead to drought
   stress in rain-fed agricultural systems. Crops with higher drought
   tolerance are required on marginal land with low precipitation or on
   soils with low water retention used for biomass production. It is
   essential to obtain plant breeding tools, which can identify genotypes
   with improved drought tolerance and water use efficiency (WOE). In C-3
   plant species, the variation in discrimination against C-13(Delta,13C)
   during photosynthesis has been shown to be a potential indicator for
   WOE, where discrimination against C-13 and WUE were negatively
   correlated. The aim of this study was to determine the variation in the
   discrimination against C-13 between species and cultivars of three
   perennial C-3 grasses (Dactylis glomerate (cocksfoot), Festuca
   arundinacea (tall fescue) and Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass))
   and test the relationships between discrimination against C-13,
   season-long water use WUEB, shoot and root biomass production in plants
   grown under well-watered and water-limited conditions. The grasses were
   grown in the greenhouse and exposed to two irrigation regimes, which
   corresponded to 25\% and 60\% water holding capacity, respectively. We
   found negative relationships between discrimination against C-13 and
   WUEB and between discrimination against C-13 and shoot biomass
   production, under both the well-watered and water-limited growth
   conditions (p < 0.001). Discrimination against C-13 decreased in
   response to water limitation (p < 0.001). We found interspecific
   differences in the discrimination against C-13, WUEB, and shoot biomass
   production, where the cocksfoot cultivars showed lowest and the reed
   canary grass cultivars highest values of discrimination against C-13.
   Cocksfoot cultivars also showed highest WUEB, shoot biomass production
   and potential tolerance to water limitation. We conclude that
   discrimination against C-13 appears to be a useful indicator, when
   selecting C-3 grass crops for biomass production under drought

Abstract = {{Plastic-film mulch is a globally applied agricultural practice. However,

   assessed the effects of plastic-film mulch on soil aggregate water
   stability and pH in fields used for maize (Zea mays L.) production, at
   two sites in a cold semiarid environment, China. Four treatments were
   used: (i) no plastic-film mulch and no straw incorporation, (ii)
   plastic-film mulch only, (iii) straw incorporation only, and (iv) straw
   incorporation plus mulch. Seven years after continuous treatment
   application, the use of plastic-film mulch increased the proportion of
   water-stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) in the top 15-cm soil layer by
   16-28\%, across sampling times and sites. Straw incorporation similarly
   increased the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates. However, the
   effects of mulch, on increasing the mean weight diameter of aggregates
   were greater in non-straw-incorporated soils than in straw-incorporated
   soils, and vice versa. Soil bulk density in the top 15-cm soil layer
   marginally increased in the mulched treatments, relative to the
   non-mulched treatments, while it decreased in straw-incorporated
   treatments. In addition, there was a decrease in soil pH, by 0.19-0.54
   units, in the mulched, relative to the non-mulched soils. Combining our
   previous results, we suggested that increases in maize root growth and
   microbial activity were linked to the increased soil aggregation while
   accumulation in soil nitrate resulting from the stimulated soil nitrogen
   mineralization was responsible for the marginally decreased soil pH in
   the plastic-film mulched relative to the non mulched soils, due to
   increased soil hydrothermal conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of shelterbelts as
   biogeochemical barriers that can reduce the concentration of nutrients
   in groundwater migrating from adjacent cultivated fields. The
   shelterbelts differed in age, trees species composition and soil organic
   carbon content. The investigations were carried out in Luvisols, in the
   western part of Poland. Soil samples were taken from the topsoil (0-20
   cm) and then pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN),
   exchangeable acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), particle size
   distribution, bulk density, porosity and hydraulic conductivity were
   analysed. Introduction of shelterbelts in a uniform agricultural
   landscape is one of the best ways for managing the water regime in the
   landscape. Surface runoff and percolation of water through a soil
   profile are controlled by shelterbelts. The studies conducted in the
   agricultural landscape showed that the 200-year old shelterbelt (Old)
   with Robinia pseudoacacia L. as the dominant species and the 20-year-old
   (Young) multispecies shelterbelt effectively limit nitrate nitrogen
   (NO3--N) and phosphate phosphorus (PO43--P) in the groundwater. In the
   Old shelterbelt, the concentration of NO3--N was lower by 60\%, and in
   the Young shelterbelt, by 22\% in relation to the groundwater migrating
   from the adjacent cultivated fields. However, the concentrations of
   PO43--P decreased to 63\% (Old shelterbelt) and 56\% (Young shelterbelt)
   in comparison to the groundwater under the adjacent cultivated fields.
   In contrast to NO3--N, the ammonium nitrogen (NR4+-N) behaved in an
   entirely different way. The concentration of NH4+-N increased in the
   groundwater under both the Old and Young shelterbelts. The balance of
   nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and outputs in a shelterbelt indicated
   that the internal recycling of these elements is of crucial importance
   for the effective control of the spread of nitrogen and phosphorus
   compounds in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Organic farming is one environmentally viable approach to agriculture
   through its use of animal and green manures to provide nutrients and
   cultural practices to manage weeds, insects, and pathogens. The
   sustainability of organic agriculture, however, is less well understood,
   especially under long-term management. A study was conducted near Mead,
   NE, to investigate the long-term impacts of organic management on soil
   physical properties including soil aggregate stability, bulk density,
   Proctor bulk density (parameter of soil's susceptibility to compaction),
   water infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil-water
   retention characteristics in conventional farming (CR1), conventional
   farming with diversified rotation (DIR), organic practices with green
   manure (OGM), and organic practices with animal manure (OAM). The OGM
   and OAM treatments increased cumulative water infiltration by about 10
   times compared with the CR1 treatment, indicating that organic farming
   can increase water storage relative to conventional systems. Mean weight
   diameter of water-stable soil aggregates increased by 50\% with the OGM
   and by 30\% with the OAM treatments in the upper 15-cm depth, indicating
   that aggregates were larger and more stable under organic than
   conventional practices. At the same depth, the Proctor bulk density was
   3\% lower under organic practices than in the CR1 treatment, suggesting
   that organic farming reduces the soil's susceptibility to compaction.
   The increase in aggregate stability and porosity increased water infi
   ltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Overall, organic farming
   can improve soil physical properties in the long term and provide a
   strategy for farmers to enhance soil physical quality and agricultural
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services provided by tropical peat swamp forests, such as
   carbon (C) storage and water regulation, are under threat due to
   encroachment and replacement of these natural forests by drainage-based
   agriculture, commonly oil palm.plantation. This study aims to quantify
   how the chemical and physical properties of peat change during land
   conversion to oil palm. This will be addressed by comparing four
   separate stages of conversion; namely, secondary peat swamp forests,
   recently deeply drained secondary forests, cleared and recently planted
   oil palm, and mature oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia.
   Results indicate accelerated peat decomposition in surface peats of
   mature oil palm plantations due to the lowered water table and altered
   litter inputs associated with this land-use change. Surface organic
   matter content and peat C stocks at secondary forest sites were higher
   than at mature oil palm sites (e.g. C stocks were 975 +/- 151 and 497
   +/- 157 Mg ha(-1) at secondary forest and mature oil palm sites,
   respectively). Land conversion altered peat physical properties such as
   shear strength, bulk density and porosity, with mirrored changes above
   and below the water table. Our findings suggest close links between the
   organic matter and C content and peat physical properties through the
   entire depth of the peat profile. We have demonstrated that conversion
   from secondary peat swamp forest to mature oil palm plantation may
   seriously compromise C storage and, through its impact on peat physical
   properties, the water holding capacity in these peatlands. (C) 2016

   concentration, gas diffusivity, water location and water movement. Soil
   aggregates, 4-6 mm in diameter and collected from silty loam in Belgium

   scanner. Images with a pixel size of 6.9 mu m were then processed with
   Image) software for pore network analysis. The treatments were no
   tillage (C-NT) and conventional tillage (C-CT) in China, and shallow
   tillage (G-ST) and conventional tillage (G-CT) in Belgium. The results
   showed that aggregates in conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT) had
   numerous connected pores compared with conventional tillage (G-CT and
   C-CT). The Euler number (Ev) was significantly lower and visible total
   porosity and surface area (SA) were significantly higher in
   conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT) than in conventional tillage
   (G-CT and C-CT) in both studied locations.
   The predominant size of pores was significantly higher in conservational
   tillage (G-ST and C-NT) than in conventional tillage (G-CT and C-CT)
   (>150 mu m vs 90-120 mu m). Pore location within the aggregates also
   showed differences, with porosity being evenly distributed in the
   aggregates under conventional tillage ('G-CT and C-CT). Under
   conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT), the aggregates were
   heterogeneous, showing higher porosity at the center of the aggregates.
   There was a higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the external
   layer than in the internal layer in conservational tillage in Belgium
   (G-ST). In no tillage in China (C-NT), the SOC in the external and
   internal layers, however, showed similar results.
   Overall, conventional tillage (G-CT andC-CT) reduced the proportion of
   the largest pores within soil aggregates, whereas there was no
   significant relationship between pore morphologies and SOC content.
   Further investigation is required to measure the active and slow carbon
   pool distribution in the different layers and under different tillage

Abstract = {{Promoting soil carbon sequestration in agricultural land is one of the
   viable strategies to decelerate the observed climate changes. However,
   soil physical disturbances have aggravated the soil degradation process
   by accelerating erosion. Thus, reducing the magnitude and intensity of
   soil physical disturbance through appropriate farming/agricultural
   systems is essential to management of soil carbon sink capacity of
   agricultural lands. Four sites of different land use types/tillage
   practices, i) no-till (NT) corn (Zea mays L.) (NTC), ii) conventional
   till (CT) corn (CTC), iii) pastureland (PL), and iv) native forest (NF),
   were selected at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed Station,
   Ohio, USA to assess the impact of NT farming on soil aggregate indices
   including water-stable aggregation, mean weight diameter (MWD) and
   geometric mean diameter (GMD), and soil organic carbon and total
   nitrogen contents. The NTC plots received cow manure additions (about 15
   t ha(-1)) every other year. The CTC plots involved disking and chisel
   ploughing and liquid fertilizer application (110 L ha(-1)). The results
   showed that both water-stable aggregation and MWD were greater in soil
   for NTC than for CTC. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, the > 4.75-mm size
   fraction dominated NTC and was 46\% more than that for CTC, whereas the
   < 0.25-mm size fraction was 380\% more for CTC than for NTC. The values
   of both MWD and GMD in soil for NTC (2.17 mm and 1.19 mm, respectively)
   were higher than those for CTC (1.47 and 0.72 mm, respectively) in `the
   0-10 cm soil layer. Macroaggregates contained 6\%-42\% and 13\%-43\%
   higher organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, respectively, than
   microaggregates in soil for all sites. Macroaggregates in soil for NTC
   contained 40\% more organic carbon and total nitrogen over
   microaggregates in soil for CTC. Therefore, a higher proportion of
   microaggregates with lower organic carbon contents created a
   carbon-depleted environment for CTC. In contrast, soil for NTC had more
   aggregation and contained higher organic carbon content Within
   water-stable aggregates. The soil organic carbon and total nitrogen
   stocks (Mg ha(-1)) among the different sites followed the trend of NF >
   PL > NTC > CTC, being 35\%-46\% more for NTC over CTC. The NT practice
   enhanced soil organic carbon content over the CT practice and thus was
   an important strategy of carbon sequestration in cropland soils.}},

Abstract = {{Application of raw and treated wastewater for irrigation is an extensive
   practice for agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions. Raw
   textile wastewater has been used for cultivation in urban and peri-urban
   areas in Pakistan without any systematic consideration to soil quality.
   We conducted a laboratory incubation study to investigate the effects of
   low C/N ratio raw textile wastewater on soil nitrogen (N) contents,
   labile carbon (C) as water-soluble C (WSC) contents, and activities of
   urease and dehydrogenase enzymes. The 60-day incubation study used an
   alkaline clay loam aridisol that received 0 ( distilled water), 25, 50,
   and 100\% wastewater concentrations, and microcosms were incubated
   aerobically under room temperature at 70\% water holding capacity.
   Results revealed that raw wastewater significantly ( p < 0.05) changed
   soil N pools and processes, WSC contents, and enzymatic activities. The
   organic and inorganic N species increased with increasing wastewater
   concentrations, whereas WSC contents followed an opposite trend. The
   highest NH4 (+)- N and NO3 (-) -N contents were observed in soil treated
   with 100\% wastewater. The extractable organic N (EON) contents always
   represented > 50\% of the soil total Kjeldahl N (TKN) contents and
   served as the major N pool. However, nitrification index ( NO3-
   -N/NH4+-N ratio) decreased at high wastewater concentrations. A
   significant negative correlation was observed between EON and WSC ( p <
   0.05) and between net nitrification and WSC/EON ratio ( p < 0.01). In
   contrast, nitrification index and WSC contents were correlated,
   positively suggesting WSC potentially controlling N turnover in
   nutrient-poor aridisol. We found significant ( p < 0.0001) positive
   correlations of soil urease and dehydrogenase enzymatic activities with
   soil-extractable mineral N contents indicating coupled N cycling and
   soil biological activity. Higher production and accumulation of soil NO3
   (-)- N and EON contents in concentrated wastewater-treated soil could
   pose an ecological concern for soil fertility, biological health, and
   water quality. However, the EON could lead to mineral N pool but only if
   sufficient labile C source was present. The effects of wastewater
   irrigation on soil N cycling need to be assessed before it is
   recommended for crop production.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar has an ability to alter the biological, chemical, and physical
   properties of soil due to its physicochemical properties such as surface
   area, porosity, nutrient retention ability, available nutrient contents,
   aromaticity, etc. The present study was designed to evaluate the impact
   of physical properties and application rate of biochar on the hydraulic
   properties of a sandy loam soil in the short term. Biochar was produced
   at 500 degrees C from dried corn residue (BC500). The BC500 was
   incorporated at the rates of 0, 2.5\%, 5.0\%, 7.5\%, and 10\% (w.w(-1))
   into the sandy loam soil and filled up to a height of 4 cm, in cores
   having 5 cm diameter and height. Each treatment was performed in
   triplicate and equilibrated for 30 days. Then saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K-sat), water holding capacity (WHC), and bulk density
   were determined in each sample after four days of saturation at room
   temperature in a water bath. The BC500 particle size distribution,
   pores, and surface functional groups were assessed. The K-sat exhibited
   a highly significant exponential reduction from 0\% to 7.5\% of BC500
   application and approached an asymptote at 10\% BC500. Bulk density
   showed a significant negative correlation to biochar application rate.
   The WHC and BC500 application rate illustrated a strong positive
   relationship. Biochar surface was free from hydrophobic functional
   groups. The addition of BC500 has a positive influence on soil hydraulic
   properties, primarily due to the increased soil porosity. The BC500 is
   composed of a microporous structure and hydrophilic surface that retain
   water in sandy textured soils. The application of BC500 would be a wise
   investment to maximize the water use efficiency in soils for
   agricultural production.}},

Abstract = {{Brazil's riparian forests are continuously threatened by conversion into
   agricultural areas, causing not only degradation and loss of vegetation
   but also negative changes in soil properties and ecosystem services. In
   order to select vegetation and soil variables that are affected by
   degradation and to evaluate whether forest structure can be used as a
   proxy for soil ecosystem services, two watersheds in eastern Amazon were
   chosen as a study area in which four degradation levels were identified
   (very high, high, moderate and low), based on forest canopy openness and
   height. Vegetation structural characteristics, water infiltration rates,
   and soil properties were evaluated in 24, 1,000m(2) permanent plots.
   Results indicated that forest degradation significantly reduced soil
   carbon, phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, silt proportion, total
   porosity, and water content as well as water infiltration rate.
   Vegetation structure was a good proxy for monitoring soil ecosystem
   services (i.e. regulation of water flow, erosion control and
   life-supporting). Tree height and basal area, as well as herb biomass,
   were identified as the best vegetation indicators for changes in soil
   properties that underlie ecosystem services. Application of this
   strategy may facilitate the monitoring and modeling of riparian forest
   ecosystem services across broader spatial scales, to help guide

Abstract = {{Agricultural activities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and contribute to
   global warming. Intensive plough tillage (PT), use of agricultural
   chemicals and the burning of crop residues are major farm activities
   emitting GHGs. Intensive PT also degrades soil properties by reducing
   soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. In this scenario, adoption of no-till
   (NT) systems offers a pragmatic option to improve soil properties and
   reduce GHG emission. We evaluated the impacts of tillage systems (NT and
   PT) and wheat residue mulch on soil properties and GHG emission. This
   experiment was started in 1989 on a Crosby silt loam soil at Waterman
   Farm, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. Mulching reduced
   soil bulk density and improved total soil porosity. More total carbon
   (16.16 g kg(-1)), SOC (8.36 mg L-1) and soil microbial biomass carbon
   (152 mu g g(-1)) were recorded in soil under NT than PT. Mulch
   application also decreased soil temperature (0-5cm) and penetration
   resistance (0-60cm). Adoption of long-term NT reduced the GHG emission.
   Average fluxes of GHGs under NT were 1.84g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for
   carbon dioxide, 0.07mg CH4-C m(-2) day(-1) for methane and 0.73mg N2O-N
   m(-2) day(-1) for nitrous oxide compared with 2.05g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1),
   0.74mg CH4-Cm(-2)day(-1) and 1.41mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1), respectively,
   for PT. Emission of nitrous oxide was substantially increased by mulch
   application. In conclusion, long-term NT reduced the GHG emission by
   improving the soil properties. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{53-61}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize the ozone reaction with
   phenanthrene adsorbed in two types of soils (sand and agricultural). The
   effect of soil physicochemical properties (texture, bulk density,
   particle density, porosity, elemental composition, permeability, surface
   area and pore volume) on the phenanthrene decomposition was evaluated.
   Commercial sand has a uniform morphology (spherical) with a particle
   size range between 0.178 and 0.150 mm in diameter, regular elemental
   composition SiO2, specific density of 1701.38 kg/m(3), a true density of
   2492.50 kg/m(3), with an effective porosity of 31\%. On the other hand,
   the agricultural soil had heterogeneous morphology, particle size
   between 0.1779 and 0.05 mm in diameter, elemental composition was
   montmorrillonite silicon oxide, apparent density of 999.52 kg/m(3), a
   true density of 2673.55 kg/m(3), surface area of 34.92 m(2)/g, and
   porosity of 57\%. The percentage of phenanthrene decomposition in the
   sand was 79\% after 2 h of treatment. On the other hand, the
   phenanthrene degradation in the agricultural soil was 95\% during the
   same reaction time. The pore volume of soil limited the crystal size of
   phenanthrene and increased the contact surface with ozone confirming the
   direct impact of physicochemical properties of soils on the
   decomposition kinetics of phenanthrene. In the case of agricultural
   soil, the effect of organic matter on phenanthrene decomposition
   efficiency was also investigated. A faster decomposition of initial
   contaminant and byproducts formed in ozonation was obtained in natural
   agricultural soil compared to the sand. The partial identification of
   intermediates and final accumulated products produced by phenanthrene
   decomposition in ozonation was developed. Among others,
   phenanthroquinone, hydroquinone, phenanthrol, catechol as well as
   phthalic, diphenic, maleic and oxalic acids were identified. (C) 2016

Title = {{The trade-offs between milk production and soil organic carbon storage

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{577}},

Abstract = {{A possible agricultural climate change mitigation option is to increase
   the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC). Conversely, some factors might
   lead to inadvertent losses of SOC. Here, we explore the effect of
   various management options and environmental changes on SOC storage and
   milk production of dairy pastures in New Zealand. We used CenW 4.1, a
   process-based ecophysiological model, to run a range of scenarios to
   assess the effects of changes in management options, plant properties
   and environmental factors on SOC and milk production. We tested the
   model by using 2 years of observations of the exchanges of water and CO2
   measured with an eddy covariance system on a dairy farm in New Zealand's
   Waikato region. We obtained excellent agreement between the model and
   observations, especially for evapotranspiration and net photosynthesis.
   For the scenario analysis, we found that SOC could be increased through
   supplying supplemental feed, increasing fertiliser application, or
   increasing water availability through irrigation on very dry sites, but
   SOC decreased again for larger increases in water availability. Soil
   warming strongly reduced SOC. For other changes in key properties, such
   as changes in soil water-holding capacity and plant root:shoot ratios,
   SOC changes were often negatively correlated with changes in milk
   production.
   The work showed that changes in SOC were determined by the complex
   interplay between (1) changes in net primary production; (2) the carbon
   fraction taken off-site through grazing; (3) carbon allocation within
   the system between labile and stabilised SOC; and (4) changes in SOC
   decomposition rates. There is a particularly important trade-off between
   carbon either being removed by grazing or remaining on site and
   available for SOC formation. Changes in SOC cannot be fully understood
   unless all four factors are considered together in an overall
   assessment. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Pages = {{364-377}},
Abstract = {{The relationship of soil organic carbon (SOC) to soil water content
   (SWC) is primarily included in hydrological models through porosity
   where SOC is known to influence soil structure. The Soil Moisture Active
   Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) field sampling campaign
   in southern Manitoba provided both SWC and SOC data over three soil
   textural classes and a range of soil wetness conditions. Linear
   regressions were developed to predict time-averaged SWC from SOC in the
   surface 5 cm of 50 cropland fields during SMAPVEX12 when averaged across
   three wetness ranges. The prediction of SWC from SOC was tested on
   fields in the same vicinity as SMAPVEX12 that were sampled for SWC in
   2008 when soils were very dry. The measured SWC on the five sampling
   dates in 2008 was compared to SWC estimated for those dates from (1) the
   single-parameter regression equation from SOC during SMAPVEX12 dry days
   (1pSOC); (2) a `decay' formula (5\% reduction of a declining balance)
   (2pDM); and (3) a model based on field mean SOC with daily computation
   (3pSOCM). Both daily iteration models (2 and 3) required initial field
   capacity and rainfall data from 1 April. Models were compared with
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) and delta Akaike information criterion
   (Delta AIC). The two-parameter model (2pDM) had the lowest RMSE and most
   favorable Delta AIC scores for mean SWC of the five sampling dates over
   all fields. The single-variable SOC equation was equally viable in RMSE
   and Delta AIC to the other models on sand soils. On clay soils, 3pSOCM
   was advantageous on some sampling dates, demonstrating a benefit of
   including SOC with field capacity and precipitation. The predictive
   ability of SOC to explain time-averaged SWC variability in dry soils
   would be valuable for SWC model initialization and as a covariate for
   geostatistical downscaling from satellite SWC scales.}},

Abstract = {{Escalating greenhouse gas emissions are influenced by anthropogenic

   Pressure on already stressed energy, water provision, and management
   infrastructure including flood risks has mounted. Soil degradation,
   alkalinity, wastewater and solids management, trace metals and nutrient
   deficient drylands lacking water holding capacity have emerged as
   growing problems for Pakistan's economy. The increased pH of soils,
   contaminations of heavy metals, lack of waste treatment technology,
   unstable soil organic carbon and capacity of soils to exchange ions for
   the utilization by crop plants especially in dry land agriculture are
   notorious realities.
   Biochar, a product of biomass pyrolysis, improves the nutrient and water
   holding capacity along with production of syngas for bioenergy. Biochar
   allows to recycle farm waste. Biochar addition at 0.5 \% increased total
   organic carbon 23-30 \% in soil. Biochar produced at 400 degrees C with
   low pH and high cation exchange capacity is a better option than other
   amendments as it resulted in the highest values of cation exchange
   capacity and deemed fit for alkaline soils of Pakistan using suitable
   feedstock, preferably bagasse. Biochar combinations of high nutritious
   value, e.g. municipal solid organic wastes and animal manures, may
   directly provide plant nutrients. In arid areas, studies showed
   improvement in plant growth and yield by biochar application.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the current global attention on biochar (BC) as a soil

   15months after BC application and measured wet- and dry-region soil
   water retention, air permeability and gas diffusivity at selected matric
   potentials. At all measured potentials and for both sampling times, soil
   water retention was significantly higher (20-150\%) for the BC treatment
   due to increased fraction of smaller pores (< 30 mu m) at the expense of
   macropores (< 100 mu m). Although there was no consistent effect of BC
   on air-filled porosity, BC significantly reduced air permeability and
   gas diffusivity (similar to 20\%) at -30 kPa matric potential. After
   15-months, air permeability decreased by similar to 15\% after BC
   amendment, but analyses of the pore structure revealed a more tortuous
   and complex soil structure. Thus, application of rice straw BC to

   depths (the upper soil part 0-10 cm and the lower soil part 10-20 cm),

   upper part, the agriculture site had the lowest clay, silt, WHC, pH, P,
   K and OM, whereas it had the highest sand content. Most of these soil
   factors were highest in the soil from mature fir stands. As for the
   lower soil part, there were no clear indications among the land-use
   types. However, the agriculture site had the highest clay, silt and soil
   pH, whereas the pasture site showed the lowest clay, silt, P and K
   contents. The mature and young fir stands always showed the highest mean

Abstract = {{As our rapidly growing human population puts great demands on our

   that balance both food and environmental objectives. We focus this
   literature review on farm management strategies that tighten nutrient
   cycles and maintain yields. We examined six metrics for efficient
   nutrient cycling in agroecosystems: reduced runoff and erosion, reduced
   leaching, improved soil carbon storage, enhanced microbial biomass, low
   greenhouse gas emissions, improved water holding capacity, and high
   yields. We evaluated these metrics in six farm management practices:
   intercrops, agroforestry, cover crops, organic amendments, integrated
   crop-livestock, and conservation tillage. Agroforestry and cover crops
   consistently reduced runoff and erosion and improved carbon
   sequestration compared to conventional systems. Agroforestry was the
   only practice that consistently reduced nutrient leaching over
   conventional practices. Organic amendments and conservation tillage
   improve water holding capacity. There exists uncertainty in the
   effectiveness of these practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.
   Finally, although agroforestry tends to suppress yields, all of the
   practices had either a neutral or positive effect on yields. Evaluating
   cropping systems in terms of multiple services gives us insight into how

Title = {{Organic Carbon and Physical Properties in Sandy Soil after Conversion
   from Degraded Pasture to Eucalyptus in the Brazilian Cerrado}},
Journal = {{REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Abstract = {{Soil is currently seen as the most relevant carbon sink and the most
   effective carbon stabilizer. In contrast, agriculture is the second
   largest C emitter, after burning of fossil fuels. This organic carbon
   (OC) introduced into the soil, mainly via organic matter (OM), is
   essential for several soil properties and plays an extremely important
   role in sandy soils. The objective of this study was to describe the
   changes in the amounts and pools of OC and the influence thereof on some
   physical soil properties in areas converted from pasture to eucalyptus.
   The following areas were analyzed: a degraded pasture (PAST), two areas
   of pasture-eucalyptus conversion after 2 and 15 years (EU02 and EU15,
   respectively) and a preserved Cerrado area (CER) in the east of the
   state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Soil samples were taken from the 0.00-0.05,
   0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.30 m layers. The OC was measured and analyzed, the
   carbon pool (CP) calculated, aggregate stability, bulk density (BD), and
   macro-and microporosity determined, and total porosity (TP) calculated
   to analyze the influence of land use on soil properties. The
   experimental design was completely randomized, and four clusters per
   area were established, with nine subsampling points, for a total of 36
   subsamples per area, organized in 20 x 20 m grids, The soil under
   natural vegetation (preserved Cerrado) was used as a control. The change
   from CER to commercial cultivation accelerates the process of OC loss
   (reductions of 25-35 \%) and reductions in soil physical quality. In the
   PAST area, OC was reduced by 30 \% in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. Cumulative
   OC and CP were highest in the 0.00-0.05 m layer and decreased in the
   deeper layers in all land use treatments. Organic C in the 0.10-0.30 m
   layer was not influenced by land use, indicating the possibility of OC
   persistence in the soil for longer periods. Macroporosity and total
   porosity may be considered appropriate in CER and EU15, whereas the
   conditions for plant development in PAST and EU02 were restrictive. Land
   use systems reduced OC and the CP, indicating anthropogenic disturbance
   of the soil compared to CER. Fifteen years after planting eucalyptus in
   the pasture area, signs of recovery of some soil physical properties
   were observed, e.g., reduced BD and increased TP.}},

Abstract = {{The sugarcane industry in Belize is one of the main economic drivers in
   the country and is therefore of crucial social and environmental
   importance. This study evaluated the degree of sustainability of
   commercial sugarcane production in Northern Belize by determining soil
   parameters (physical and chemical) in three soil layers (0-15, 15-30 and
   30-50cm) and crop profitability relative to years of sugarcane
   cultivation (4-25years since land conversion). The parameters evaluated
   were organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, dry bulk density
   (DBD), porosity (integral), and water-filled pore space (WFPS). Field
   interviews were conducted to document management practices, agricultural
   inputs, production costs, and yield. The results showed that OM and TN
   in all soil layers studied and CEC in the 30-50cm layer decreased, and
   were negatively correlated, with years of sugarcane cultivation. This
   indicates that prolonged sugarcane cropping has detrimental effects on
   soil fertility. There was no clear pattern with years under sugarcane
   cultivation for P, pH, DBD, and K. Yield levels were maintained by
   intensification of cultivation, e.g. high inputs and regular replanting,
   providing short-term benefits at the expense of deterioration of soil
   fertility. The benefit to cost (B:C) ratio of sugarcane production in
   Northern Belize was marginal for American Sugar Refinery/Belize Sugar

Abstract = {{The degree of soil compaction is intensified by its inadequate

   i) soils with the same source material have distinct resistance to
   compression with increased NT adoption time; ii) the most sensitive
   indicators of this change are the ratios mass: volume and volume: volume
   and; iii) there is a relationship between resistance and compaction
   susceptibility with the amount and type of oxide. Soil samples were

   assess the impact imposed by the NT on the attributes density and

Abstract = {{Irrigation with wastewater provides the opportunity to solve the

   differentially diluted wastewater and undiluted wastewater (hereafter
   called wastewater) were used to grow wheat in sandy loam soil under
   fertilized and unfertilized conditions at the experimental farm of
   Bangladesh Agricultural University, Bangladesh. Fresh groundwater and
   wastewater of Mymensingh municipality were used to irrigate a wheat
   field for three consecutive years to examine the effects of wastewater
   application on soil properties. In this study, the properties of
   wastewater-irrigated soil were compared with freshwater-irrigated soil.
   The application of wastewater reduced the bulk density of the surface
   soil by 1.92\% and augmented the porosity by 5.89\%. The unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity of the soil were
   improved under wastewater irrigation. Soil pH increased due to
   wastewater application but decreased, to a smaller extent, due to
   fertilizer application. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) increased both
   with wastewater and with fertilizer application; both parameters changed
   significantly in the 0-20cm soil layer. However, at the deeper layers,
   they were not affected by wastewater application. The organic carbon (C)
   and total nitrogen (N) level of the soils were higher under wastewater
   irrigation than under freshwater-irrigated soil. The organic C increased
   by 23.93\% under wastewater irrigation in the top 20cm soil layer. The N
   content of the soil showed similarities with the organic C contents.
   Available P and S concentrations were greater in the soil irrigated with
   wastewater compared with the soil irrigated with freshwater. The
   exchangeable cations - sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and
   magnesium (Mg) - also increased significantly with wastewater

Abstract = {{Plant growth on sands is often constrained by water repellence, low
   fertility and low water-holding capacity (WHC). These soils also have
   low organic carbon (OC) concentration, particularly in a bleached A2
   horizon. Addition of subsoil clay to sands (clay modification) can
   overcome these constraints and increase WHC; however, little is known
   about the effect on OC concentration. Clay addition is predicted to
   increase OC storage via increased OC input from improved plant growth
   and increased stabilisation of OC by binding to clays. The objectives of
   this study were (i) to validate the number of soil samples required
   within a 25-m grid for accurate OC and bulk density measurement in
   clay-modified soils and (ii) to determine OC concentration, bulk density
   and OC stocks in clay-modified compared with unmodified soil. The study
   was carried out on two agricultural properties in South Australia, where
   unmodified controls (sands with 1-3\% clay) were compared with three
   methods of modification using clay (clay spread, delved and spaded).
   Soil cores to 50cm depth were collected after harvest within a 25-m
   grid. The study showed that clay modification could increase OC stocks
   (0-30cm) by up to 14tha(-1) in the South East and 22tha(-1) in the Eyre
   Peninsula. However, the magnitude of the OC stock increase was
   influenced by the modification method and depended on concentration and

Abstract = {{To assess the impacts of biochar application on crop productivity and
   global warming mitigation, a 4-yr field experiment was conducted in a
   well-drained Andosol in northern Japan. Wood residue-derived biochar
   (pyrolyzed at >800 degrees C) was applied at rates of 0, 10, 20, and 40
   Mg ha(-1) for potatoes, winter wheat, sugar beet, and soybeans
   cultivated in rotation, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions from the soil
   and yield and quality of the harvested materials were measured. Biochar
   application, regardless of rate, had no significant impact on yield and
   quality of the harvested materials, except for soybean grain yield. It
   also had no effect on cumulative CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions from the
   soil. Andosols are inherently highly porous, and biochar application
   increased soil porosity only at the highest amendment level. The small
   changes in soil properties and the recalcitrance of the biochar's C
   components probably account for the unchanged soil-associated greenhouse
   gas emissions and the minimal impact on crop yield and quality. Because
   soil CO2 emission was not increased, the net ecosystem C budget during
   the study period increased with the rate of biochar application from
   -3.55 +/- 0.19 Mg C ha(-1) without biochar application to 4.89 +/- 0.46,
   13.4 +/- 0.3, and 29.9 +/- 0.4 Mg C ha-1 at application rates of 10, 20,

Journal = {{SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Abstract = {{Soil moisture and Olsen P concentrations play an important role in
   phosphorus (P) losses in runoff. Under moisture-rich anaerobic
   conditions, the reduction of Fe-oxides dissolves P from the soil into
   solution that may be available for loss by transport processes. Under
   very dry conditions, soil hydrophobicity induced by soil organic C can
   exacerbate infiltration-excess surface flow and soil erosion. Our
   hypotheses were as follows: (1) rainfall applied to a dry soil would
   cause greater particulate P losses in surface runoff due to
   hydrophobicity; (2) P losses from a wet soil would be dominated by
   drainage and filtered P; and (3) both runoff processes would result in
   environmentally unacceptable P losses at agronomically productive Olsen
   P concentrations depending on the sorption capacity (anion storage
   capacity; ASC) of the soil. Superphosphate was added to a Brown and
   Organic soil (Olsen P initially 7 and 13 mg L-1 respectively) to create
   a range of Olsen P concentrations. Soils were placed in boxes, soil
   moisture adjusted (<10\% or 90\% available water holding capacity) and
   artificial rainfall applied at a rate equivalent to a storm event
   (5-year return interval; 30-35 mm h(-1)) and surface runoff and drainage
   collected. Surface runoff was measured as infiltration-excess surface
   flow from dry Organic soil (water drop penetration time >3600 s), and as
   saturation-excess surface flow from the wet Brown soil (water drop
   penetration time <5 s). Total P (TP) concentrations in surface flow from
   both soils increased linearly with Olsen P concentration. Compared with
   dry Organic soil, the wet Brown soil lost a greater proportion of TP as
   particulate via surface runoff. However, due to the high hydraulic
   conductivity and low ASC, the most important pathway for the Organic
   soil, wet or dry, was filtered P loss in drainage. These data can be
   used to more effectively target strategies to mitigate P losses.}},

   conducted on a land cultivated with wheat. The results showed that
   biochar had little effect on wheat grain yield, but it increased wheat
   vegetative growth and reduced seasonal cumulative soil N2O emissions
   from both compacted and non-compacted soils. Across all treatments,
   biochar-induced changes in individual soil N2O fluxes mainly occurred
   within a couple of days after nitrogen fertilization, and were sensitive
   to soil moisture, with an average increase of 13\% under low soil
   moisture conditions (<70\% water holding capacity (WHC)) that was likely
   driven by increased abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria,
   and an average decrease of 36\% under high soil moisture conditions
   (>70\% WHC) that was likely induced by raised abundance of N2O-reducing
   bacteria. The stimulated population sizes of nitrifiers and denitrifiers
   in biochar-amended soils were more dependent on biochar's chemical
   mediation (a shift of soil pH from moderate acidity towards neutrality)
   than physical mediation. This study indicated that biochar could
   alleviate soil compaction stress on wheat growth and mitigate soil N2O
   emissions, and to promote biochar's role in reducing soil N2O emissions,
   the best practice for nitrogen fertilization is before precipitation or
   followed by irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All. rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical regions have been considered the world's primary agricultural
   frontier; however, some physico-chemical deficiencies, such as low soil
   organic matter content, poor soil structure, high erodibility, soil
   acidity, and aluminum toxicity, have affected their productive capacity.
   Lime and gypsum are commonly used to improve soil chemical fertility,
   but no information exists about the long-term effects of these products
   on the physical attributes and C protection mechanisms of highly
   weathered Oxisols. A field trial was conducted in a sandy clay loam
   (kaolinitic, thermic Typic Haplorthox) under a no-tillage system for 12
   years. The trial consisted of four treatments: a control with no soil
   amendment application, the application of 2.1 Mg ha (-1) phosphogypsum,
   the application of 2.0 Mg ha(-1) lime, and the application of lime +
   phosphogypsum (2.0 + 2.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Since the experiment
   was established in 2002, the rates have been applied three times (2002,
   2004, and 2010). Surface liming effectively increased water-stable
   aggregates > 2.0 mm at a depth of up to 0.2 m; however, the association
   with phosphogypsum was considered a good strategy to improve the
   macroaggregate stability in subsoil layers (0.20 to 0.40 m).
   Consequently, both soil amendments applied together increased the mean
   weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) in all soil
   layers, with increases of up to 118 and 89\%, respectively, according to
   the soil layer. The formation and stabilization of larger aggregates
   contributed to a higher accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC) on
   these structures. In addition to TOC, the MWD and aggregate stability
   index were positively correlated with Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels and base
   saturation. Consequently, the increase observed in the aggregate size
   class resulted in a better organization of soil particles, increasing
   the macroporosity and reducing the soil bulk density and penetration
   resistance. Therefore, adequate soil chemical management plays a
   fundamental role in improving the soil's physical attributes in tropical
   areas under conservative management and highly affected by compaction
   caused by intensive farming.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality assessment has been suggested as an effective tool for
   evaluating sustainability of soil and crop management practices. The
   objective of this study was to develop a sensitive soil quality index
   (SQI) based on bulk density (BD), water-holding capacity (WHC),
   water-stable aggregates (WSA), aggregate mean weight diameter (AMWD),
   total organic C (TOC) and C input to evaluate the important rice-wheat
   cropping system on an Inceptisol in India. A long-term experiment has
   been conducted for 18 years at the Indian Council of Agricultural
   Research-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research, Modipuram, India.
   The treatments selected for this study were comprised of a no-fertilizer
   control and N, P and K fertilizers (NPK) combined with Zn and S
   fertilizers (NPK Zn S), farmyard manure (NPK FYM), green gram residues
   (NPK GR) and cereal residues (NPK + CR), laid out in a randomized
   complete block design with three replications. Soil samples were
   collected and analyzed for BD, WHC, WSA and TOC. Correlation analysis
   revealed that both rice and wheat yields significantly increased with
   the increases in AMWD, TOC and C input, but decreased with the increase
   in BD. The SQI values were then generated based on regression analysis
   of BD, WSA, AMWD, TOC and C input with rice and wheat yields for the
   0-15 and 15-30 cm soil layers, respectively. Regression analyses between
   crop yields and SQI values showed a quadratic type of relation with the
   coefficient of determination (R-2) varying from 0.78 to 0.89. With
   regard to soil sustainability, applying crop residues to both rice and
   wheat could maintain soil quality for a longer period, whereas the
   highest yields of both the crops were recorded in the NPK Zn S
   treatment. The regression equations developed in this study could be
   used to monitor soil quality in a subhumid tropical rice-wheat cropping
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Although anthropogenic dark earth (ADE) is generally found in
   non-floodable land, it also occurs on floodplains but, there is no
   information about the chemical and physical characteristics of ADE in
   this environment. In this study, we propose to check the hypothesis that

   conditions than an adjacent soil, no anthropogenic. Thus, the objective
   of this study was to characterize the chemical and physical properties
   of the top layer of two ADE profiles in a Gleysol and compare them with
   an adjacent soil. Samples were taken from two areas classified as ADE in
   Braganca, Para State, Brazil, at the ``Jabuti{''} archaeological site,
   and from an adjacent non-anthropogenic site. Disturbed and undisturbed
   soil samples were collected at the soil depth of 0.05-0.10 m for
   chemical (pH, potential acidity, exchangeable cations, and soil organic
   carbon) and physical (soil particle size distribution, particles
   density, water retention curve, total porosity, microporosity,
   macroporosity, and bulk density) analysis. `The two areas of ADE in a
   Gleysol, showed improved soil chemical properties compared to the
   adjacent soil, particularly in relation to phosphorus and calcium levels
   that contributed to higher cation exchange capacity which, in turn, was
   positively related to organic carbon content. Changes in soil physical
   properties were less noticeable but both areas of ADE presented higher
   water retention capacity, particularly at low tension. The improved
   conditions of the ADE soil under Gleysols shows that these areas are
   adequate for soil cultivation, especially with plants adapted to

Abstract = {{The potential benefit of biochar as a soil conditioner to improve crop
   yield and simultaneously sequester carbon in the soil, is a subject of
   intense discourse. Biochar amendment of agricultural soils is presumed
   to improve water holding capacity of the soil, and enhance nutrient
   retention within the root zone. However, there are very few
   investigations which provide quantitative data and qualitative
   descriptions concerning the specific mechanisms driving these
   improvements in the properties of biochar-amended soils. In this study,
   the effect of different rates of biochar amendment on some chemical,
   physical and hydraulic properties of fine-sand and sandy loamy silt
   soils was investigated by adding 20, 50 and 100 g biochar kg(-1) (by dry
   weight). In order to evaluate the additional effects of biochar
   application, the initial hydrophobicity and rheological properties were
   also examined. The result showed that biochar amendment improved total
   carbon and aggregate properties. The available water capacity was
   significantly higher in the amended substrates, particularly in the
   amended fine sand. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sandy loam
   silt increased between 25\% and 119\%, but decreased in the fine sand
   between 23 and 82\%. Moreover, biochar amendment of the sandy loamy silt
   improved particle to particle bonding and resulted in the development of
   weaker (compared with the unamended control) but more resilient
   aggregates which were better structured. With increasing rate of added
   biochar (>= 50-<= 100 g kg(-1)) the added biochar itself now dominated
   the internal soil strength of the substrate. Adding (>= 20 g kg(-1))
   biochar, to the fine-sand induced particle rearrangements, which in
   combination with possible surface oxidation at the biochar-soil
   particles interphase, improved bonding in this originally non-cohesive
   soil. Beyond an amendment rate of 50 g biochar kg(-1) soil, we observed
   that most of the positive improvements, associated with the biochar
   treatment of the soils, were no longer significant and the aggregates
   became brittle and collapsed more easily. Our results therefore provide
   more detailed insights into the effect of biochar in agricultural soils
   depending on texture of the soil and the amount of added biochar. (C)

Abstract = {{Predicting the capacity of soil to supply crop N (i.e., inorganic N) has

   water-extractable organic C and N, K2SO4-extractable C and N,
   mineralizable C on rewetting, and permanganate- oxidizable C-to estimate
   net N mineralization across a variety of soils from cover-cropped and

   that both biological and chemical indices are variable in their ability
   to predict N mineralization, with better relationships being shown for
   cover-cropped fields. Total C and N contents were the best chemical
   indicators for both management systems, describing up to 21.8\% of the
   variance. The flush of CO2 measured after capillary rewetting was more
   variable and had weaker relationships with net N mineralization than
   respiration measured at 50\% water holding capacity. These relationships
   were only significant in fields that had recently had cover crops and
   were moderately strong (r = 0.45-0.55), with the strength of the
   relationship decreasing as the measured interval of the CO2 flush
   increased. Models were developed for each management system using
   variables consistently chosen by a partial least squares regression as
   drivers of N mineralization. These models improved the explained

Abstract = {{Biochar amendment to soil is a promising practice of enhancing
   productivity of agricultural systems. The positive effects on crop are
   often attributed to a promotion of beneficial soil microorganisms while
   suppressing pathogens e.g. This study aims to determine the influence of
   biochar feedstock on (i) spontaneous and fungi inoculated microbial
   colonisation of biochar particles and (ii) physical pore space
   characteristics of native and fungi colonised biochar particles which
   impact microbial habitat quality.
   Pyrolytic biochars from mixed woods and Miscanthus were investigated
   towards spontaneous colonisation by classical microbiological isolation,
   phylogenetic identification of bacterial and fungal strains, and
   microbial respiration analysis. Physical pore space characteristics of
   biochar particles were determined by X-ray mu-CT. Subsequent 3D image
   analysis included porosity, surface area, connectivities, and pore size
   distribution.
   Microorganisms isolated from Wood biochar were more abundant and
   proliferated faster than those from the Miscanthus biochar. All isolated
   bacteria belonged to gram-positive bacteria and were feedstock specific.
   Respiration analysis revealed higher microbial activity for Wood biochar
   after water and substrate amendment while basal respiration was on the
   same low level for both biochars. Differences in porosity and physical
   surface area were detected only in interaction with biochar-specific
   colonisation. Miscanthus biochar was shown to have higher connectivity
   values in surface, volume and transmission than Wood biochars as well as
   larger pores as observed by pore size distribution. Differences in
   physical properties between colonised and non-colonised particles were
   larger in Miscanthus biochar than in Wood biochar.
   Vigorous colonisation was found on Wood biochar compared to Miscanthus
   biochar. This is contrasted by our findings from physical pore space
   analysis which suggests better habitat quality in Miscanthus biochar
   than in Wood biochar. We conclude that (i) the selected feedstocks
   display large differences in microbial habitat quality as well as
   physical pore space characteristics and (ii) physical description of
   biochars alone does not suffice for the reliable prediction of microbial
   habitat quality and recommend that physical and surface chemical data
   should be linked for this purpose.}},

Abstract = {{For the assessment of the extent of post-mine land degradation,
   arranging management practices for sustainable land use, and evaluation
   of reclamation success research on soil physical properties plays a
   significant role. The aim of this study was to quantify and interpret
   the effects of varied agricultural reclamation methods in order to
   assess which of the treatments yielded higher soil quality with respect
   to its physical state. Basic physical and chemical parameters (texture,
   particle and bulk density, total porosity, total organic carbon and pH),
   soil water characteristic curves, water and air permeability, structure
   of the soil damaged by mining in the area of internal dumping ground
   Patnow (Central Poland) were therefore measured. The soil samples were
   taken from the following 5 different variants of over 30 year-long
   reclamation: black fallow (BF), monoculture of winter wheat (WW),
   monoculture of winter wheat with a single application in 1992 of lignite
   dust (WW + L), monoculture of alfalfa with orchard grass in the
   proportion of 90/10\% (A+ G), and spontaneous succession (SS). We
   collected from each treatment: 12 soil cores for soil water and air
   properties; 6-kg composite bulk samples for basic physical and chemical
   properties of soil; 1 undisturbed soil block for structure analysis. The
   reclamation methods applied on the post-mining grounds influenced in a
   diverse manner the physical state of the 0-10 cm layer of the developed
   technogenic soil. Bulk density values generally decreased with the
   increase of number of factors potentially loosening the soil structure.
   The studied plots had sandy loam or loamy sand texture which determined
   their overall air and water properties. The soils were characterized by
   high macroporosity and favourable content of water available for plants.
   Less beneficial conditions of the soil were associated with air and
   water permeability. The present studies indicated that spontaneous
   succession, with the highest typological diversity of vegetation,
   contributed to the most preferred soil physical state. Remaining
   variants of reclamation (including black fallow without vegetation) also
   provided sufficient air and water relations in the soils. However, it
   should be emphasised that plants play an important role in TOC
   accumulation and ensuring relative stability of soil structure.
   Therefore rehabilitation of post-mining grounds involving vegetation is

Abstract = {{Over the past century, intensive agricultural activity in the Lower Rio
   Grande Valley, TX, USA, resulted in loss of more than 95\% shrub cover.
   Restoration efforts in these shrublands have resulted in successful
   reestablishment of native shrubs communities important for carbon
   sequestration and related wildlife habitat conservation. To examine
   future climate change effects on restored shrublands, we used the
   Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3-PG) to predict impacts
   on shrub growth compared to current production. Simulations were
   performed with 30 m(2) grid cells using monthly incident solar
   radiation, temperature, precipitation, available soil water holding
   capacity, and soil fertility within a national wildlife refuge located
   in the valley. The model was calibrated and confirmed by comparing
   remote sensing derived aboveground biomass to simulation under current
   climate conditions with overall good correlation (r(2) = 0.78). The
   model parameter values were derived from experimental and literatures
   appropriate for shrub species commonly found in the study area. We
   assessed climate change effects on simulated shrub biomass by using
   monthly temperature and precipitation projections for three emissions
   scenarios for 2050. Predicted aboveground biomass for the current
   climate (30.78 Mg/ha) was higher compared to that of B1 (29.77 Mg/ha),
   A1B (27.54 Mg/ha), and A2 (28.01 Mg/ha) emission scenarios. We found
   that productivity in this shrubland was controlled by VPD and soil
   fertility. We conclude that restoration efforts within the study area
   have shown potential for increased carbon sequestration in shrub
   vegetation under current climate, but future climate change is likely to
   reduce its carbon uptake efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Prediction and modeling of localized flow processes in macropores is of
   crucial importance for sustaining both soil and water quality. However,
   currently there are no reliable means to predict preferential flow due
   to its inherently large spatial variability. The aim of this study was
   to investigate the predictive performance of previously developed
   empirical models for both water and air flow and to explore the
   potential applicability of X-ray computed tomography (CT)-derived
   macropore network characteristics. For this purpose, 65 cylindrical soil
   columns (6 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height) were extracted from the
   topsoil (5 cm to 8.5 cm depth) in a 15m x 15m grid from an agricultural
   field located in Silstrup, Denmark. All soil columns were scanned with
   an industrial X-ray CT scanner (129 mu m resolution) and later employed
   for measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability at
   -30 and -100 cm matric potential, and gas diffusivity at -30 and -100 cm
   matric potential. Distribution maps for saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, air permeability, and gas diffusivity reflected no
   autocorrelation irrespective of soil texture and organic matter content.
   Existing empirical predictive models for saturated hydraulic
   conductivity and air permeability showed poor performance, as they were
   not able to realistically capture macropore flow. The tested empirical
   model for gas diffusivity predicted measurements at -100 cm matric
   potential reasonably well, but failed at -30 cm matric potential,
   particularly for soil columns with biopore-dominated flow. X-ray
   CT-derived macroporosity matched the measured air-filled porosity at -30
   cm matric potential well. Many of the CT-derived macropore network
   characteristics were strongly interrelated. Most of the macropore
   network characteristics were also significantly correlated with
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, and gas diffusivity.
   The predictive Ahuja et al. (1984) model for saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, air permeability, and gas diffusivity performed reasonably
   well when parameterized with novel, X-ray CT-derived parameters such as
   effective percolating macroporosity for biopore-dominated flow and total
   macroporosity for matrix-dominated flow. The obtained results further
   indicate that it is crucially important to discern between
   matrix-dominated and biopore-dominated flow for accurate prediction of
   macropore flow from X-ray CT-derived macropore network characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In the European Union, the maintenance of soil quality is a key point in
   agricultural policy. The effect of additions of dairy cattle (Bos
   taurus) manure (DCM) during a period of 11 years were evaluated in a
   soil under irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture. DCM was applied at
   sowing, at wet-weight rates of 30 or 60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (30DCM or
   60DCM). These were compared with a mineral-N treatment (300 kg N ha(-1),
   MNF), applied at six to eight emerged leaves and with a control (no N,
   no manure). Treatments were distributed in a randomized block design.
   Factors analysed were stability against wetting stress disaggregation,
   porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions and earthworm abundance,
   studied eight months after the last manure application. The application
   rate of 30DCM increased aggregate stability and the light SOC fraction,
   but not the pore volume, nor the earthworm abundance, compared with MNF.
   The DCM rates did not result in unbalanced agronomic advantages versus
   MNF, as high yields (12-16 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were obtained. In
   Mediterranean environments, the use of DCM should be encouraged mainly
   because of its contribution to the light SOC fraction which protects dry
   macro-aggregates from implosion (slaking) during the wetting process.
   Thus, in intensive agricultural systems, it protects soil from physical
   degradation. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter is critical to sustainable agriculture because it
   provides nutrients to crops as it decomposes and increases nutrient-and
   water-holding capacity when built up. Fast-and slow-cycling fractions of
   soil organic matter can have different impacts on crop production
   because fast-cycling fractions rapidly release nutrients for short-term
   plant growth and slow-cycling fractions bind nutrients that mineralize
   slowly and build up water-holding capacity. We explored the controls on
   these fractions in a tropical agroecosystem and their relationship to
   crop yields. We performed physical fractionation of soil organic matter
   from 48 farms and plots in western Kenya. We found that fast-cycling,
   particulate organic matter was positively related to crop yields, but
   did not have a strong effect, while slower-cycling, mineral-associated
   organic matter was negatively related to yields. Our finding that
   slower-cycling organic matter was negatively related to yield points to
   a need to revise the view that stabilization of organic matter
   positively impacts food security. Our results support a new paradigm
   that different soil organic matter fractions are controlled by different
   mechanisms, potentially leading to different relationships with
   management outcomes, like crop yield. Effectively managing soils for
   sustainable agriculture requires quantifying the effects of specific
   organic matter fractions on these outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Biochars' properties will change after application in soil due to the
   interactions with soil constituents, which would then impact the
   performance of biochars as soil amendment. For a better understanding on
   these interactions, two woody biochars of different surface areas (SA)
   were physically treated with aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) to investigate
   its potential influence on biochars' sorption property. Both the
   micropore area and mesopore (17 similar to 500 in diameter) area of the
   low-SA biochar were enhanced by at least 1.5 times after treatment with
   Al-oxide, whereas the same treatment did not change the surface
   characteristics of the high-SA biochar due partly to its well-developed
   porosity. The enhanced sorption of the pesticide isoproturon to the
   Al-oxide-treated low-SA biochar was observed and is positively related
   to the increased mesopore area. The desorption hysteresis of pesticide
   from the low-SA biochar was strengthened because of more pesticide
   molecules entrapped in the expanded pores by Al-oxide. However, no
   obvious change of pesticide sorption to the high-SA biochar after
   Al-oxide treatment was observed, corresponding to its unchanged
   porosity. The results suggest that the influence of Al-oxide on the
   biochars' sorption property is dependent on their porosity. This study
   will provide valuable information on the use of biochars for reducing
   the bioavailability of pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry buffers are believed to enhance soil quality parameters in
   agricultural landscapes. Soil enzyme activities, water stable aggregates
   (WSA), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (N) have been
   identified as good indices of soil quality. The objective of this study
   was to quantify soil quality differences among agroforestry buffer
   (AGF), grass waterway (GWW), grass buffer (GB), and row crop (RC) areas
   and distance from the tree base on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine
   max L.) watershed. Soil samples from AGF at 0, 30, 60, 90 cm distances
   from the tree base, and from AGF, GWW, GB, and RC areas were collected
   from summit, shoulder, and foot-slope landscape positions at the paired
   watershed study near Novelty, MO. Soil enzyme activity, WSA, soil C, and
   N were determined and data were analyzed statistically. The highest SOC
   and N percentages were found in AGF and the lowest in RC.
   beta-Glucosidase activity was not significantly different among AGF,
   GWW, and RC. beta-Glucosaminidase and dehydrogenase activities were
   significantly lower in RC treatment than all other treatments.
   Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity was not significant among
   all treatments. WSA percentage was significantly higher in GWW and AGF
   as compared to others. Landscape position was not significantly
   different for all measured soil quality parameters. beta-Glucosidase,
   beta-glucosaminidase activities, WSA, and soil N did not differ
   significantly with distance from the tree base. SOC and FDA hydrolase
   activity were significantly lower at the tree base. Results imply that
   permanent vegetation has improved the soil quality by enhancing soil
   microbial activity and organic matter accumulation, thereby contribute
   positively to watershed restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticides in agriculture are commonly used to meet the growing food
   demand; however they compromise the quality of water and soil. The
   pesticide 2,4-D is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world,
   it belongs to the group of synthetic herbicides that control broadleaf
   weeds. In this paper the risk of groundwater contamination by 24-D and
   its major metabolite, 2,4-DCP, is studied in a context of high density
   of soil worms. We compared the adsorption, desorption, degradation and
   displacement of 2,4-D in soils from Tabasco Region having different
   properties: clay, organic matter, iron and aluminum oxides contents. In
   addition to the classical soil physicochemical characterizations, a 3D
   analysis of the soil structure and porosity was performed by analyzing
   images acquired by Computed Tomography. The objective was to evaluate
   the effect of soil properties and macroporosity produced by the
   macrofauna activity on solute movement.
   All the four soils studied sorbed the herbicides, more importantly
   2,4-DCP, the metabolite, than 2,4-D itself. The distribution
   coefficients for 2,4-D sorption were linear and varied between 1 and 4
   while those for 2,4-DCP were above 10. The contents of iron and aluminum
   have an important role in the adsorption of these two compounds. In
   aerobic conditions, the herbicides half-life was about 2 days. Water
   movement occurred in physical equilibrium in three of the four soils;
   soil dispersivity ranged from 1.2 to 7 cm, clay content being the main
   factor. After 20 to 60 days depending on the soil, no 2,4-D leaching was
   observed through the soil columns, except for one soil were there was
   preferential flow. Earthworms burrows were exhibited and quantified in
   the soils samples through the analysis of Computer Tomography (CT)
   images, they appeared as small, snail-shaped, rounded volume of 3 to 7
   mm radius with a higher density with respect to the surrounding soil.
   They were extracted from the original data using a combination of image,
   processing and mathematical morphology operators. Based on the results
   obtained, it can be concluded that preferential flow caused by both high
   clay content and the presence of macrofauna pores significantly reduces
   the buffering capacity of the soil, increasing the risk of contamination
   by herbicides of the underlying aquifer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Most studies on changes in soil properties under no-till (NT) and

   assessed the seasonal changes of soil properties under NT and CT in two
   separate fields, i.e., flat farmland and sloping farmland, during the
   maize-growing season in a typical Black soil of Northeast China. We
   measured the total porosity (TP), >1 mm water stable aggregate (PA(1)),
   the mean weight diameter (MWD), infiltration rate (initial and steady
   infiltration rates, IIR and SIR), soil organic carbon (SOC), ammonium
   nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total phosphorus (TOP) content. In conventional
   tillage, there was a decline in TP, PA(1), MWD, infiltration rate and
   SOC during the experimental period in both farmlands. For NT, the
   infiltration rate decreased during the season but TP changed slightly;
   PA(1), MWD and SOC were higher in August compared with the other months.
   The highest values of NH4+-N and TOP were in June under both tillage
   systems in both farmlands. Compared with NT, there was higher TP and IIR
   in CT but lower MWD and SIR in May. As the season progressed, PA(1), MWD
   and infiltration rate were lower in CT than in NT from June to October.
   The greatest differences in PA(1) and MWD were observed in August at
   both sites. There was higher SOC and NH4+-N in NT but lower TOP in CT.
   There was better soil structure and infiltration rate in the early stage
   of crop growth in CT, while NT had a beneficial effect on soil structure
   stability and infiltration capacity at both sites during the growing

   collected from 50-year-old monoculture treatments of undisturbed
   (Dendrocalamus calostachyus, Mangifera indica and Saccharwn munja Roxb.)
   and disturbed (Oryza sativa cultivated field) land use. Our results
   showed that compared with undisturbed soils, soils under the disturbed
   use dramatically depleted in SOC, particulate OC (POC), non-particulate
   OC (NPOC), GRSP, easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and difficulty
   extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP). The depletion in labile POC was found to be
   little higher than physically protected NPOC, and were almost similar
   among the fractions of GRSP (each decreased by 50\%). Further, a linear
   correlation was found among the fractions of GRSP and SOC, and in turn
   resulted in the similar relationship with soils bulk density, porosity,
   pH, available phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic nitrogen's, cations
   (calcium and potassium), arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) abundance, and with
   microbial activity. These results indicate that the factors involve in
   SOC accumulation simultaneously encourage AM proliferation and in turn
   GRSP enrichment. Apart from this, the higher contribution of GRSP-C in
   NPOC (13 to 17\%), tended to increase with decreasing soil disturbance,
   suggesting the role of GRSP in accumulation and stabilization of SOC in
   this zone. A two component factor structure showed component 1
   considerably occupied by fractions of GRSP, SOC and those other
   variables favouring GRSP and SOC, primarily scored by undisturbed (M.
   indica and D. calostachyus treatments) soils. The second component which
   has fewer influence over soil variables, considerably occupied by
   microbial activity, electrical conductivity, cations and nutrients
   (available nitrogen, phosphorus) was also exemplified by undisturbed
   soils (except D. calostachyus treatment). Thus, improving GRSP and SOC
   stock in disturbed agricultural soil in studied area is of urgent
   requirement for the long-term goal of C sequestration and sustainable
   soil health. Our finding should stimulate managernent plans for degraded

Abstract = {{Yield stability is fundamental to global food security in the face of
   climate change, and better strategies are needed for buffering crop
   yields against increased weather variability. Regional-scale analyses of
   yield stability can support robust inferences about buffering strategies
   for widely-grown staple crops, but have not been accomplished. We
   present a novel analytical approach, synthesizing 2000-2014 data on
   weather and soil factors to quantify their impact on county-level maize
   yield stability in four US states that vary widely in these factors
   (Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania). Yield stability is
   quantified as both `downside risk' (minimum yield potential, MYP) and
   `volatility' (temporal yield variability). We show that excessive heat
   and drought decreased mean yields and yield stability, while higher
   precipitation increased stability. Soil water holding capacity strongly
   affected yield volatility in all four states, either directly (Minnesota
   and Pennsylvania) or indirectly, via its effects on MYP (Illinois and
   Michigan). We infer that factors contributing to soil water holding
   capacity can help buffer maize yields against variable weather. Given
   that soil water holding capacity responds (within limits) to agronomic
   management, our analysis highlights broadly relevant management
   strategies for buffering crop yields against climate variability, and
   informs region-specific strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of carbon (C) sequestered in soil is related to soil texture,
   soil management, vegetation, and climatic variation. However, in the
   Northern Great Plains, little information is available to quantify the
   effects of soil texture on the C sequestration potential of soils. This
   work was conducted to develop relationships for C sequestration
   potential based on soil texture under a variety of agricultural
   practices. Soil samples were collected from central and southeast North
   Dakota from sites with differing soil management and cropping systems;
   this includes native prairie, differing Conservation Reserve Program
   year classes, no-till, and conventional tillage practices. Particle size
   analysis was determined on the 0- to 15-cm soil depth using a hydrometer
   method. Sand fractions were determined by sieving. Carbon analysis was
   done by a high temperature combustion method. For all sampled soils,
   total silt (\%) was found to be positively correlated (P <= 0.01) to
   organic C content (percent organic C) and organic C mass (kg m(-2)
   depth(-1)). Sand was found to be negatively correlated (P <= 0.10)
   with\% organic C and organic Cmass. Soil clay content was correlated
   with organic C mass (P <= 0.05) but not percent organic C. Bulk density
   was found to be negatively correlated with percent organic C (P <=
   0.10). The strong correlation between silt content and soil organic C
   reflects the greater water holding capacity and plant available water of
   silt-dominated soils, which, in turn, affect plant productivity and
   influences C sequestration in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Column leaching tests were conducted to investigate the effects of soil
   physicochemical characteristics on metal mobility in the subsurface. The
   metals investigated originated from disposed industrial waste byproducts
   and from agrochemicals spread over the farmlands. Soil column tests can
   provide insights into leaching of metals to underlying water
   compartments. The findings of this study can be used for prevention
   strategies and for setting risk assessment approaches to land-use and
   management, and soil and water quality and sustainability. Soils
   collected from an industrial (IS) watershed and an agricultural (AQ)
   hydrographic basin were used in soil column leaching experiments. The
   soil samples were characterized for mineralogy, functional groups, grain
   size, surface charge, soil type, porosity, and cation exchange capacity
   (CEC) along with elemental composition. Varying concentrations of
   phosphogypsum industrial waste or agrochemical (NPK fertilizer) was then
   added to the surface of the packed columns (n = 28). The columns were
   subjected to artificial rain over a period of 65 days. Leachates were
   collected and analyzed for dissolved Na+, K+, and Cd2+ throughout the
   experimental period, whereas residual Cd content in the subsurface soil
   was measured at the end of the experiment. Physicochemical
   characterization indicated that the AQ soil has a higher potential for
   metal retention due to its fine clay texture, calcareous pH, high
   organic matter content and CEC. Metal release was more prominent in the
   IS soil indicating potential contamination of the surrounding soil and
   water compartments. The higher metal release is attributed to soil
   physicochemical characteristics. High calcium concentrations of
   phosphogypsum origin is, expected to compete for adsorbed bivalent
   elements, such as Cd, resulting in their release. The physicochemical
   characteristics of the receiving media should be taken into
   consideration when planning land -use in order to achieve sustainable
   development. Soil physiochemical characteristics play a key role in
   determining the behavior and fate of elements upon application of
   amendments. Sandy soils should not be assigned to industrial zones or
   landfills due to their high permeability, unlike fine clay soils.
   Furthermore, application of fertilizers on sandy soils can threaten
   groundwater quality, whereas their extensive use on clayey soil can
   cause soil salinisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation is a critical factor triggering soil biogeochemical
   processes in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we selected
   soils from two temperate forests-a mature natural forest and a degraded
   secondary forest in a semi-arid region. We investigated the pulse
   effects of simulated precipitation (to reach 55\% soil water-holding
   capacity) on the soil microbial respiration rate (R-s). We performed
   high-intensity measurements (at 5-min intervals for 48 h) to determine
   the maximum value of R-s (RS-max), the time to reach RS-max ( RS-max),
   and the duration of the pulse effect (from the start to the end of
   1/2R(s-max)). The responses of R-s to simulated precipitation were rapid
   and strong. Rs-max was significantly higher in degraded secondary forest
   (18.69 mu g C g soil(-1) h(-1)) than in mature natural forest (7.94 mu g
   C g soil(-1) h(-1)). In contrast, the duration of the pulse effect and
   RS-max, were significantly lower in degraded secondary forest than in
   mature natural forest Furthermore, the accumulative microbial
   respiration per gram of soil (AR(S-soc)) did not differ significantly
   between degraded secondary forest and mature natural forest, but the
   accumulative microbial respiration per gram of soil organic C

   Conservation agriculture technology has been extensively adopted in dry

   explored deeply. We conducted this study in order to: (1) examine the
   cumulative impact of tillage systems (CT, MT and NT) on weed emergence
   on the field; (2) test the effects of different tillage and crop systems
   on weed species density and diversity (Shannon's index, Pielou index and
   species richness) within the transient and persistent seed bank of the
   soil; and (3) analyse the impact of two soil parameters on weeds: water
   stable aggregates (WSA) and particulate organic matter content (C-POM).
   The highest weed density was recorded in conservation tillage systems
   (MT and/or NT) several years after the implementation of these systems.
   Additionally, the cumulative effects of conservation tillage techniques
   were found to have increased the seed density and species diversity in
   soil seed bank, which was probably due to particular conditions created
   in the soil; a low or negligible level of soil disturbance (as is
   expected with MT and NT) possibly allowed seeds to keep in the soil seed
   bank and remain dormant, due to, among other reasons, improved water
   stable aggregates and organic matter content. Results from the study

Title = {{Long term effect of conservation agriculture in maize rotations on total

Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{116-128}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Maize-based crop rotations are advocated as alternate to rice-based
   systems in South Asia due to better suitability for diverse ecologies,
   higher yields with less water use and more palatable maize fodder
   compared to rice, and increased demand of maize from piggery and poultry
   industries. Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are
   important management strategies for tackling the issues of soil health
   deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources,
   particularly in rice based intensive crop rotations. The conservation
   agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as
   zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to
   enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties
   for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term study was
   conducted to evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03)
   and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic
   carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic
   activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western
   India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, PB and conventional
   tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based
   crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS:
   Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-MustardMungbean, MMS:
   Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC,
   physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7
   years of continuous ZT, PB and CT in diversified maize rotations.
   Compared to Cr plots, the soil physical properties like water stable
   aggregates (WSA) > 250 mu m were 16.1-32.5\% higher, and bulk density
   (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P < 0.05)
   decline (11.0-14.3 and 11.2-12.0\%) in ZT and PB plots at 0-15 and 15-30
   cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34.6-35.3\%
   at 0-15 cm, and 23.6-26.5\% at 15-30 cm soil depths with conservation
   agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT.
   Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under CA based
   systems increased by 45-48.9\% in 0-30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam
   (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P < 0.05) improvement in soil
   enzymatic activities i.e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, beta
   Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the CA based
   treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) synergistic effects of summer legumes
   (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were
   observed on SOC,WSA, BD, PR and Ksat at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths.
   Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P <
   0.05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic
   activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that CA based crop
   management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and
   MWMb) can be advocated as sustainable intensification strategy in light
   textured soils of north-western India and other similar agro-ecologies
   of South Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The use of biochar as a soil amendment had been increasingly advocated
   for its effects on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission
   mitigation as well as on improvement of soil fertility. However, lack of
   a general assessment of biochar effects on soil physical properties made
   it difficult for the recommendations for its practical use for soil
   quality improvement in global agriculture. In this study, we performed a
   meta-analysis of literature data published by October 2015 and
   quantified biochar effects on selected soil physical properties. The
   literature data covered a range of feedstocks, pyrolysis temperature,
   soil and experimental conditions. Results showed that biochar amendment
   significantly improved all the soil physical properties tested. On
   average, soil bulk density was significantly reduced by 7.6\% whereas
   soil porosity significantly increased by 8.4\%, aggregate stability by
   8.2\%, available water holding capacity (AWC) by 15.1\% and saturated
   hydraulic conductivity by 25.2\%. Furthermore, the changes in soil bulk
   density were negatively correlated to porosity and AWC In addition,
   these effects were greater in coarse textured soils than in fine
   textured soils. While the size of biochar effect on soil physical
   properties varied with the amount of biochar added, changes in bulk
   density only was correlated to application rates of crop residue and
   wood biochar. Overall, biochar amendments could likely improve soil
   hydrological properties though varying with biochar and soil conditions.
   Use of biochar thus could offer a viable option to improve moisture
   storage and water use efficiency for soils poor in organic carbon in
   arid/semiarid zones. More studies on dynamics of soil hydrological
   behaviors following biochar amendment should be deserved in field
   conditions for a sound understanding of biochar's potential in world
   agriculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary between the humid eastern and the arid western regions of
   the Great Plains of North America is of great economic interest and
   historic intrigue, yet its location is controversial. Areas to the east
   of this boundary have historically enjoyed the benefits of fertile soil
   coupled with more favorable rainfall and reliable surface water,
   permitting conventional agriculture to flourish over a remarkably large
   percentage of the eastern Great Plains. The expansion of population and
   agriculture during the nineteenth century across the western Great
   Plains tested the extent that non-irrigated, row crop agriculture could
   be successful in areas where year-to-year rainfall was unreliable. In
   this paper, we quantify the historic annual variability of soil moisture
   and hydrologic conditioning in the Great Plains resulting from climatic
   variability, show the regions that historically demonstrate unreliable
   precipitation, and identify the extent of arid regions of the central
   United States based on modeled annual soil moisture variability. We
   asked how arid climates have influenced soil formation patterns at small
   cartographic scales, and how soil properties buffer or enhance soil
   moisture regimes (at the udic-ustic boundary) to climate variability at
   larger cartographic scales. At small cartographic scales, a climate-only
   model worked nearly as well as a climate-and-soils model in mapping the
   region's soil moisture boundary; however, a climate-only model missed
   important local soil influences. Finally, we demonstrate that long-term
   climate and climate variability are reflected in the depth and
   concentration of the calcic soil properties. From a practical
   standpoint, our work highlights that soils with higher water holding
   capacity dampen periodic short-term rainfall deficits, while soils with
   lower water holding capacity can exhibit edaphic drought during
   otherwise normal climate years. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Although soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in delivering various
   ecosystem functions and services, we are only beginning to understand
   how microbial communities are shaped by various soil physical properties
   and environmental factors. In this study, we integrate metabarcoding of
   bacteria and fungi and soil physical measurements at 60 locations on a
   15 x 15 m grid in an agricultural field to: (1) characterize the spatial
   variation of microbial richness and diversity, and (2) identify the soil
   physical parameters that are most strongly correlated with them. The
   study field is located in Silstrup Denmark, extends over 1.69 ha, and
   slopes 1-2 degrees to the north. Soil samples for 454-pyrosequencing
   were extracted by pushing 50-mL sterilized plastic vials into the soil.
   Bulk soil samples were used for the measurement of pH, organic carbon,
   and soil texture. Intact 100 cm(3) soil cores, collected in triplicate,
   were used for measuring the soil water characteristic curve. Across the
   field, bacterial richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices
   (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial
   autocorrelations. Fungal number of OTUs was quite similar over the field
   and thus no spatial autocorrelation was observed for them. Fungal
   Shannon diversity slightly increased from south to north, with spatial
   autocorrelation for distances larger than 100 m. The ratio of clay to
   organic carbon (n) was found to be the best predictor of bacterial
   richness and diversity indices. Neither organic carbon nor clay content
   was significantly correlated with fungal richness and diversity indices.
   For soil structural parameters, soil water retention in the pF range
   5-6.8 (parameter B) was significantly correlated with both bacterial and
   fungal Shannon diversities. Amount of macropores (> 30 mu m) and total
   porosity (phi) were only significantly correlated with fungal Shannon
   diversity. These results suggest that variation in microbial communities
   is not random but strongly related with variations in organic carbon,
   clay content, and soil water characteristics at the field scale. (C)

   changes, macroporosity (pores >60 mu m) decreased dramatically (from
   20.5 to 9.4\%); mesoporosity (60 to 10 mu m) increased and macroporosity
   (<10 mu m) is unchanged. Notably, more water was available for plants
   (from 6\% in 2008 to 10\% in 2014). This was led by a significant
   decrease in the volume of water that is strongly bounded to very small
   pores (<0.2 mu m). This is considered particularly important in this
   semiarid area having less than 400 mm of annual rainfall. These changes
   were more pronounced in soils with shrubs, particularly A. halimus.
   In this sloping area, the litter generated by shrubs did not provide
   greater SOM at the site where it occurred, but few meters below, where
   it was deposited by water erosion. Comparisons between downslope and
   upper slope soils yielded significant differences An increase in SOM
   (from 1.99 to 2.75\%); N (from 0.133\% to 0.196\%); CND (counting number
   drop) (from 16 to 34) and a decrease of bulk density (from 1.32 to 127 g
   cm(-3)) respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Use of compost as an alternative to conventional inorganic fertilizers

Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{Intensive crop over-fertilization is causing the diffuse contamination
   of superficial and ground-waters by nitrates in many Mediterranean
   areas. At the same time this practice is also damaging the soil in the
   long-term. In this work the feasibility of using composts as total or
   partial substitutes for conventional inorganic fertilization (CIF) was
   evaluated in two successive crops of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), one of
   the most consumed vegetables in Europe. The aim was to offer alternative
   agricultural practices that are more environmentally friendly.
   Treatments consisting of various rates of inorganic and organic
   fertilizers (composts) were assayed in quadruplicate on a sandy loam
   soil classified as Haplic Calcisol in Southern Spain. Macro- and
   micronutrients and heavy metal concentrations were analysed in soil and
   plant leaves. Parameters such as soil basal respiration (BR), microbial
   biomass C (C-mic) and dehydrogenase (DHA) and hydrolase activities,
   indicators of soil microbial abundance and activity, were also
   determined after each crop. After the second lettuce crop, certain
   physical soil properties such as aggregate stability and soil water
   holding capacity were also determined. In the first crop lettuce yields
   in the compost-treated soils did not significantly (p <= 0.05) differ
   from the yields of CIF-treated soils. In the second crop, however,
   lettuce yields were higher in organically treated soils than in soils
   receiving only inorganic fertilization. Organic fertilizers were able to
   supply sufficient nutrients to achieve similar yields as those obtained
   with additional inorganic fertilizer. After the second, crop,
   organically treated soils also showed higher C, N, P concentrations and
   higher C-mic, BR and DHA than soils receiving conventional inorganic
   fertilization as well as improved physical conditions (a higher
   percentage of stable soil aggregates and a greater water holding
   capacity). Also after the second lettuce crop, compost-treated soils
   showed significantly higher beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activity
   than CIF-treated soils. Furthermore, lettuces grown in compost treated
   soils showed significantly lower leaf nitrate concentration than
   lettuces grown in soil receiving CIF, thus reducing the potential
   toxicological risks associated with consuming nitrate-rich foods.
   Moreover, compost fertilization did not increase the concentration of
   heavy metals in lettuce leaves. Results confirm that manure and sewage
   sludge composts can be used as an alternative to inorganic fertilization
   in lettuce crop cultivation, leading to similar or even higher yields
   and reducing nutrient leaching risks, while improving soil chemical,
   physical and microbiological properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Effect of soil texture and wheat plants on N2O fluxes: A lysimeter study}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{17-29}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural soils are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
   and an understanding of factors regulating such emissions across
   contrasting soil types is critical for improved estimation through
   modelling and mitigation of N2O. In this study we investigated the role
   of soil texture and its interaction with plants in regulating the N2O
   fluxes in agricultural systems. A measurement system that combined
   weighing lysimeters with automated chambers was used to directly compare
   continuously measured surface N2O fluxes, leaching losses of water and
   nitrogen and evapotranspiration in three contrasting soils types of the
   Riverine Plain, NSW, Australia. The soils comprised a deep sand, a loam
   and a clay loam with and without the presence of wheat plants. All soils
   were under the same fertilizer management and irrigation was applied
   according to plant water requirements. In fallow soils, texture
   significantly affected N2O emissions in the order clay loam > loam >
   sand. However, when planted, the difference in N2O emissions among the
   three soils types became less pronounced. Nitrous oxide emissions were
   6.2 and 2.4 times higher from fallow clay loam and loam cores,
   respectively, compared with cores planted with wheat. This is considered
   to be due to plant uptake of water and nitrogen which resulted in
   reduced amounts of soil water and available nitrogen, and therefore less
   favourable soil conditions for denitrification. The effect of plants on
   N2O emissions was not apparent in the coarse textured sandy soil
   probably because of aerobic soil conditions, likely caused by low water
   holding capacity and rapid drainage irrespective of plant presence
   resulting in reduced denitrification activity. More than 90\% of N2O
   emissions were derived from denitrification in the fine-textured clay
   loam-determined for a two week period using (KNO3)-N-15 fertilizer. The
   proportion of N2O that was not derived from (KNO3)-N-15 was higher in
   the coarse-textured sand and loam, which may have been derived from soil
   N through nitrification or denitrification of mineralized N. Water
   filled pore space was a poorer predictor of N2O emissions compared with
   volumetric water content because of variable bulk density among soil
   types. The data may better inform the calibration of greenhouse gas
   prediction models as soil texture is one of the primary factors that
   explain spatial variation in N2O emissions by regulating soil oxygen.
   Defining the significance of N2O emissions between planted and fallow
   soils may enable improved yield scaled N2O emission assessment, water
   and nitrogen scheduling in the pre-watering phase during early crop
   establishment and within rotations of irrigated arable cropping systems.

Abstract = {{The mineralization of aggregate-associated organic carbon (OC) and the
   effect of long-term fertilization on its temperature sensitivity have
   not been addressed, but are critical for understanding OC sequestration
   and dynamics in agricultural soil. We measured the mineralization of OC
   in total soils and aggregates after 27 years of application of various
   fertilizers in a highland agroecosystem in central China and calculated
   the temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization. Our objectives were to
   understand the effects of long-term fertilization on OC mineralization
   in aggregates and its temperature sensitivity, and to determine the
   contribution of each aggregate size class to OC mineralization in total
   soils. Long-term fertilization decreased cumulative mineralized OC
   (C-min) in <0.053 mm size class but increased C-min in >2, 0.25-2, and
   0.053-0.25 mm aggregates. The increases were smaller in treatments with
   mineral fertilizers than with manure or manure combined with mineral
   fertilizer. The temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization was
   decreased in >2 mm aggregate but increased in <2 mm aggregates and total
   soils by fertilization treatments. The OC mineralization in <0.053 mm
   size class accounted for 36\% of the OC mineralization in total soils.
   Manure or manure combined with mineral fertilizer had a higher potential
   to change the contribution of aggregates to OC mineralization in total
   soils. Our results suggest that OC mineralization in total soils was
   determined mainly by mineralization in the <0.053 mm size class of these

   temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization in total soils and <2 mm

Abstract = {{A four-year field experiment was conducted with soybean-rapeseed

   conservation agriculture (CA) practices vis-a-vis conventional tillage
   (CT) on some soil physical, chemical and biological attributes of soil
   health. Application of fertilizer N, P, farmyard manure (FYM) and crop
   residues (CR) significantly increased water-stable aggregates and had
   profound effect in increasing the mean weight diameter as well as the
   formation of macro-aggregates. After 2 years of soybean-rapeseed
   rotation under CA practices, the formation of macro-aggregates was the
   highest in both surface (84 \%) and subsurface (80 \%) soil layers with
   application of 20 kg N+60 kg P2O5 + 10 t FYM+4t rapeseed residue ha(-1)
   applied to soybean and 100 kg N+30 kg P2O5+3 t soybean residue ha(-1)

   suggest that CA that integrates application of inorganic fertilizer,
   organic manure, retention of CR as soil cover, and minimum tillage is
   tremendously beneficial for soil health due to its positive effects on
   aggregation processes, augmenting organic matter accumulation and
   protecting within soil aggregates, and significantly enhancing

Abstract = {{Soil quality assessment was done in Grewia (Grewia optiva) based

   fallow and evaluated for different soil properties and soil quality.
   There were significant differences in soil properties and quality under
   different treatments after four year of plantation. Saturated hydraulic
   conductivity was higher in sole Grewia (1.45 cm h(-1)) plots followed by
   that under agroforestry plots (0.80-0.95 cm hr(-1)). Soil bulk density
   was least in sole Grewia plot (1.40 mg m(-3)) and was highest (1.50 mg
   m(-3)) in fallow plots. Water stable aggregates were 16-18 \% higher in
   agroforestry plots. In sole Grewia plots increase of 42\% was observed
   for water stable aggregates as compared to-fallow plot. Organic carbon
   increased by 13-46\% in different treatments as compared to fallow plot.
   N, P and K were also higher under sole,Grewia and agroforestry plots.
   The soil quality index (Q) varied from 0.32 in fallow to 0.50 in sole
   Grewia thereby indicating the superiority of forest land use system in

   Results further reveals that as compared to sole Grewia plots, there was
   33\% reduction in soil quality in fallow plots and 16.8-22.8\% in

Abstract = {{There is growing public interest and participation in food-producing
   urban community gardens in North America, yet little research has
   examined agricultural production and ecological processes in these
   spaces. We describe the agroecological and social characteristics of 61
   food-producing gardens in New York City, drawing on gardener interviews,
   land-use maps, plant species inventories, arthropod scouting, and soil
   sampling and analysis. Gardens contained agricultural crops, food
   production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in
   varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct
   purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average,
   gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 \%) to food
   production, and supplied a large share of their households' produce
   needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and
   Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop
   rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops
   in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils
   generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic
   matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive
   nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased
   exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter
   enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded
   action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on
   Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites
   on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less
   than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and
   woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 \% and 9 \% on average,
   respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate
   bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of
   differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in
   community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages.
   Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and
   practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient
   management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil
   testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing
   habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of
   insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4)
   Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into
   gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and
   offering these resources in multiple languages.}},

Abstract = {{Biochars vary widely in pH, surface area, nutrient concentration,
   porosity, and metal binding capacity due to the assortment of feedstock
   materials and thermal conversion conditions under which it is formed.
   The wide variety of chemical and physical characteristics have resulted
   in biochar being used as an amendment to rebuild soil health, improve
   crop yields, increase soil water storage, and restore soils/spoils
   impacted by mining. Meta-analysis of the biochar literature has shown
   mixed results when using biochar as a soil amendment to improve crop
   productivity. For example, in one meta-analysis, biochar increased crop
   yield by approximately 10 \%, while in another, approximately 50 \% of
   the studies reported minimal to no crop yield increases. In spite of the
   mixed crop yield reports, biochars have properties that can improve soil
   health characteristics, by increasing carbon (C) sequestration and
   nutrient and water retention. Biochars also have the ability to bind
   enteric microbes and enhance metal binding in soils impacted by mining.
   In this review, we present examples of both effective and ineffective
   uses of biochar to improve soil health for agricultural functions and
   reclamation of degraded mine spoils. Biochars are expensive to
   manufacture and cannot be purged from soil after application, so for
   efficient use, they should be targeted for specific uses in agricultural
   and environmental sectors. Thus, we introduce the designer biochar
   concept as an alternate paradigm stating that biochars should be
   designed with properties that are tailored to specific soil deficiencies
   or problems. We then demonstrate how careful selection of biochars can
   increase their effectiveness as a soil amendment.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter content in water-stable aggregates (WSA) in the arid

   soil organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents in agricultural lands
   with abandonment ages of 0, 3, 12, 20, 30 and 40 years, respectively, in
   the Minqin Oasis of Northwest China. The total soil OC and N contents at
   depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in abandoned agricultural lands were
   compared to those in cultivated land (the control). Agricultural land
   abandonment significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the distribution of MWD

   increases in MWD and the proportion of macroaggregates (sizes > 0.25 mm)
   as the age of agricultural land abandonment increased. The effect of
   abandonment ages of agricultural lands on MWD was determined by the
   changes of OC and N accumulation in WSA sizes > 2 mm. The total OC and N
   contents presented a stratification phenomenon across soil depths in
   this arid ecosystem. That is, both of them decreased significantly at
   depths of 0-20 and 40-60 cm while increased at the depth of 20-40 cm.

   the recovery of WSA stability and the shifting of soil organic matter
   from the silt+clay (< 0.053 mm) and microaggregate fractions to the

   (R-R-R); (ii) rotation with two rice crops and maize (R-M-R); (iii)
   rotation with two rice crops and mung bean (R-Mb-R); and (iv) rotation
   with one rice and two upland crops, mung bean and maize (R-Mb-M). We
   hypothesized that cropping systems with rotations of upland crops and
   their temporary beds improve the physical quality of paddy rice soil;
   hence, they are better options towards sustainable agriculture. Results
   show an improvement of soil physical quality for systems with two rice
   crops and one upland crop (R-M-R and R-Mb-R) and those with one rice
   crop with two upland crops (R-Mb-M) compared with intensive rice
   monoculture (R-R-R). This was translated in decreased bulk density and
   soil strength, increased soil organic carbon and total porosity, and
   higher aggregate stability index, plant-available water capacity, and
   Dexter's S index, especially at depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm. The
   systems with different upland crops (maize or mung bean) showed similar
   high physical quality improvement. To maintain soil quality in future
   seasons, introducing a cropping system with at least one upland crop in
   rotation with rice is recommended. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Application of organic waste on agricultural land as a soil conditioner
   and fertilizing material has lately gained much attention. This study
   was conducted to determine the effects of vermicompost applications
   (0.5\%, 1\%, 2\% and 4\% w/w) on physical characteristics of soils with
   different textures (sandy loam, loam and clay), under laboratory
   conditions. The results indicated that in the higher soil aggregate
   fraction (>12.7 mm) aggregate fraction was limited at the three soils.
   Vermicompost applications in all three soils significantly increased
   organic matter content. When compared with control, the increasing rates
   in organic matter content were 14.0\%, 23.8\%, 42.0\% and 90.2\% for
   0.5\%, 1\%, 2\% and 4\% vermicompost application doses, respectively.
   Vermicompost applications increased the wet aggregate stability and
   decreased the dispersion ratio of all the experimental soils in all
   aggregate size fractions. Overall, wet aggregate stability increased
   from 26.9\% to 52.2\% with the application rate of 4\%. Correlation
   coefficient between organic matter content and wet aggregate stability
   was found as 0.918{*}{*}. The lowest mean bulk density and the highest
   mean total porosity occurred when the most vermicompost was added. In
   all the soils studied, the highest permeability coefficients were gained
   with the application dose of 2\%. As a result of increase in wet
   aggregate stability and decrease in bulk density, air permeability
   increased, and penetration resistance decreased significantly. The
   results obtained in this study have clearly indicated that the
   vermicompost application is an effective way to improve soil physical
   characteristics. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{BREWING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{69}},

Pages = {{26-32}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Presently, diatomite is the dominant filter aid in the food and beverage
   industry due to its high porosity and satisfactory filtration
   resistance. However, its use is also regarded critically because of
   carcinogenic dust, possible trace emissions of heavy metals such as
   arsenic and, as an outcome of intensified environmental regulations, a
   future increase of disposal costs of the filtration waste. Therefore,
   improving cake filtration through the application of new filter aids and
   techniques substituting or reducing diatomite is a dynamic field of
   research.
   The present work was carried out using a new material as filter aid for
   beer filtration based on the natural rock alginite. Alginite is an
   immature oil shale from Gerce, Hungary. It consists of fossil organic
   and inorganic matter. To ensure compliance with the quality requirements
   and for the purpose of improving filtration properties of alginite, the
   material has to be thermally activated and washed. The obtained material
   A1000 is free from organic matter, shows only minor ion leaching and no
   swellability. In a laboratory filter system, beer was filtered with
   A1000 and diatomite as reference. The A1000 as filter aid leads to short
   filter service life because of a higher cake resistance due to
   beta-glucan retention. Cake resistance was successfully reduced by
   adding commercial filter aids, such as diatomite and perlite,
   respectively. The smallest cake resistance was observed upon mixing
   A1000 and perlite. A bright and stable beer was obtained using both
   A1000 and A1000 mixtures, what brings industrial filtrations with long
   filter service life within reach. Even more important, A1000 removes
   polyphenols during filtration, which is beneficial for an enhanced beer
   stability.
   From the disposal point of view, the agricultural use of filter cakes
   appears promising, because both alginite and perlite are well-proven
   soil conditioners. Hence, alginite use has the prospective of realising
   filtration processes in food and beverage industry with enhanced
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Little is known about how basic soil properties respond to
   contrasting grazing intensities in the Karoo biome, South Africa. The
   aim of this studywas to investigate impacts of long-term (>75 years)
   grazing at 1.18 heads ha(-1) (heavy; CGH), 0.78 heads ha(-1) (light;
   CGL), and exclosure on selected soil properties. Soil samples were
   collected to a depth of 60 cm from the long-term experimental site of
   Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute, Eastern Cape. The
   samples were analyzed for C, N, bulk density and infiltration rate,
   among others.
   RESULTS: Generally, heavy and light grazing reduced soil N storage by
   27.5\% and 22.6\%, respectively, compared with the exclosure. Animal
   exclusion improved water infiltration rate and C stocks significantly (P
   < 0.05), which was 0.128, 0.097, and 0.093 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for
   exclosure, CGL and CGH, respectively. Soil penetration resistance was
   higher for grazing treatments in the top 3-7 cm soil layer but for
   exclosure at the top 1 cmsoil surface.
   CONCLUSION: Although livestock exclusion has the potential to improve C
   sequestration, a sufficient resting period for 1-2 years followed by
   three consecutive grazing years at light stocking rate would be ideal
   for sustainable livestock production in this arid region of South
   Africa. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to assess some of the likely early impacts on
   soil properties in small-scale farmers' fields following conversion to
   conservation agriculture (CA) from annual ridge tillage (RT). Five
   fields under CA applied for 2 years (CA(2) (yr)) and 5 years (CA(5)
   (yr)), respectively, were paired with adjacent RT fields with similar
   soil type and maize genotypes. Soils samples from the 20 fields were
   taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm and evaluated for physical and
   chemical characteristics. The results of analysis of variance and mean
   comparison showed that soil bulk density and total porosity (PORt)
   largely remained the same between CA and RT fields. Soil structural
   stability (SI) was marginally greater under CA practices while RT
   appeared to sustain better soil aggregation and root-zone aeration
   characteristics (air capacity, AC). CA(5) (yr) fields showed greater
   values for soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen, available
   phosphorous, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Volumetric water
   content at field capacity (theta(fc)) and relative water capacity (RWC)
   were consistently greater under CA applied for the different number of
   years. The most influential soil attributes with loadings within ten per
   cent of those with the highest loadings based on multivariate principal
   component analysis were theta(fc), theta(pwp), theta(s), upper critical
   bulk density (rho(bU)), OC, OC-stock, SI, RWC, AC, theta(fc)/PORt, CEC,
   and K. Thus, soil attributes found as the most important to discriminate
   either management system were related to volumetric water content, soil
   organic carbon fraction, air water storage, and chemical qualities.
   These were considered suitable for future assessment of soil quality for
   monitoring land use change effects in similar agroecosystems. The study
   posits study of socio-ecology of mulch cover practices to attribute
   management effects on soil properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chemical cross-linking and the high molecular weight of superabsorbent
   copolymers (SAPs) are the two main causes of their resistance to

   monomers was wrapped in a geotextile and incubated in unsterile Haplic
   Luvisol soil as a water absorbing geocomposite. The highest number of
   soil bacteria that colonized the hydrated SAP and utilized it as the
   sole carbon and energy source was found after the first month of
   incubation in soil. It was equal to 7.21-7.49 log(10) cfu g(-1) of water
   absorbed by the SAP and decreased by 1.35-1.61 log(10) units within the
   next 8 months. During this time, the initial SAP water holding capacity
   of 1665.8 g has decreased by 24.40 \%. Moreover, the 5 g of SAP dry mass
   has declined by 31.70 \%. Two bacteria, Rhizobium radiobacter 28SG and

   able to biodegrade this SAP in pure cultures. They destroyed 25.07 and
   41.85 mg of 300 mg of the technical SAP during the 60-day growth in

Abstract = {{Climate and land-use models project increasing occurrence of high
   temperature and water deficit in both agricultural production systems
   and terrestrial ecosystems. Episodic soil wetting and subsequent drying
   may increase the occurrence and magnitude of pulsed biogeochemical
   activity, affecting carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and influencing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we provide the first data
   to explore the responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   fluxes to (i) temperature, (ii) soil water content as percent water
   holding capacity (\%WHC), (iii) substrate availability throughout, and
   (iv) multiple soil drying and rewetting (DW) events. Each of these
   factors and their interactions exerted effects on GHG emissions over a
   range of four (CO2) and six (N2O) orders of magnitude. Maximal CO2 and
   N2O fluxes were observed in environments combining intermediate \%WHC,
   elevated temperature, and sufficient substrate availability. Amendments
   of C and N and their interactions significantly affected CO2 and N2O
   fluxes and altered their temperature sensitivities (Q(10)) over
   successive DW cycles. C amendments significantly enhanced CO2 flux,
   reduced N2O flux, and decreased the Q(10) of both. N amendments had no
   effect on CO2 flux and increased N2O flux, while significantly
   depressing the Q(10) for CO2, and having no effect on the Q(10) for N2O.
   The dynamics across DW cycles could be attributed to changes in soil
   microbial communities as the different responses to wetting events in
   specific group of microorganisms, to the altered substrate
   availabilities, or to both. The complex interactions among parameters
   influencing trace gas fluxes should be incorporated into next generation
   earth system models to improve estimation of GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Organic amendments improve the quality of degraded cultivated
   agricultural soils. In this work, we examined the impact of an olive
   husk compost (OHC) on quality-related physical, chemical and biochemical
   properties of intensively managed greenhouse soil. To this end, a
   completely randomized block experiment involving a single factor and two
   treatments (viz., annual application of OHC at 30Mgha(-1) or no
   application) with three replications was used for 5years. The effect of
   the compost was studied at two soil depths (0-10 and 10-25cm) and two
   positions relative to crop rows (viz., on rows and between rows).
   Application of OHC increased soil organic matter (SOM) content, which is
   consistent with the low degradation rate of the compost in soil and
   confirms its usefulness as a source of organic C for soil. Increased SOM
   content resulted in decreased bulk density, and also in increased
   porosity and available water in the soil. The amendment was also an
   effective source of nutrients, particularly N, P, K and Ca, the last of
   which contributed to decrease exchangeable Na levels in the soil surface
   layer. The compost increased the activity of all enzymes studied except
   urease. This result can be ascribed to increased microbial activity, the
   presence of enzymes in the compost and their stabilization by organic
   matter and clay in the soil. Dehydrogenase and phosphatase were the
   individual enzyme activities in the soil, which were correlated with the
   largest number of soil properties favourably affected by OHC. Copyright

Abstract = {{Soil water-stable aggregation is an important process for carbon

   aggregates in vineyard soils differing in their genesis and texture
   under different soil management (vineyard rows - tilled and grassed

   to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) into water-stable
   macro-aggregates (WSA(ma)). The results showed that the WSA(ma) content
   of the soils ranged from 47\% to 97\%. Soils with grasses had a higher
   SOC and labile carbon (C-L) contents than the bulk soil and, as a
   result, the higher total WSA(ma) content. Soils ranged in a decreasing
   order in their ability to sequester SOC and C-L from bulk soil to
   WSA(ma): Haplic and Stagni-Haplic Luvisols > Calcaric Fluvisol=Rendzic
   Leptosol > Haplic and Luvi-Haplic Chernozem > Dystric and Eutric

   WSA(ma) to that in bulk soil was 1.0 at the maximum WSA(ma) content

   threshold value (1.0) resulted in a decrease in WSA(ma) content.}},

Abstract = {{In South East Asia, increased population and agricultural demands,
   especially for oil palm cultivation, have led to peatland conversion,
   resulting in environmental degradation. To conserve peatland's function
   as a biodiversity and carbon reservoir, restoration of an oil palm
   plantation after burning in tropical peat swamp area was carried out by
   revegetation using native peat swamp forest plants, together with land
   rewetting. To monitor the success of the restoration process, soil
   sampling was carried from that restoration area as well as surrounding
   natural forest and burned oil palm plantation as comparisons. Analyses
   of physico-chemical and biological revealed substantial differences
   after 3.5 years of restoration between the restored soil and both burned
   oil palm plantation and the natural forest soils. These differences were
   seen in both physical and chemical characteristics (including water

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{33-38}},
Abstract = {{Irrigated fields are playing an important role in assuring world
   population with qualitative food products. However intensive cultivation
   combined with irrigation lead to negative changes in soil physical and
   chemical properties. There have been done few comprehensive studies on
   how irrigation affects soil physical fertility. This article presents an
   evaluation of an irrigated Fluvisol from the Inferior Dniester
   floodplain, in the Republic of Moldova. The results reveal that 50 years
   of irrigation and intensive cultivation of Eutric Fluvisol with clay
   texture had a negative impact on the soil physical quality. Low inputs
   of organic fertilizer lead to a decrease in soil organic carbon content,
   negatively influencing soil properties. Major changes were reflected in
   the distribution of structural aggregates, so that the proportion of
   clods in the first layer was moderate (38.2\%), but in the subsequent
   layer was very high (81.7\%). Due to the high clay content, it has a
   high water stability of macroaggregates in both 0-20 cm and 20-38 cm
   layer. The results also show that soil has an increased bulk density,
   low total porosity which is decreasing with the depth, and high
   compaction degree. This study will be used as a start point for the
   future research of the utilization of the cover crops in irrigated
   agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Legume forage crops have the ability of retaining free nitrogen in the
   air through symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria found in their roots.
   Additionally, microbial biomass (MB)-an essential living component of
   soil and a significant factor influencing plant nutrient dynamics-is
   considered to be accurate indicator of soil's biological condition.
   Given the aforementioned aspects, soil MB C (C-mic) and MB N (N-mic) of
   different legume forage crops were investigated in this study. Soil
   samples were taken in order to identify certain physical and chemical
   characteristics of the soil using volume cylinders (0 - 6.5 cm depth)
   from Vicia sativa L. (VSP) and Medicago sativa L. planted (MSP) areas.
   To determine the C-mic and N-mic contents, topsoil samples were also
   taken from 0 - 6.5 cm depth. C-mic and N-mic contents were identified
   using chloroform - fumigation - extraction method. There was no
   statistical significance for particle density, bulk density, electrical
   conductivity, CaCO3 \%, and decomposition ratio (C-org/ N-total) of the
   VSP and MSP soil (P > 0.05). However, some other soil characteristics
   such as temperature, porosity, sand, silt and clay contents, pH, organic
   C and total N differed significantly (P < 0.05). Compared to VSP soil,
   the C-mic contents were determined to be 27 \% higher (P < 0.05) in MSP
   soil. In VSP soil, the soil N-mic content ranged from 83.38 mu g g(-1)
   to 124.67 mu g g(-1), while it ranged from 91.62 mu g g(-1) to 187.07 mu
   g g(-1) in MSP soil. The N-mic content of the MSP soil was observed to
   be approximately 35 \% higher than VSP soil, and a statistically
   significant difference (P < 0.05) was noticed between the two. Moreover,
   a significant positive correlation was found not only between the C-mic
   and organic C contents (r = 0.667; P < 0.05) but also between the N-mic
   and total N contents of MSP and VSP soil (r = 0.881; P < 0.01). The
   results of the study revealed that soil C-mic and N-mic values differ as
   the types of planted legume forage crops change. Furthermore, the
   obtained soil C-mic and N-mic results indicate that soil MSP soil is
   more fertile than VSP soil.}},

Abstract = {{Soil amendment with fly ash (FA) and combined supplementation with

   experiments with rice. Amendments with FA levels, 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,
   8.0 and 10.0 kg/m(2), caused increase in growth and yield of rice up to
   8.0 kg/m(2), monitored with several parameters. Pigment contents and
   enzyme activities of leaves were enhanced by FA, with the maximum level
   of FA at 10.0 kg/m(2). Protein content of rice seeds was the highest in
   plants grown at FA level 4.0 kg/m(2). Basic soil properties, pH value,
   percentage of silt, percentage of clay, water-holding capacity,
   electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon
   content increased due to the FA amendment. Parallel supplementation of
   FA amended plots with 1.0 kg/m(2) N-2-fixing cyanobacteria mass caused
   further significant increments of the most soil properties, and rice
   growth and yield parameters. 1000-grain weight of rice plants grown at
   FA level 4.0 kg/m(2) along with cyanobacteria supplementation was the
   maximum. Cyanobacteria supplementation caused increase of important
   basic properties of soil including the total N-content. Estimations of
   elemental content in soils and plant parts (root and seed) were done by
   the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Accumulations of K, P, Fe and
   several plant micronutrients (Mn, Ni, Co, Zn and Cu) and toxic elements
   (Pb, Cr and Cd) increased in soils and plant parts as a function of the
   FA gradation, but Na content remained almost unchanged in soils and
   seeds. Supplementation of cyanobacteria had ameliorating effect on toxic
   metal contents of soils and plant parts. The FA level 4.0 kg/m(2), with
   1.0 kg/m(2) cyanobacteria mass supplementation, could be taken ideal,
   since there would be recharging of the soil with essential
   micronutrients as well as toxic chemicals in comparative lesser

Abstract = {{The soil porous space is where processes related to gases and soil
   solution occur, and provides an adequate guide for agricultural

   cultivation and the application of liquid bovine biofertilizer on the
   porous network of a Typic Haplocambids (Cambissolo Haplico Ta Eutrofico)
   cultivated with figs (Ficus carica L.). Four treatments were evaluated
   (under fig cultivation with the application of 20, 40 and 60 \% of
   biofertilizer through irrigation, a control treatment without
   biofertilizer and an additional treatment-soil under natural
   vegetation). Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected in
   three soil layers (0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 m) with four replicates.
   The following physical properties were analyzed: particle-size
   distribution, soil bulk and particle densities, and soil water retention
   curve. The coefficient of intrinsic soil air permeability was calculated
   based on the equation that considers the decreasing pressure method.
   Soil porosity, pore continuity index and blocked porosity were
   calculated and pore length was estimated. Compared with the native
   forest, pore network quality is improved, if not maintained, when the
   soil is cultivated under the conditions described in this experiment. In
   the conditions of cultivation, the application of bovine biofertilizer,
   for supplying sediments that block or reduce the size of the pores, did
   not improve soil air permeability. The cases where pore network quality
   was worsened in soil porosity as a result of the applied treatments
   (Biofertilizer 20 \%, Biofertilizer 40 \% and Biofertilizer 60 \% for
   the layer of 0.0-0.1 m and Biofertilizer 60 \% for 0.1-0.2 m), although
   not considered critical to plant development, point to the need for
   specific management practices (for instance, avoid coarse residues in
   the biofertilizer before its application) to avoid soil degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) has the potential to benefit soil function and
   fertility, and in agricultural production systems, it is considered
   integral to sustainable farming. We analyse the value of SOC in cropping
   systems of the southwest of Western Australia in terms of agronomic
   benefits from increasing productivity (through increased plant-available
   water-holding capacity) and reducing fertiliser use (due to increased
   mineralisation of nitrogen). We also present the potential value of SOC
   in terms of sequestration benefit if landholders were able to
   participate in a carbon-sequestration program. We estimate the marginal
   value of SOC (the value of a soil with more SOC, by 1 t C/ha, than a
   standard soil) to be AU\$7.1-8.7/tC. ha. year, depending on rainfall
   zone and crop type. Approximately 75\% of this value is the estimated
   sequestration value, 20\% is the nitrogen-replacement value, and 5\% is
   the estimated productivity improvement value. Over 50 years, this
   equates \$130-160/t C. ha depending on the rainfall zone. These values
   are sensitive to variations in fertiliser and carbon prices. Our results

Abstract = {{The contribution of the introduced species Amynthas gracilis (Kinberg,
   1867) and Octolasion cyaneum (Savigny, 1826) to the physical stability
   of the soil was evaluated in a mesocosm experiment. Pore formation and
   stable aggregates were measured; as well as changes in bulk density,
   porosity, and soil moisture. Mesocosm pots were organized into three
   treatments: 1 - soil + Amynthasgracilis, 2 - soil + Octolasion cyaneum
   and 3 - soil (control containers). The experiment ran for 13 weeks and
   it was conducted in controlled conditions in a greenhouse. At the end of
   the experiment both treatments with earthworms had higher number of
   pores and stable aggregates at the two considered depths (0 - 5 cm and 5
   - 10 cm). The presence of both earthworm species favors the formation of
   a significantly higher proportion of stable aggregates larger than 5 mm
   (60\%), when compared to the control without worms. These structures
   helped maintaining bulk density and porosity and improved water
   circulation. The results show that when compared to the control, both
   treatments had a lower loss of pore space, lower bulk density, and
   higher soil moisture, all attributable to earthworm presence. It is
   concluded that, despite both being introduced species, in intensive
   agricultural systems, A. gracilis and O. cyaneum can contribute to the
   maintenance of soil physical stability thus helping to preserve the
   sustainability of agro-ecosystems, even if native species became rare or

Abstract = {{Abandonment of agricultural land leads to changes in soil
   characteristics that may result in better or worse soil conditions.
   These changes are slow therefore the use of indicators for dating the
   time of abandonment is particularly useful. This study was carried out
   in Madrid, Spain with the aim to establish for the first time the use of
   Retama sphaerocarpa L. (Boiss) as a dendrochronological tool for dating
   land abandonment. This offers the possibility to take into consideration
   a period of time long enough for changes in soil to be determined. Such
   changes can be indicated by fluctuations in soil organic carbon content
   (SOC), porosity or water availability. Three different situations
   resulted from the dendrochronological analysis: soil currently tilled;
   soil recently abandoned (less than 5 years), and prolonged abandonment
   (in average 10 years). In addition the influence of Retama sphaerocarpa
   L. (Boiss) on soils was checked for these periods of abandonment. The
   rate of SOC gain can be considered fast. Tilled soils accounted for
   0.48\% SOC, and reached 1\% in less than 5 years, although with wide
   standard deviations. Due to prolonged abandonment SOC reached 1.41\%, (P
   = 0.09). Total soil porosity under tillage was 49\%, and decreased to
   38\% after 4-5 years, but recovered to 41\% under prolonged abandonment.
   Water availability (volumetric soil moisture between field capacity and
   permanent wilting point) remained the same, ranging from 7.7 to 8.5\%
   along the whole period of time. The presence of R. sphaerocarpa L.

Abstract = {{For nearly a decade, there has been an increased awareness toward food
   quality, health standards, and global environmental issues in our
   communities. In that context, adoption of organic production practices
   has been increasing rapidly in vegetable production. Organic farming is
   grounded in a holistic view of agriculture that aims to reflect a
   profound interrelationship between on-farm living biota, farm
   production, and the overall environment. Organic agriculture has emerged
   as a powerful tool in re-establishing production practices that are
   self-sufficient, promote biodiversity, and support practices that
   conserve soil, water, and the environment. Organic production systems
   utilize practices such as composting, crop rotation, and use of cover
   crops, all of which have a positive impact on soil physical, chemical,
   and biological properties. Although these practices are widely used,
   there is still uncertainty among growers when it comes to the actual
   process of composting, compost nutrient concentration and availability,
   use of compost in transplant mixes, and application rates. Similarly,
   other areas that need attention are crop rotation, sequence of crops
   within a rotation, and integration of cover crops in these rotations.
   Cover crops have an important role in reducing soil erosion, suppressing
   weeds, improving soil structure and water holding capacity, and
   increasing soil organic matter. This chapter will highlight the role of
   composting, use of compost, crop rotation, and cover crops in organic
   vegetable production systems. This chapter will discuss in detail the
   composting process, raw materials used, composting methods, quality
   assessment of compost, and potential avenues where compost can be used
   in organic vegetable production. The crop rotation portion of this
   chapter will highlight various crop rotation plans and strategies that
   growers could utilize to improve soil quality, break pest and disease
   cycles, and increase yields. The chapter will also provide information
   on cover crop types, their planting, management, benefits, and
   challenges in organic vegetable cropping systems. Organic production
   systems are complex and dynamic. Understanding techniques and practices
   that directly influence soil is critical in building a production system
   that is self-sustaining, strong, and resilient. A better understanding
   of such practices is of paramount importance to build, strengthen, and
   support organic vegetable production.}},

Abstract = {{Chlordecone, an organochlorine insecticide, pollutes soils and
   contaminates crops and water resources and is biomagnified by food
   chains. As chlordecone is partly trapped in the soil, one possible
   alternative to decontamination may be to increase its containment in the
   soil, thereby reducing its diffusion into the environment. Containing
   the pesticide in the soil could be achieved by adding compost because
   the pollutant has an affinity for organic matter. We hypothesized that
   adding compost would also change soil porosity, as well as transport and
   containment of the pesticide. We measured the pore features and studied
   the nanoscale structure to assess the effect of adding compost on soil
   microstructure. We simulated changes in the transport properties
   (hydraulic conductivity and diffusion) associated with changes in
   porosity. During compost incubation, the clay microstructure collapsed
   due to capillary stresses. Simulated data showed that the hydraulic
   conductivity and diffusion coefficient were reduced by 95 and 70 \% in
   the clay microstructure, respectively. Reduced transport properties
   affected pesticide mobility and thus helped reduce its transfer from the
   soil to water and to the crop. We propose that the containment effect is
   due not only to the high affinity of chlordecone for soil organic matter
   but also to a trapping mechanism in the soil porosity.}},

Abstract = {{Rice-maize system (RMS) is emerging as dominant option for
   diversification of existing rice-wheat systems in Asia due to better
   suitability and higher yields of maize compared to wheat after long
   duration rice cultivars, and increasing demand of maize from poultry and
   fish industries. The conventional practice of cultivation of RMS is
   input intensive, deteriorates soil health and is less profitable.
   Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as dry
   direct-seeded rice (DSR), zero tillage (ZT) and residue retention may
   hold potential to increase yields, reduce costs and increase farmers'
   profits in RMS. Therefore, replicated 5-year field study was conducted
   to evaluate the effects of six combinations of three tillage and crop
   establishment (TCE) techniques and two residue management options on
   soil physical properties, system productivity and economics of an
   irrigated RMS in north-west India. The TCE techniques consisted of
   transplanted puddled rice (TPR) followed by conventionally tilled maize
   (CTM); CTDSR followed by CTM; and ZTDSR followed by ZTM in main plots
   and two residue management options; removal of residues of both the
   crops (-R) and partial residue (5 t ha(-1)) either retained at soil
   surface on ZT plots or incorporated into the soil in CT plots (+R) for
   both rice and maize in sub-plots. Compared with TPR/CTM-R, soil physical
   parameters such as water-stable aggregates >0.2 mm were 89\% higher, and
   bulk density, penetrometer resistance and infiltration rate showed
   significant (P < 0.05) improvement in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) treatment.
   Similarly, root mass density was 6 to 49\% greater in rice and 21 to
   53\% in maize under ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) plots compared to conventional RMS in
   different soil layers to 60 cm depth. The total amount of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) in 0-30 cm layer increased by 2.86 Mg ha(-1) in ZTDSR/ZTM
   (+R) over conventional practice. Grain yield of TPR was 5-7\% higher
   compared to CTDSR and ZTDSR, which was attributed to increased number of
   grains panicle(-1) and grain weight. Maize yield under ZTDSR/ZTM was
   significantly higher by 4.0\% and 14.2\% compared to CTDSR/CTM and
   TPR/CTM, respectively, due to increase in number of cobs plant(-1) and
   grain number cob(-1). Gradual improvement in soil physical health in
   ZTDSR/ZTM +R system resulted in higher and stable crop productivity
   (17.4-17.6 kg m(-3)) with higher profitability in different years over
   conventional system. Our study demonstrates that CA based management
   practices can be adopted for RMS on sandy loam or similar soils for
   sustaining soil and crop productivity in South Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Soil carbon is often cited as having potential to provide both climate
   change mitigation and adaptation benefits. Given the extensive ecosystem
   service benefits of soil organic matter (SOM), including increasing N
   supply and plant-available water-holding capacity (PAWHC), we
   hypothesized that on-farm benefits provide ample justification for
   maintaining high levels of SOM, separate to its carbon sequestration
   potential. To investigate this we used whole-farm system modelling to
   simulate pastures with high SOM (initial carbon amount similar to
   long-term pasture) and low SOM (initial carbon condition similar to
   long-term cropping). These scenarios are deliberately confounded with
   land use change, as this allowed for comparison of the mineralization,
   PAWHC, and associated productivity benefits on high and low carbon soils
   with the same management. Low-carbon soils were modelled with two
   amounts of PAWHC to investigate the importance of this effect in
   isolation. These three scenarios (one high carbon and two low carbon
   with differing PAWHC) were run for two climatic zones each with two soil
   types. Across both climatic zones and soil types, soil C accumulated at
   a rate of 0.30 0.48 t C ha(-1) year(-1) (0-30 cm) over the first 20
   years in soils with low initial carbon amounts. On soils in a
   high-rainfall climate, annual pasture production in low-SOM soil was
   590-900 kg DM ha(-1) less than for high-SOM soil, attributable primarily
   to increased N mineralization (68-77 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) overcoming an
   N limitation in spring. On low-rainfall sites, a reduction in annual
   pasture production of 290-810 kg DM ha(-1) on low carbon soils compared
   to high carbon soils was attributable to reduced PAWHC. The increased
   pasture production associated with higher SOM was valued between AUD 26
   and 95 ha(-1), across the soils and sites. The entire value on
   low-rainfall sites (AUD 26-85) was attributable to differences in PAWHC,
   while on high-rainfall sites, increased pasture production was
   attributed to N mineralization valued from AUD 85-105 ha(-1). These
   results indicate that soil carbon sequestration, through increased SOM,
   can provide substantial on-farm benefits that contribute to future
   productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},

Abstract = {{Soil application of organic waste products (OWP) can maintain or
   increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content, which in turn could lead to
   increased porosity and potentially to reduced energy use for soil
   tillage. Only a few studies have addressed the effect of SOC content on
   draught force for soil tillage, and this still needs to be addressed for
   fields that receive diverse types of organic waste of urban,
   agricultural and agro-industrial origin. The objective of this study was
   to determine the effect of changes in SOC induced by repeated soil
   application of OWP on draught force for soil tillage and tractor fuel
   consumption. Draught force was measured for tillage with conventional
   spring tillage tines, as well as bulk density, soil texture and SOC
   content in the CRUCIAL field experiment, Denmark in which diverse types
   of OWP had been applied annually for 11 years. The OWP included
   household waste compost, sewage sludge and cattle manure. The results
   showed that repeated waste application increased the SOC content from
   1.4\% SOC for the control NPK treatment to up to 3.5\% SOC for the
   compost applied at an accelerated rate. Bulk density was also changed by
   OWP additions and strongly correlated with SOC. Specific draught for
   soil tillage was significantly explained by SOC, clay content, bulk
   density and soil cohesion, and could be expressed as a linear function
   of SOC and clay content explaining 67\% of the variance. However, no
   evidence was found that the composition of SOC accumulated for different
   organic wastes influenced the specific draught. Overall, the decrease in
   draught force could lead to a decrease in tractor fuel consumption for
   soil tillage of up to 25\% for compost applied at an accelerated rate
   and up to 14\% for compost applied at a normal rate. This reduced fuel
   consumption could have a significant impact if taken into account in
   environmental assessments of organic waste recycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The research has been focused for the systematic examination and

   potential of five crop sequencing systems comprised
   `Pomegranate-Urd-Garlic' (P-U-G), `Pomegranate-Urd-Pea' (P-U-P),
   `Pomegranate-Turmeric' (P-T), `Pomegranate-Broccoli' (P-B) and
   `Pomegranate monoculture' (Pmono) under rainfed ecosystem has been
   demonstrated. After intercrop sequencing cycles, the essential relevant
   elements significantly improved growth attributes, physical, chemical
   and biological attributes of the rhizosphere soil compared to
   monoculture cropping practice. Maximum moisture content at field
   capacity (McFc, 24.9\%), water holding capacity (WHC, 33.3\%) and soil
   organic carbon (OC, 7.16 g kg(-1)) was recorded in P-U-P intercrop
   sequencing. This superior sequencing also recorded the available
   macronutrient contents (N, P, K), exchangeable Ca and Mg of soil which
   were increased by 8.15\%, 36.9\%, 8.6\%, 31.5\% and 22\%, respectively
   over Pmono. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable
   micronutrient cations (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) improved by 15.6\%, 23.2\%,
   28.7\% and 16.5\%, respectively. Microbial biomass carbon (MBc),
   microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and the plate count (colony-forming
   units, CFUs) of Bacillusspecies, Pseudomonasspecies, total soil fungi,
   Azotobacter chroococcumand actinobacteria exhibited significant
   variability. MBc and MBN ranged from 1723 to 255.9 mg kg(-1) and 12.1 to
   17.2 mg kg(-1), respectively. Microbial biomass of Pseudomonas species
   (116.5\%), Bacillusspecies (80.5\%), total soil fungi (204.4\%), A.
   chroococcum(219.6\%) and actinobacteria (205.6\%) improved significantly
   over Pmono. Correlation analysis of different attributes representing
   the chemical and biological properties of soil also resulted in a
   significant association at P< 0.05 attribute pairs. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) of soil quality attributes was also worked out to
   evaluate the differences induced among intercrop sequencing systems. The
   results inferred that PC4 accounted for 100\% of the total variance in
   all intercrop sequencing. Therefore, no correlation was observed between
   the soil properties, and the first, second and third PC (PC1, PC2, and
   PC3). It is expedient from the studies that the intercrop sequence
   systems have effects on soil fertility indicators and has the
   implications for agricultural productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Burley tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum L.) production in Kentucky is
   typically tillage intensive and is often mono-cropped. Intensive tillage
   has been reported to degrade soil structure and deplete soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks. This study assessed
   the effect of tillage, crop rotation, and N fertilizer application on
   soil structure, water-stable aggregation, and aggregate-associated SOC
   and TSN concentrations and stocks for rotations including burley
   tobacco. Four burley tobacco production systems (main plots) were
   established in 2007 on a Bluegrass-Maury (fine, mixed, active, mesic
   Typic Paleudalf) silt loam soil including: (i) no-tillage continuous
   tobacco (NT-Tobacco); (ii) conventional tillage continuous tobacco
   (CT-Tobacco); (iii) 2-yr sod (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) 1-yr
   no-tillage tobacco (NT-Rotation); (iv) 2-yr sod and 1-yr conventional
   tillage tobacco (CT-Rotation). In 2012, two N rates (0 and 280 kg N
   ha(-1)) were applied to split plots. Soil samples were taken in Spring
   2013 to determine water-stable aggregate-size distributions and
   associated SOC and TSN concentrations and stocks. Compared with
   conventional tillage and tobacco monoculture, notillage and rotation
   with sod significantly increased macroaggregate fractions (>250 mu m),
   and associated SOC and TSN stocks at the expense of the silt-clay size
   class (<53 mu m) and associated SOC and TSN stocks. Although previous
   fertilizer N application had no significant effect on whole-soil SOC and
   TSN stocks, a significant interaction with crop rotation on
   macroaggregate distribution and macroaggregate-associated SOC and TSN
   stocks was observed. Using NT and/or rotation practices in burley
   tobacco production maintains desirable soil physical and chemical
   properties via macroaggregate stabilization, which leads to the
   conservation of SOC and TSN stocks.}},

   degrees C. HZCs were analyzed for their elemental composition, NMR
   structural properties, thermogravimetric behavior, N-2 adsorption
   porosity, and scanning electron microscopy morphology. The results
   indicate distinct catalytic effects of zeolite on carbonization. For
   digestate, catalytic effects of zeolite increased the degree of
   carbonization equally to a 9-29 K higher HTC temperature. Zeolite
   increased the energy and carbon recovery in solid products for
   digestate, whereas MCC showed a lower recovery. Interestingly, zeolite
   preserved the cellulose fraction of digestate. This was attributed to
   physical and chemical shielding by formation of a visible zeolite layer
   on organic particles. Compared to pure hydrochar, the HZCs showed less
   aromatic and thermally stable carbon but higher surface area and pore
   volume. Potential areas of applications for the HZCs range from

   rainy and dry seasons using a gravitational bottom sampler. One sample
   was collected from the centre of the river and two samples were
   collected on the river edges, 5 m away from each bank. Sediments were
   divided into three size classes of water-stable aggregates by wet
   sieving, including macroaggregates, microaggregates and silts. The total
   organic carbon (TOC), labile organic carbon (LOC), total nitrogen (TN)
   and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) were measured to analyse the
   dynamic features of organic carbon in the sediments.
   The preservation of organic carbon in the sediments collected from the
   main stream decreased with an increase in distance from the Manwan dam,
   while it remained consistently high in the tributaries. The majority of
   the sediments collected during the rainy season preserved more TOC and
   TN than the samples collected during the dry season. Because of the
   increase in the proportion of sands in macroaggregates and
   microaggregates, the TOC contents decreased. In contrast, silts and
   clays were not affected and performed well in protecting organic carbon.
   The sediments in the lacustrine area and forepart of the transition
   area, with lower delta C-13 and higher C/N values, suggested a mixture
   of aquatic and agro-ecosystem inputs and led to high proportions of LOC
   in TOC.
   Dam construction reinforced the carbon sink and role of physical
   protection in the Manwan reservoir by enhancing fine fraction deposition
   and organic carbon inputs, especially during the rainy season. The
   sediments dominated by silts and clays absorbed and preserved more
   organic carbon than the samples dominated by sands. The majority of the
   organic carbon buried in the lacustrine area, the forepart of the
   transition area and the tributaries was protected by microaggregates,
   silts and clays. With the development of fisheries and agriculture,
   increasing amounts of labile organic carbon buried in sediments may lead
   to an increase in the potential for carbon mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has contributed substantially to the
   increase in food production, but has come at the expense of soil
   degradation and environmental problems. Management of soil based
   ecosystem services need to be considered in agricultural management
   since intensive management implies not only costs to the farmer but also
   to society. In this study we used data from four long-term (55 years)
   agricultural experiments in southern Sweden to assess the effects of two
   arable farming systems on a range of indicators of soil ecosystem
   services. One farming system used only annual commodity crops (ACC
   system) while the other integrated one year of ley (ley system) into the
   crop rotation. Nitrogen (N) fertiliser was applied annually in both
   farming systems at two rates (0 and 150 kg N ha(-1)). The ley farming
   system had an addition of farmyard manure (FYM) once every fourth year.
   Soil organic carbon, total N, phosphorous, potassium, pH and water
   holding capacity were used as indicators of regulating services;
   bacterial and fungal biomass were used as indicators of supporting
   services; grain yield and protein content were used as indicators of
   provisioning services. We analysed each of the indicators separately, to
   identify effects of the farming systems, using linear mixed effects
   models. In addition, we used principal components analysis to bundle the
   individual indicators together to create latent variables representing
   categories of ecosystem services. Yields of wheat were greatest in the
   plots that received N fertiliser, irrespective of farming system, while
   mycorrhizal fungal biomass was greatest in the ley system with no
   inorganic N fertiliser. The rest of the indicators were similar in both
   farming systems although the lowest values of all ecosystem service
   indicators were found in the ACC system with no N fertiliser. When
   bundling the indicators, no trade-offs were found between regulating,
   supporting and provisioning services. Regulating and supporting services
   were positively correlated, as were regulating and provisioning
   services. The ley system with N fertiliser had significantly greater
   values of regulating and provisioning services relative to the other
   treatments. The results indicate that different farming systems can have
   large effects on ecosystem service flows, and that integrating leys into
   arable rotations can enhance the delivery of soil ecosystem services.

Abstract = {{Soil structure has been destroyed due to long-term application of
   inorganic fertilizer in the Loess Plateau of China. Our objective was to
   determine how incorporation of three different rates of maize (Zea mays
   L) straw affected soil aggregate size and stability within the top 30 cm
   of arid soil on the Loess Plateau of China to provide basic theory of
   land utilization. Three rates of maize straw (4.5, 9.0, or 13.5 Mg
   ha(-1), hereafter referred to as LS, MS, and HS) were incorporated with
   255 and 90 kg/ha of inorganic N and P fertilizer, respectively, 2 times
   in a 4-year field experiment. Water stability of five aggregate size
   classes (>5, 2-5,1-2, 0.5-1, and 0.25-0.5 mm) in the 0-10,10-20, and
   20-30 cm depth increments was measured 3 times for each treatment and a
   check (CK) that received only the inorganic fertilizers. Incorporation
   of 13.5 Mg ha(-1) of straw significantly increased water stability of
   three aggregate classes (>5, 1-2, 0.5-1 mm) compared with CK and LS
   treatments within the surface 10 cm and for aggregates >0.5 mm in the
   10-20 cm depth increment. Within the 20-30 cm depth increment
   water-stablity of aggregates in the 0.25-0.5 mm class increased
   significantly as the rate of straw incorporation increased. Overall,
   aggregate stability was primarily increased through changes in
   microaggregate size distribution, especially for aggregate classes >5,
   0.5-1, 0.25-0.5 mm within the 0-10,10-20, 20-30 cm soil depth,

Abstract = {{Investigations of diurnal and seasonal variations in soil respiration
   support modeling of regional CO2 budgets and therefore in estimating
   their potential contribution to greenhouse gases. This study quantifies
   temporal changes in soil respiration and their driving factors in
   grassland and arable soils located in Northern Germany. Field
   measurements at an arable site showed diurnal mean soil respiration
   rates between 67 and 99 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) with a hysteresis effect
   following changes in mean soil temperatures. Field soil respiration
   peaked in April at 5767 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1), while values below 300 mg
   CO2 m(-2) day(-1) were measured in wintertime. Laboratory incubations
   were carried out in dark open flow chambers at temperatures from 5
   degrees C to 40 degrees C, with 5 degrees C intervals, and soil moisture
   was controlled at 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% of full water holding capacity.
   Respiration rates were higher in grassland soils than in arable soils
   when the incubating temperature exceeded 15 degrees C. The respiration
   rate difference between them rose with increasing temperature. Monthly
   median values of incubated soil respiration rates ranged from 0 to 26.12
   and 0 to 7.84 mu g CO2 g(-1) dry weight h(-1), respectively, in
   grassland and arable land. A shortage of available substrate leads to a
   temporal decline in soil respiration rates, as indicated by a decrease
   in dissolved organic carbon. Temporal Q(10) values decreased from about
   4.0 to below 1.5 as temperatures increased in the field. Moreover, the
   results of our laboratory experiments confirmed that soil temperature is
   the main controlling factor for the Q(10) values. Within the temperature
   interval between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, Q(10) values were around
   2 while the Q(10) values of arable soils were slightly lower compared to
   that of grassland soils. Thus, laboratory studies may underestimate
   temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, awareness for transforming
   laboratory data to field conditions must therefore be taken into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale railway/highway construction in hilly areas in China has
   created a number of bare rock cut slopes. Artificial soil is often
   sprayed onto those slopes to promote revegetation. The artificial soil
   used is a mixture of backfill soil, humus, straws, soluble chemical
   fertilizer, composite material and plant seeds. The backfill soil is the
   most important component of the artificial soil. Knowledge of the
   changes in the artificial soil quality induced by backfill soil is
   important for the management of the revegetation of rock cut slopes.
   This study was conducted to assess the effects of different backfill
   soils on soil quality parameters and slope restoration parameters,
   including the particle size distribution, water-stable aggregates, soil
   organic carbon (SOC), organic carbon fractions, soil water
   characteristics (SWC), plant coverage, Margalef index and Shannon-Wiener
   diversity index. In experiment one, the treatments included slopes
   backfilled with rock fragment (RF), slopes backfilled with agricultural
   soil (AS) and a natural slope (NS). In experiment two, the treatments
   were experiment plots with different proportions of agricultural soil to
   rock fragments. Soils were sampled from the surface layer (0-5 cm) of
   the slopes. The results indicated that the backfill soil significantly
   affected the soil structure. RF increased the percentage of large
   particles (>0.25 mm) and decreased that of microparticles (<0.25 mm).
   The fractal dimension and the water-stable aggregate content of RF were
   smaller than those of AS. Moreover, RF exhibited the highest soil
   destruction rate of soil aggregates among the three treatments. Our
   findings also indicate that RF conserved a smaller percentage of SOC in
   less degraded forms (coarse and fine particulate organic matter (POM)
   fractions) than AS management. At almost all of the soil suctions
   studied, AS retained more volumetric water content (theta(v)) than RF or
   NS. The AS soil contained 17.3\% more plant available water (PAW) than
   the RF soil. The plant coverage, Margalef index and Shannon-Winner were
   investigated to evaluate the restoration of the rock cut slopes compared
   with natural slopes. The three parameters of the RF were all smaller
   than those of the AS and NS. Overall, RF exhibited poorer soil structure
   and hydrological properties, increasing the risk of surface runoff and
   soil erosion because it had not undergone sufficient soil-forming
   processes and lacked SOC. Therefore, the use of rock fragments as
   backfill soil was not helpful for maintaining artificial soil with
   sufficiently high quality for the slope revegetation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Agricultural management plays an important role in the storage of carbon

   incubation experiments were performed for a period of 150 days to
   conduct this study. Soil CO2 flux, under no-tillage and tillage
   treatments, was observed to be 0.557 and 0.616 gCO(2)-C m(-2) d(-1),

   observed to be higher than that under no-tillage treatment, but no
   distinct difference in the soil carbon stock was observed between both
   treatments. The soil CO2 concentration under no-tillage treatment was
   clearly much higher than that under tillage treatment, except at a depth
   of 2.5 cm. Tillage decreased soil dry bulk density and enhanced soil
   air-filled porosity. Soil gas diffusivity, which depends on air-filled
   porosity, was increased by tillage at a depth of 0-15 cm, which
   contributed to their lower soil CO2 concentration. CO2 flux through the
   soil profile, calculated from the CO2 concentration, decreased with
   depth. Compared to the deep soils, the surface soil (0-5 cm) showed
   greater variation in CO2 flux. The CO2 production at depths of 0-10 cm
   accounted for 62.2 and 51.7 \% of the whole CO2 production of the
   0-30-cm soil profile for no-tillage and tillage treatments. CO2

Abstract = {{Cultivated land has increased in Chile as a result of a process in which

   process had an intermediate step in which sclerophyll species were
   replaced by Acacia caven, prior to cattle grazing. This land use change
   presents environmental impacts resulting from carbon losses of
   ecosystems. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate
   the effect of A. caven on the physical properties of soil. The study was
   conducted in two sites of central Chile (Pirque and Penuelas). Soil
   samples were taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm with and without A.
   caven cover. Organic matter, bulk density, pore size distribution and
   aggregate stability were evaluated. A marked difference was found in
   terms of depth in both study sites, also observing a process of
   densification of the subsurface horizon. A. caven cover has beneficial
   effects on the soil because it produces increased organic matter,
   decreased bulk density, and a higher proportion of coarse pores compared
   to soils without A. caven. However, available water holding capacity was
   higher in the site that had no influence of A. caven in Pirque. A. caven
   cover also promotes less mechanical resistance and higher structural
   stability, so that it is a good alternative to specific site protection

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{340-350}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{High methane (CH4) fluxes emitted from paddy fields strongly contribute
   to the accumulation of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
   compromising the eco-compatibility of one of the most important world
   foods. A strong link exists between infiltration rates of irrigation
   water and CH4 emissions. Since depth to the groundwater table affects
   infiltration rates, a relevant groundwater impact is expected on CH4
   emissions from paddy fields. In this work, a theoretical approach is
   adopted to investigate the aquifer effect on CH4 dynamics in paddies.
   Infiltration rates are strongly affected by the development of different
   connection states between aquifer and irrigation ponded water. A strong
   reduction in infiltration rates results from a water table near to the
   soil surface, when the system is hydraulically connected. When the
   groundwater level increases, the infiltration rate reduction due to the
   switch from disconnected to connected state promotes a relevant increase
   of CH4 emissions. This is due to a strong reduction of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) percolation, which leads to higher DOC availability for
   microbial CH4 production and, consequently, higher CH4 emissions. Our
   simulations show that CH4 fluxes can be reduced by up to 24\% when
   groundwater level is decreased and the aquifer is disconnected from
   ponding water. In paddies with shallow aquifers, lowering the water
   table with a drainage system could thus represent a promising CH4
   mitigation option. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   93.62; P = 45.64), followed by homegarden (C = 482.22; N = 91.16; P =

   nitrogen loss was intense at surface soil (0 to 10 cm) in forest (ca.
   121 \%), followed by agriculture (ca. 90 \%) and home garden (ca. 63 \%)
   systems. Similarly, over all nutrient loss was greatest in forest,
   agriculture and home garden when compared to grassland and plantations.
   Soil dehydrogenase activity was greater after the flood at both 0 - 10
   cm and 10 - 20 cm soil depths. In the top 0 - 10 cm soil, loss of
   microbial biomass C after flood was over 100 \% in home garden (ca. 106
   \%), and below 70 \% in the other landuse systems studied. Nonetheless,
   the loss of microbial biomass was severe at sub-surface (10 - 20 cm)
   soil in all the landuse systems. The contribution of microbial biomass N
   to soil total N pool increased in the surface soil as compared to the
   sub-surface soil during post-flood conditions. Amongst microbial-C and
   nutrients, the loss of microbial N was low (<= 50 \%) in all the landuse
   systems when compared to microbial C and P.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the adsorption of triazine herbicides and several reference
   heteroaromatic amines from water onto a temperature series of hardwood
   biochars (300-700 degrees C, labeled B300-B700). Adsorption on biochars
   correlated poorly with pyrolysis temperature, H/C, O/C, mean minimum
   fused ring size, surface area (N-2 or CO2), microporosity, and
   mesoporosity, but correlated well with a weighted sum of microporosity
   and mesoporosity. Steric effects were evident by the negative influence
   of solute molecular volume on adsorption rate. For a given compound,
   adsorption rate maximized for the biochar with the greatest
   mesoporosity-to-total-porosity ratio, suggesting that mesopores are
   important for facilitating diffusion into pore networks. The cationic
   forms of amines adsorb more slowly than the neutral forms. To further
   probe steric and electronic effects, adsorption on a biochar (B400) was
   compared to adsorption on graphite-a nonporous reference material with
   an unhindered, unfunctionalized graphene surface-and in comparison with
   reference compounds (benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, quinoline and
   1,3-triazine). Relative to benzene, the surface area-normalized
   adsorption of the triazine herbicides was disfavored on B400 (favored on
   graphite) by 11-19 kJ/mol, depending on concentration. It is estimated
   that steric suppression of B400 adsorption comprises 6.2 kJ/mol of this
   difference, the remainder being the difference in polar electronic
   effects. Based on the behavior of the reference amines, the difference
   in polar effects is dominated by pi-pi electron donor -acceptor (EDA)
   interactions with sites on polyaromatic surfaces, which are more
   electropositive and/or more abundant on graphite. Overall, our results
   show that mesoporosity is critical, that adsorption rate is a function
   of solute molecular size and charge, that steric bulk in the solute
   suppresses equilibrium adsorption, and that pi-pi EDA forces play a role
   in triazine polar interactions with biochar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This investigation examines nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from soil with
   simultaneous amendments of anaerobic digestates and biochar. The main
   source of anthropogenic emissions of N2O is agriculture and in
   particular, manure and slurry application to fields. Anaerobic
   digestates are increasingly used as a fertiliser and interest is growing
   in their potential as sources of N2O via nitrification and
   denitrification. Biochar is a stable product of pyrolysis and may affect
   soil properties such as cation exchange capacity and water holding
   capacity. Whilst work has been conducted on the effects of biochar
   amendment on N2O emissions in soils fertilised with mineral fertilisers
   and raw animal manures, little work to date has focused on the effects
   of biochar on nitrogen transformations within soil amended with
   anaerobic digestates. The aim of the current investigation was to
   quantify the effects of biochar application on ammonification,
   nitrification and N2O fluxes within soil amended with three anaerobic
   digestates derived from different feedstocks. A factorial experiment was
   undertaken in which a sandy loam soil (Dunnington Heath series) was
   either left untreated, or amended with three different anaerobic
   digestates and one of three biochar treatments; 0\%, 1\% or 3\%. Nitrous
   oxide emissions were greatest from soil amended with anaerobic digestate
   originating from a maize feedstock. Biochar amendment reduced N2O
   emissions from all treatments, with the greatest effect observed in
   treatments with maximum emissions. The degree of N2O production and
   efficacy of biochar amelioration of gas emissions is discussed in
   context of soil microbial biomass and soil available carbon. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Use of biochar has multiple benefits like C, soil organic matter
   stabilization, and agricultural productivity. However, there is limited
   information about the effect of biochar onPdynamics in acidic soils.
   Hence, we investigated the effects of fresh and aged hydrothermal coal
   produced from bark (HTC) and low temperature coal synthesized from
   sewage sludge (LTC) on the kinetics ofPadsorption in a Ferralsol. The
   treatments comprised of a control, compost {[}7.7g(kgsoil)(-1)],
   hydrothermal carbonization coal {[}HTC, 2g(kgsoil)(-1)], low temperature
   conversion coal {[}LTC, 3.8g(kgsoil)(-1)], lime {[}0.3gCaO

   {[}3.8 + 1.9g(kgsoil)(-1), respectively], compost + lime {[}7.6 and
   0.4g(kgsoil)(-1), respectively]. The soil samples were incubated for a
   period of 3 months at 60\% of the maximum water holding capacity. After
   5d and 3 months of the incubation period soil pH, Ca-acetate lactate
   (CAL) extractable soil-P, and P-adsorption isotherms were determined.
   The results show a significant effect of treatments on soil pH just
   after 5 d, which remained consistent after three months of incubation.
   All treatments, except HTC increased the soil pH compared with the
   control treatment. The maximum increase in soil pH was observed with
   compost + lime (from 4.5 to 6.1). The CAL-extractable Pwas significantly
   increased with application of LTC, compost + LTC, and compost + lime.
   The sorption parameters were not affected after 5d of incubation. Due to
   residence effects, thePsorption capacity (S-m) was significantly reduced
   in the LTC treatment {[}from 1182 to 1099mg(kgsoil)(-1)], and in the
   combination treatments compost + HTC {[}from 1182 to1078mg(kgsoil)(-1)],
   and compost + LTC {[}from 1182 to 1099mg(kgsoil)(-1)] treatments.
   ThePbinding energy (K) was significantly increased by the addition of
   LTC (from 2.18 to 4.26mgL(-1)), lime (from 2.18 to 4.53mgL(-1)), compost
   + HTC (from 2.18 to 7.03mgL(-1)) and compost + LTC (from 2.18 to
   4.68mgL(-1)). Based on the results of the present study it is concluded
   that alone application of biochars do not alter thePbioavailability and
   sorption in a Ferralsol. However, combined application of biochars along
   with compost significantly decreasesPsorption and increases
   bioavailability.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined properties of soil and runoff water under different
   land uses: forestry, pasture, cropping and fallow. The moisture level
   was found higher in the forest soil, while fallow and pasture soils
   showed a similar level of moisture. In top soil, the water holding
   capacity of pasture and forest soils was higher than other soils,
   especially that under cropping; the sub-soil held more water (12.1 \%)
   than the top soil (10.3 \%). The lower moisture level in cultivated or
   fallow lands could be attributed to the lower soil organic matter.
   Carbon concentration in the soils varied in the order forest > pasture >
   fallow > crop land. Across land uses, the concentrations of cations
   differed in the order: Ca > Mg > Na > K. Relatively higher
   concentrations of nutrients and lower pH were obtained in the top soil
   and sub-soil of the forest land. Forest and pasture catchments showed
   lower Na in soil. Regression analysis showed higher correlation between
   soil carbon and soil moisture, water holding capacity and nutrients. The
   nutrients concentrations were higher in forest soil and lowest in the
   soils of fallow and agricultural lands. The cations in the runoff water
   varied in the order Ca > Mg > Na > K, being highly consistent with that
   in the soil in each land use. Calcium concentrations in the runoff
   varied in the order forest > pasture > crop > fallow. Magnesium
   concentration was higher in forest runoff than other land uses, whereas
   higher K concentration was in pasture runoff. Higher total solids in the

Abstract = {{Historical agriculture and contemporary disturbances such as fire can
   each affect soil properties, but the relative impact of their separate
   and combined effects is poorly understood. We investigated the effects
   of historical agriculture and contemporary fire frequency on soil
   properties of longleaf pine woodlands in the Southeastern United States.
   We sampled 24 pairs of sites from adjacent former agricultural and
   remnant longleaf pine woodlands based on high (>= four since 1971) and
   low (< four since 1971) fire frequency. We found no evidence for
   interactive effects between agricultural history and fire frequency on
   measured mineral soil properties, yet each disturbance independently
   affected different aspects of the soil. Effects of past agricultural use
   were most apparent in the top 15 cm of the mineral soil, with
   post-agricultural woodlands characterized by increased phosphorus and
   bulk density, as well as decreased organic matter and soil water holding
   capacity, compared to remnant woodlands. Some effects of past
   agricultural use, such as increased phosphorus, were also apparent as
   deep as 30 cm into the soil profile. However, when expressed as stocks
   (to account for differences in bulk density) we found that organic
   matter content was similar among post-agricultural and remnant
   woodlands. With respect to contemporary fire frequency, less frequently
   burned sites had thicker O-horizons (litter and duff layers) and showed
   a trend of greater inorganic nitrogen in mineral soil, relative to
   frequently burned sites. Overall, our results indicate that agricultural
   legacies in soils persist 60 years after agricultural abandonment and
   have impacts that may extend deep into the soil profile. Fire
   suppression additionally affects soils, resulting in additive effects of
   historical and contemporary disturbances. Additional research is needed
   to better determine if and how the combined effects of past and present
   disturbances will affect ecological systems. These combined and
   long-lasting impacts of historical and contemporary disturbances may
   help explain why restoration of native understory vegetation remains
   challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Determination of the relationship between FAS values and energy

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{444-450}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we define the relationship between the FAS values of
   mixtures and their energy consumption in the composting process.
   Composting is the process of decomposing organic wastes by
   microorganisms under aerobic conditions. The resulting compost can be
   used in agriculture as a soil conditioner or manure to prevent erosion,
   and in forests and landscaping. The composting process requires external
   energy to provide adequate aerobic conditions. The largest use of energy
   in the composting process is for fans that blow air to the piles. The
   FAS value indicates the air-filled porosity in materials to be
   composted. A predetermined optimal FAS value should be ensured for
   oxygen supply to the composting mixtures during the composting process
   and to decrease the amount of the energy consumed by the fans. An
   increase in the FAS value decreases the air resistance in compost
   masses. While very high FAS values cause cooling of the masses by
   increasing heat transfer, very low FAS values increase the air
   transition resistance and causes a failure in the ventilation.
   Determining the optimal FAS value for the composting process increases
   its success and decreases energy consumption, and thus contributes to
   its environmental and economic sustainability.
   In the present study, chicken manure and sawdust were used for
   composting. Pine cones were added to adjust the FAS ratio of the
   mixtures. Pine cones have large clearance volumes and are good bulking
   agents; they facilitate the composting process without being decomposed.
   Experiments were performed in 5 compost reactors and different FAS
   values were obtained in each reactor. At the end of the experiments, the
   process temperatures, CO2/O-2 concentrations, moisture and volatile
   solids contents, and energy consumption values of the fans were
   evaluated. The composting process was most successful in the R10 and R15
   mixtures with FAS values in the range of 30-32\%. The lowest energy
   consumption was obtained in the mixture with a FAS value of 34\%; the
   temperature in this reactor did not increase, and the organic matter
   loss was low. When the FAS value decreased below 30\%, the effectiveness
   of the process was negatively affected, whereas the energy consumption
   increased.
   According to the results, when composting mixtures of chicken manure and
   sawdust, pine cones can be used as bulking agents. It has been
   determined that when 15\% pine cones are added to the compost mixture,
   the success of the process increases, and the energy consumption of the
   system decreases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quality of agricultural soils is influenced by different management
   practices. The purpose of conducting on-farm field research is to come
   up with fact-based answers to farming's challenging questions and this
   type of research targets ``real world{''} data that are typically more
   variable than smaller fields used for small-plot/small-scale research.
   Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the immediate (one
   year) impacts of pea (Pisum sativum) and turnip (Brassica rapa rapa) as
   cover crops on properties of a Kokomo silty clay loam soil (Fine, mixed,
   superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls) in Central Ohio under on-farm
   conditions. A range of soil parameters were tested for soil sampled from
   four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) after the first season of
   cover cropping and before seeding of soybean (Glycine max) in 2013. Data
   indicate that only few soil parameters were significantly affected by
   the cover crop treatment. For 0-10 cm depth, cover crops significantly
   decreased pH from 6.7 to 5.7 and increased soil organic C (SOC)
   concentrations from 23 to 2.5\% (g 100 g(-1)). Although cover crops did
   not have any significant effects on other soil properties, however,
   there were trends of lower field dry bulk density (BD) and water stable
   aggregates (WSA) in 0-10 cm depth under the cover cropping system (BD:
   13 Mg m(-3), WSA: 72\%) than those of control (BD: 1.5 Mg m(-3), WSA:
   80\% in 0-10 cm), and similar observations were found for deeper soil
   layers. The lack of significant effects on other soil properties may be
   due to high field variability and short duration under cover cropping.
   Similarly, soybean grain yield was not significantly impacted by the
   treatment but yield was slightly higher under cover crop (4.6 Mg ha(-1))
   than under control (4.3 Mg ha(-1)). These data suggest that some
   improvements in soil characteristics are likely even over a short period
   under an appropriate cover crop, however, longer-term data are needed to
   see whether or not these trends are transient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Growing cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) in an agroforestry system generates a
   productive use of the land, preserves the best conditions for physical,
   chemical and biological properties of tropical soils, and plays an
   important role in improving cacao production and fertility of degraded
   tropical soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two
   long term agroforestry systems of cacao management on soil physical and
   chemical properties in an area originally inhabited by 30 years old
   native secondary forest (SF). The two agroforestry systems adapted were:
   improved natural agroforestry system (INAS) where trees without economic
   value were selectively removed to provide 50\% shade and improved
   traditional agroforestry system (ITAS) where all native trees were cut
   and burnt in the location. For evaluation of the changes of soil
   physical and chemical properties with time due to the imposed cacao
   management systems, plots of 10 cacao genotypes (ICS95, UF613, CCN51,
   ICT1112, ICT1026, ICT2162, ICT2171, ICT2142, H35, U30) and one plot with
   a spontaneous hybrid were selected. Soil samples were taken at 0-20,
   20-40 and 40-60 cm depths before the installation of the management
   systems (2004), and then followed at two years intervals. Bulk density,
   porosity, field capacity and wilting point varied significantly during
   the years of assessment in the different soil depths and under the
   systems assessed. Soil pH, CEC, exchangeable Mg and sum of the bases
   were higher in the INAS than the ITAS. In both systems, SOM, Ext. P, K
   and Fe, exch. K, Mg and Al+H decreased with years of cultivation; these
   changes were more evident in the 0-20 cm soil depth. Overall improvement
   of SOM and soil nutrient status was much higher in the ITAS than INAS.
   The levels of physical and chemical properties of soil under cacao
   genotypes showed a marked difference in both systems.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that farmers' hold important knowledge of folk
   soil classification for agricultural land for its uses, yet little has
   been studied for traditional agroforestry systems. This article explores
   the ethnopedology of bamboo (Bambusa sp.) based agroforestry system in
   North East India, and establishes the relationship of soil quality index
   (SQI) with bamboo productivity. The study revealed four basic folk soil
   (mati) types: kalo (black soil), lal (red soil), pathal (stony soil) and
   balu (sandy soil). Of these, lal mati soil was the most predominant soil
   type (similar to 40\%) in bamboo-based agroforestry system. Soil
   physio-chemical parameters were studied to validate the farmers' soil
   hierarchal classification and also to correlate with productivity of the
   bamboo stand. Farmers' hierarchal folk soil classification was
   consistent with the laboratory scientific analysis. Culm production
   (i.e. measure of productivity of bamboo) was the highest (27 culms
   clump(-1)) in kalo mati (black soil) and the lowest (19 culms clump(-1))
   in balu mati (sandy soil). Linear correlation of individual soil quality
   parameter with bamboo productivity explained 16 to 49\% of the
   variability. A multiple correlation of the best fitted linear soil
   quality parameter (soil organic carbon or SOC, water holding capacity or
   WHC, total nitrogen) with productivity improved explanatory power to
   53\%. Development of SQI from ten relevant soil quality parameters and
   its correlation with bamboo productivity explained the 64\% of the
   variation and therefore, suggest SQI as the best determinant of bamboo
   yield. Data presented indicate that the kalo mati (black soil) is
   sustainable or sustainable with high input. However, the other three
   folk soil types (red, stony and sandy soil) are also sustainable but for
   other land uses. Therefore, ethnopedological studies may move beyond
   routine laboratory analysis and incorporate SQI for assessing the
   sustainability of land uses managed by the farmers'. Additional research
   is required to incorporate principal component analysis for improving
   the SQI and site potential assessment. It is also important to evaluate
   the minimum data set (MDS) required for SQI and productivity assessment
   in agroforestry systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and stability require the
   separate assessment of soil fractions in relation to protection against
   loss. This on-farm study assessed the role of primary (sand, silt, and
   clay) and secondary (micro- and macroaggregates) particle size fractions
   on the physical protection of SOC to 30-cm depth of nine agricultural
   and three forest land uses within three contrasting ecoregions of Costa
   Rica (i.e., Isthmian-Atlantic moist, Pacific dry, and Montane forest).
   Specific objectives were to: (1) determine the effect of land use in
   each ecoregion on particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), silt plus
   clay-associated carbon (S+C-C), and micro- and macroaggregate associated
   water-stable aggregate carbon (WSA-C), and (2) establish the
   relationships among aggregate properties and SOC concentration.
   Aggregate stability was characterized by studying the WSA, mean weight
   diameter (MWD), and tensile strength (TS). Soils under coffee (Coffea
   arabica), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and pineapple (Ananas comosus)
   plantations had high clay contents to 30-cm depth (ranging between 42.9
   and 60.7\%), which indicated a high potential for SOC storage. In
   comparison to less disturbed forest soils, micro- and macroaggregation
   was not strongly affected by agricultural land use. At coffee and
   pasture land uses, POM-C concentration was significantly lower (ranging
   between 0.4 and 2.0 g C kg(-1)). Between 58 and 98\% of SOC was
   associated with S+C fractions indicating the importance of these
   particle size fractions to SOC storage. The S+C-C and micro- and
   macroaggregate-C concentrations differed mainly among pineapple, mango
   (Mangifera indica), pasture, and other land uses within ecoregions.
   Further, there was no general tendency of higher C concentrations in the
   macro- vs. the microaggregate fractions in contrast to the aggregate
   hierarchy theory. The MWD was affected by land use only for pineapple
   and organic farming, and it decreased for mango and coffee with increase
   in soil depth. Correlations among SOC, texture, and TS were
   site-specific. Silt content was more important than the other particle
   size fractions in explaining SOC contents. In summary, the amount of
   physically separated soil fractions and their C storage and stability to
   30-cm depth differed mainly among pineapple, mango, pasture, and coffee
   in specific ecoregions. Well-designed long-term field experiments in
   Costa Rica are needed to develop management practices for enhancing SOC
   storage and stabilization in physically separated soil fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of wheat
   and rice biochars on pyrazosulfuron-ethyl sorption in a sandy loam soil.
   Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was poorly sorbed in the soil (3.5-8.6\%) but
   biochar amendment increased the herbicide adsorption, and the effect
   varied with the nature of the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature.
   Biochars prepared at 600 degrees C were more effective in adsorbing
   pyrazosulfuron-ethyl than biochars prepared at 400 degrees C. Rice
   biochars were better than wheat biochars, and higher herbicide
   adsorption was attributed to the biochar surface area/porosity. The
   Freundlich constant 1/n suggested nonlinear isotherms, and nonlinearlity
   increased with increase in the level of biochar amendment. Desorption
   results suggested sorption of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was partially
   irreversible, and the irreversibility increased with increase in the
   level of biochar. Both sorption and desorption of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl
   correlated well with the content of biochars. The free energy change
   (Delta G) indicated that the pyrazosulfuron-ethyl sorption process was
   exothermic, spontaneous and physical in nature. Persistence studies
   indicated that biochar (0.5\%) amendment did not have significant effect
   on herbicide degradation, and its half-life values in the control, 0.5\%
   WBC600- and RBC600-amended rice planted soils were 7, 8.6, and 10.4days,

Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{For regions with shallow soils underlain by fractured parent rocks, it
   is important to understand the characteristics of soil water retention
   and hydraulic conductivity. This knowledge could support the development
   of strategies to manage water for crops. A farmland and a forestland
   with thin Entisols, located in hilly central Sichuan on the Yangtze
   River's upper reaches, were chosen as experimental fields. A variety of
   parameters related to hydraulically effective macroporosity (pore radius
   > 125 mu m), the single-porosity van Genuchten model, and the
   dual-porosity bi-exponential (BE) model for water retention
   characteristics were determined. Tension infiltration data showed that
   soil macropores were the main pores (accounting for 87.9-99.7\%)
   contributing to fast drainage at all tested soil depths under both land
   uses in the rainy summer, in spite of their very low percentage of the
   total porosity (0.61-3.06\%). The available soil water content,
   determined as the drainable soil textural porosity using the
   bi-exponential model (theta(txt-BE)), was found to be very low
   (0.032-0.091 m(3) m(-3)) and negatively (P < 0.05) related to the
   initial soil water content at the time of sampling, resulting in high
   vulnerability of the crops grown on the farmland to drought. Plowing
   operations and periodical drying appeared to be the two main factors
   controlling the within-year change in soil hydraulic properties. For
   agricultural soils showing a bimodal pore size distribution, the soil's
   capacity to hold crop-available water in textural pores, which may vary
   with the time of year, rather than the total soil water content should
   be analyzed to inform decisions on irrigation operations including
   required amounts.}},

Abstract = {{Corn (Zea mays L.) stover (non-grain aboveground biomass) in the US Corn
   Belt is used increasingly for livestock grazing and co-feed and for
   cellulosic bioenergy production. Continuous stover removal, however,
   could alter long-term agricultural productivity by affecting soil
   organic C (SOC) and soil physical properties, indicators of soil
   fertility and erosion potential. In this study, we showed that 12
   consecutive yr of 55\% stover removal did not affect mean grain yields
   at any N fertilizer rate (4.5, 6.3, and 6.0 Mg ha(-1) for 60, 120, and
   180 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) in a marginally productive,
   rainfed continuous corn system under no-till (NT). Although SOC
   increased in the top 30 cm of all soils since 1998 (0.54-0.79 Mg C
   ha(-1) yr(-1)), stover removal tended to limit SOC gains compared with
   no removal. Near-surface soils (0-5-cm depth) were more sensitive to
   stover removal and showed a 41\% decrease in particulate organic matter
   stocks, smaller mean weight diameter of dry soil aggregates, and lower
   abundance of water-stable soil aggregates compared with soils with no
   stover removal. Increasing N fertilizer rate mitigated losses in total
   water-stable aggregates in near-surface soils related to stover removal.
   Collectively, however, our results indicated soil structure losses in
   surface soils due to lower C inputs. Despite no effect on crop yields
   and overall SOC gains with time using NT management, annually removing
   stover for 12 yr resulted in a higher risk of wind and water erosion at
   this NT continuous corn site in the western Corn Belt.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{226}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Rhamnolipid is a biosurfactant produced by several Pseudomonas species,
   and can wet hydrophobic soils by lowering the cohesive and/or adhesive
   surface tension. Because of its biodegradability, rhamnolipid is
   believed to have minimal adverse impact on the soil and groundwater
   after usage. Applications of rhamnolipid to improve irrigation in
   agricultural soils thus have obvious advantages over other chemical
   wetting agents, especially under drought conditions. Due to global
   warming, soil amendment with biochar has been commonly practiced in
   agricultural soils to increase the soil water-holding capacity. As such,
   rhamnolipid transport in biochar-amended agricultural soils needs to be
   characterized. In this research, we found that rhamnolipid transport in
   biochar-amended agricultural soils was hindered by retardation
   (equilibrium adsorption) and deposition (kinetic adsorption), which was
   well represented by the advection-dispersion equation based on a local
   equilibrium assumption. A linear equilibrium adsorption was assumed in
   the advection-dispersion equation simulation, which was proved to be
   acceptable by studying the breakthrough curves. Both rhamnolipid
   equilibrium adsorption and kinetic adsorption increased with the
   increase of the biochar content in the agricultural soil.}},

Abstract = {{Soil aggregate stability (AS) is an important indicator of soil physical

   resistance to penetration by a water drop placed on the surface (WDPT

Abstract = {{Variation in soil moisture content can change metal availability.
   However, the effects of soil drying during wetting-drying cycles on
   metal availability have been little investigated. Metal availability to
   an imposed sink can be assessed by the diffusive gradients in thin film
   (DGT) technique. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate
   the effects of the soil drying processes and previous soil moisture
   contents on metal availability using DGT.
   Two metal-polluted agricultural soils with contrasting pH (one acid and
   one calcareous) were collected from agricultural fields and were
   repeatedly phytoextracted with a Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator. Both soils,
   with and without phytoextraction, were subjected to two soil drying
   processes, i.e. drying from flooded conditions to 50 \% maximum water
   holding capacity (WHC) and drying from 100 to 30 \% WHC. Changes in
   metal availability induced by changing soil water moisture were examined
   using DGT.
   In acid soils, the availability of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and nickel
   (Ni) (but not copper) increased with drying from saturation to 50 \%
   WHC. Drying soil from 100 to 30 \% WHC had weak or no significant
   effects on available metals. Availabilities of Cd, Ni and Zn correlated
   well with available Al for both drying conditions. In calcareous soil, a
   decreasing trend of metal availability with soil drying from saturation
   to 50 \% WHC or from 100 to 30 \% WHC was found. Soils were also
   subjected to different wetting-drying cycles prior to drying. In acid
   soil, available copper (Cu) was correlated with dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC). Available Cd, Ni and Zn were correlated with available Al and
   increased with soil wetting-drying cycles in phytoextracted soil, but
   not in non-remediated soil. In calcareous soil, available Cu and Ni were
   correlated well with DOC and were higher with long dry periods. However,
   available Cd and Zn were lower in soils dried from the cycle of
   saturation to 50 \% WHC.
   The results indicate that soil water regimes can be manipulated to
   alleviate soil metal availability, but they must be tailored to
   individual metals and different soil types, and soil moisture content
   before drying should be considered when dried soils are used for
   evaluation of metal availability.}},

   The SOC content in the plough layer tended to decrease under wheat and

Abstract = {{In the northern agroecosystem of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, cash crops

   traditional perennial crops like alfalfa. However, very little
   information is available on the relatively long-term effect of different
   crop rotations and soil tillage practices on crop yields and soil
   quality parameters. This study was conducted at the Normandin Research
   Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Five rotation types {[}1:
   Canola-Barley-Barley-Pea (C-B-B-P); 2: Canola-Pea-Barley-Barley
   (C-P-B-B); 3: Canola-Barley-Pea-Barley (C-B-P-B); 4: Pea monoculture;
   and 5: Barley monoculture] and two soil tillage practices {[}1: Chisel
   plough (CP) and 2; Moldboard plough (MP)] were evaluated. Canola
   monoculture of was not included. The study began in 1999 on a former
   alfalfa field and ended in 2010 after three four-year rotation cycles.
   Barley monoculture decreased yields by 600 kg ha(-1) in the last five
   years, whereas field pea monoculture decreased yields by about 1000 kg
   ha(-1) in most years. Barley monoculture did not significantly reduce
   grain yields compared to CB-B-P and C-P-B-B, highlighting the importance
   of alternate crops every year. Soil tillage (CP versus MP) did not
   significantly affect yields for all crops in most years; and when it did
   have an effect, it showed inconsistencies by either increasing or
   decreasing grain yields. Soil tillage also had insignificant impact
   regardless of the rotation type involved. Rotation type and soil tillage
   had insignificant effect on soil organic matter content, whereas CP
   increased nitrate and phosphorus content in the 0-20 cm soil layer.
   Rotation type had insignificant impact on soil physical properties,
   whereas CP improved soil water conductivity by 0.03 cm h(-1) for C-B-B-P
   and barley monoculture. Compared to MP, CP improved soil macro-aggregate
   (2-6 mm) stability to water as well as aggregate mean weight diameter by
   about 15\% for most of the rotations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   N accumulation in maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
   grown in a loam soil under greenhouse conditions. Treatments comprised
   of: untreated control; mineral N fertilizer (urea N, UN) at the rate of
   200, and 100 mg N kg(-1), white clover residues biochar (WCRB), poultry
   manure biochar (PMB) at 30 Mg ha(-1), and the possible combinations of
   WCRB+PMB (50:50), UN+WCRB (50: 50), UN+PMB (50:50), and UN+WCRB+PMB
   (50:25:25). The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized

   in the growth and biomass production of maize and wheat supplemented
   with biochars alone or mixed with N fertilizer. Biochars treatments
   showed varying impact on plant growth depended upon the type of the
   biochar, and in general plant growth under PMB was significantly higher
   than that recorded under WCRB. The growth characteristics in the
   combined treatments (half biochar+half N) were either higher or
   equivalent to that recorded under full fertilizer N treatment (N-200).

   treated with WCRB, PMB, and WCRB+PMB (50:50) was 54, 116, and 90 mg
   g(-1) compared to the 33 mg g(-1) in the control while the N-uptake by
   wheat was 41, 60, and 53 mg g(-1) compared to 24 mg g(-1) in the
   control. The mixed treatments (half biochar+half N) increased N-uptake
   by 2.3folds in maize and 1.7 to 2.5folds in wheat compared to the N-100
   showing increasing effect of biochar on N use efficiency of applied N.
   Post-harvest soil analysis indicated a significant increase in pH,
   organic matter, organic C, total N, C:N, and porosity (\% pore space) by
   the added biochars while bulk density (BD) was significantly decreased.
   The organic matter content in the soil amended with biochars ranged
   between 19.5 and 23.2 g kg(-1) compared to 11.7 and 10.2 g kg(-1) in the
   control and N fertilizer treatments while the BD of biochars amended
   soils (WCRB, PMB, and WCRB+PMB) was 1.07, 1.17, and 1.11 g cm(-3)
   compared to 1.28 g cm(-1) in the control. In summary, the results of
   present study highlight the agronomic benefits of biochars in improving
   the quality of the soil, and promoting growth, yield and N accumulation
   of both maize and wheat with a consequent benefit to agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Balanced and integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers may
   enhance the accumulation of soil organic matter and improves soil
   physical properties. A field experiment having randomized complete block
   design with four replications was conducted for 36 years at Punjab
   Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, India to assess the effects of
   inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon
   (SOC), soil physical properties and crop yields in a maize (Zea
   mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) rotation. Soil fertility management
   treatments included were non-treated control, 100\% N, 50\% NPK, 100\%
   NP, 100\% NPK, 150\% NPK, 100\% NPK + Zn, 100\% NPK + W, 100\% NPK (-S)
   and 100\% NPK + FYM. Soil pH, bulk density (BD), electrical conductivity
   (EC), cation exchange capacity, aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and
   infiltration were measured 36 years after the initiation of experiment.
   Cumulative infiltration, infiltration rate and aggregate MWD were
   greater with integrated use of FYM along with 100\% NPK compared to
   non-treated control. No significant differences were obtained among
   fertilizer treatments for BD and EC. The SOC pool was the lowest in
   control at 7.3 Mg ha(-1) and increased to 11.6 Mg ha(-1) with
   100\%NPK+FYM. Improved soil physical conditions and increase in SOC
   resulted in higher maize and wheat yields. Infiltration rate, aggregate
   MWD and crop yields were positively correlated with SOC. Continuous
   cropping and integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers
   increased soil C sequestration and crop yields. Balanced application of
   NPK fertilizers with FYM was best option for higher crop yields in
   maize-wheat rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Organic soils are an excellent substrate for commercial lettuce (Lactuca
   sativa L.) farming; however, drainage accelerates oxidation of the
   surface layer and reduces the water holding capacity, which is often
   lethal for crops that are sensitive to water stress. In this case study,
   we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex
   (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial
   and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer
   below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which
   the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed
   peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that
   bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden
   pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields
   were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on
   fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more
   samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity
   (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after
   2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC
   between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible,
   however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within
   even a year of reclamation. The results of this study call for active
   measures to reduce organic soil degradation such as reducing tillage and
   on-field traffic or following a crop rotation scheme.}},

   (Nicotiana tabacum L.) (TO) and tea (Camellia Sinensis (L.)) (TE) wastes
   based on hydraulic property improvement of a loamy sand cropland in
   Turkey. The effects of agricultural wastes on field capacity (FC),
   permanent wilting point (PWP), available water content (AWC), relative
   saturation (RS) and initial infiltration rate (IR) were determined for a
   loamy sand soil 7 months after agricultural wastes were incorporated to
   15cm soil depth at four different rates (0, 2\%, 4\% and 6\%,
   weight:weight) in a randomized plot design experiment with three
   replicates. While increases in soil OM content for the M application
   rates were generally lower, TE and HH treatments including high organic
   carbon (OC) contents resulted in high soil organic matter (OM)
   increases. Organic wastes generally increased the values of soil
   hydraulic properties, with increased aggregate stability (AS) and total
   porosity (F) and reduced bulk density (BD). The highest AS and F values
   were obtained with 6\% HH and 6\% TE applications, respectively. Due to
   different mineralization rates of the organic wastes attributable to
   their carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratios, the same application rate had
   different effects on the soil's hydraulic properties. Manure, having the
   lowest C:N ratio, generally had a lower effect on AS and BD. Increased
   IR due to increases in AS and F by the agricultural waste treatment,
   especially at 4 and 6\% HH, reduced the AW content to 15cm compared with
   2\% HH. This indicates that the significant application of higher C:N
   ratio wastes is not suitable in terms of AW, due to significant
   improvement of IR. While the highest FC (17.3\%) and AWC (10.7\%) values
   were found in the 6\% TE application, the highest PWP (7.2\%) and IR
   (333.4cmh(-1)) were in the 6\% TO and 6\% HH applications, respectively.
   To improve soil physical and hydraulic properties, 6\% TO and M, 4\% TE
   and 2\% HH applications are suggested for loamy sand cropland.}},

Abstract = {{Although conservation tillage is widely believed to be an agricultural
   management practice effective for increasing soil carbon (C) accretion
   and associated soil quality, there is limited research to determine
   whether conservation tillage increases net C accretion versus simply
   altering the distribution of C content by soil depth. We implemented
   conservation farming practices (winter cover cropping plus strip
   tillage) for a nonirrigated corn (Zea mays L.) production system in the
   southeastern coastal plain of Georgia, United States, that had been
   previously managed under a conventional plow and harrow tillage regime.
   Total soil C and nitrogen (N) were measured on samples collected from 0
   to 65 cm (0 to 25.6 in) at 57 sites before and after five years under
   conservation farming practices. Crop yield, winter and summer
   aboveground crop biomass production, and biomass C and N content were
   also measured annually at each site. Soil C increased an average of 20
   Mg ha(-1) (8.9 tn ac(-1); 6 to 62 Mg C ha(-1) {[}2.6 to 27.6 tn C
   ac(-1)], depending upon slope position) and was associated with a N
   increase of 2 Mg ha(-1) (0.89 tn ac(-1)). Although 72\% to 80\% of the C
   accretion was in the top 35 cm (13.8 in), 3 to 6 Mg C ha(-1) (1.3 to 2.6
   tn C ac(-1)) was accreted from 35 to 65 cm (13.8 to 25.6 in). The soil C
   accreted during the study amounted to 36\% of the net biomass C
   produced. Corn yield increased 2,200 kg ha(-1) (1,964 lb ac(-1))
   depending upon slope position (1,200 to 2,500 kg ha(-1) {[}1,071 to
   2,232 lb ac(-1)]) during the same time. Analysis indicated that soil C
   content from 15 to 35 cm (5.9 to 13.8 in) was the soil parameter
   primarily associated with corn yield. Season rainfall from planting to
   corn silking stage for both corn production years was the lowest in the
   past 45 years (20 to 25 cm {[}7.8 to 9.8 in] below the net crop demand)
   suggesting that soil C-mediated increase in plant-available soil water
   was a mechanism contributing to improved corn yield. Calculated
   estimates (from soil clay, sand, and C content) of increased soil water
   holding capacity suggest that C accretion in the top 35 cm (13.8 in) of
   soil potentially increased water storage enough to supply up to four
   days' worth of additional crop water demand. These results indicated
   that conservation farming practices can increase soil C and N accretion
   in degraded sandy soils of the humid southeastern United States coastal
   plain, and that increased soil C may potentially mitigate the
   deleterious effects of short-term rainfall deficits in nonirrigated
   production systems.}},

Abstract = {{Soils from central Brazil have been intensively used over the last
   decades because of the rapid conversion of savannas (Cerrado) into

   modifications in the physical properties of soils in the Rio Verde
   watershed, as a function of the land use time for agriculture,
   determined from classification of Landsat satellite images between 1980
   and 2010. Soil samples were collected at surface (0-20cm) and subsurface
   (20-40cm) horizons for the different classes of land use time (<10,
   10-20, 20-30, and >30years). The following physical properties were
   measured: bulk density (BD), air permeability (K-a), penetration
   resistance (PR), microporosity (MI), macroporosity (MA), and total
   porosity (TP). Results showed a strong expansion with time of
   agriculture that occupied 353\% (1980), 374\% (1990), 513\% (2000), and
   609\% (2010) of the watershed area. When properties were compared with
   those from the reference areas (preserved soils under native
   vegetation), significant differences were observed for all the physical
   attributes of soils for a land use time higher than 20years. Overall, BD
   and PR increased with land use time, and the opposite was verified for
   K-a, MA, and TP. Some physical properties presented values (e.g.,
   154gcm(-3) for BD and 0.06cm(3)cm(-3) for MA) close to the critical ones

Abstract = {{A thorough assessment of changes in soil quality associated with soil
   management practices is vital for the selection and establishment of
   sustainable agricultural management The winter wheat (Triticurn aestivum
   L)-maize (Zea mays L) double cropping system was used to study the
   integrated effects of a 9-year-old tillage coupled with fertilization on
   soil carbon sequestration and other physical properties in the Yellow
   River Delta (YRD). Three tillage systems were selected: no-tillage with.
   straw cover plus recommended urea nitrogen rate (NTS), no-tillage with
   straw removed and manure applied plus recommended urea nitrogen rate
   (NTM), and conventional tillage with straw removed plus conventional
   urea nitrogen application rate (CT). There were three replicates of each
   treatment organized in a randomized block design. NTS and NTM treatments
   were found to result in a slightly decrease in the soil bulk density
   (BD), and significantly increased the proportion of water stable
   aggregates (WSA) (>2 mm), as well as the water infiltration capacity.
   The proportion of water stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm), the mean
   weight diameter (MWD) and the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of
   aggregates in the 0-20 cm layer were unchanged by NTS and NTM. The total
   soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at a depth of 0-60 cm was not
   significantly different among the treatments. Both aggregate-associated
   SOC concentration and stocks (0-5 cm) were significantly greater for NTS
   and NTM compared with CT, while CT led to a greater OC accumulation in
   the 20-60 cm soil layer compared with NTS and in the 10-20 cm compared
   with NTM. The mesoaggregate fraction (2-0.25 mm) and its associated OC
   pool accounted for the highest percentages in the whole soil profile
   under the CT treatment The NT system was found to have a positive effect
   on the investigated soil physical properties and increase soil carbon
   content in the soil surface layer. The CT system in conjunction with the
   wheat-maize double cropping system, however, improved soil aggregation
   in the soil profile (0-60 cm) and also maintained a higher fraction of
   SOC in the subsoil compared with the NT systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Soil compaction has always been a problem to the agricultural
   productivity, mainly in clayey soils under the no-tillage (NT).
   Alternatives to mitigate this problem are necessary. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the effect of seeder equipped with fixed shanks
   openers, working at three depths, in a Ferralic Nitisol (Rhodic), under
   NT on the mitigation of soil compaction and corn (Zea mays L.) plant
   development. The test comprised three treatments regarding the depth at
   which the shank openers of a seeder used to sow corn worked: openers
   reaching up to 0.05 m; openers reaching up to 0.07 m; and openers
   reaching up to 0.17 m. The effect of these treatments was evaluated in
   relation to the determination of soil physical parameters, and corn
   plant parameters. The use of a seeder equipped with fixed shanks openers
   up to 0.17 m depth caused an increase in soil macroporosity and total
   porosity, and a decrease in soil bulk density, soil resistance to
   penetration and degree of compactness in the layer between 0.07 and 0.17
   m. The improved physical conditions of the soil in this layer led to a
   further development of the root system of plants in greater depth, and
   consequently to a better development of corn plants with higher stalk
   diameter, root density and root length. The use of a seeder equipped
   with fixed shanks openers working up to 0.17 m depth, therefore,
   promoted physical improvement to the soil, favoring the development of
   corn plants, and presenting potential to mitigate the compaction of
   clayey soils under NT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{More than a hundred abandoned but presently maintained fruit trees are
   scattered in the Negev Desert Highlands in Southern Israel. Most of the
   older groves were planted by Bedouins in pre-existing agricultural
   systems built in the distant past, mainly during the Byzantine era,
   mostly during the sixth and seventh centuries AD. In these groves a
   variety of domesticated fruit trees such as date palms, figs,
   pomegranates, almonds, carobs, pistachios, bitter oranges, grapevines
   and olives have been planted. The trees growing in these abandoned sites
   throughout the Negev Highland region are strictly rain-fed and dependent
   on the amount of runoff water accumulating from the surrounding old
   runoff harvesting systems with no modern artificial irrigation at least
   for the past several decades. Despite the lack of active irrigation,
   some of the trees of all species continue to flourish and even persist
   in bearing fruit to this day. The trees growing in the Negev Highlands
   can be divided into several planting periods. The oldest olive trees are
   apparently descendants of trees planted in the area during the Byzantine
   period (sixth and seventh centuries AD), while the youngest consist of
   varieties and species recently planted by Bedouins, until 1948. The
   factors affecting the survival of the trees are mainly of a geological
   nature, especially the rock types and their spatial distribution that
   contribute to the potential of runoff water. Topographic layouts are
   also critical for enhancing water runoff, as well as various soil
   parameters, such as water-holding capacity, depth, salinity, and organic
   matter content. A significant impact on the trees' condition and
   survival depends also on the preservation state of the ancient terraces
   in which they were planted and the level of horticultural expertise of
   the Bedouins in growing fruit trees. During this study we characterized
   the geographical, geological and topographical conditions enabling the
   survival of different fruit trees with no artificially added irrigation
   in various locations within the Southern Israeli desert. Apparently no
   specific genotypes were required and involved in the survival of the
   various fruit trees, but the microconditions at each tree's location
   were found to be critical.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural soil CO2 emissions and their controlling factors have
   recently received increased attention because of the high potential of
   carbon sequestration and their importance in soil fertility. Several
   parameters of soil structure, chemistry, and microbiology were monitored
   along with soil CO2 emissions in research conducted in soils derived
   from a glacial till. The investigation was carried out during the 2012
   growing season in Northern Germany. Higher potentials of soil CO2
   emissions were found in grassland (20.40 mu g g(-1) dry weight h(-1))
   compared to arable land (5.59 mu g g(-1) dry weight h(-1)) within the
   incubating temperature from 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C and incubating
   moisture from 30\% to 70\% water holding capacity (WHC) of soils taken
   during the growing season. For agricultural soils regardless of pasture
   and arable management, we suggested nine key factors that influence
   changes in soil CO2 emissions including soil temperature, metabolic
   quotient, bulk density, WHC, percentage of silt, bacterial biomass, pH,
   soil organic carbon, and hot water soluble carbon (glucose equivalent)
   based on principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis.
   Slightly different key factors were proposed concerning individual land
   use types, however, the most important factors for soil CO2 emissions of
   agricultural soils in Northern Germany were proved to be metabolic
   quotient and soil temperature. Our results are valuable in providing key
   influencing factors for soil CO2 emission changes in grassland and
   arable land with respect to soil respiration, physical status, nutrition
   supply, and microbe-related parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid West Africa faces challenges to increase sorghum and pearl
   millet production to meet food needs for a growing human population
   while increasing soil carbon (C), nutrient levels, and water holding
   capacity that are documented benefits of conservation agriculture. This
   review focuses on the wealth of research on cropping systems, tillage,
   crop residue, nutrient, and weed management as related to conservation
   agriculture. It also identifies needs for multidisciplinary, integrative
   research to assist the transition from current production systems to
   conservation agriculture. Crop residue use as livestock feed, or fuel
   are major constraints to adoption of conservation agriculture, which
   could be reduced by wood production in agroforestry systems, alternate
   energy sources, and increased forage supply. Crop residue and grain
   yields are related, thus improved crop, soil, water, nutrient, and weed
   management to increase grain yield would also increase the supply of
   crop residue with potential for `left over' crop residue being available
   for soil mulching. Incorporating indigenous shrubs and/or cover crops
   could also increase crop residue supply. Species diversity can be
   increased through crop rotation, agroforestry, cover crops, and
   intercrops. Higher grain and stover yields and increased profit
   potential for resource-poor farmers in West Africa will be required
   before wide-scale adoption of conservation agriculture will be possible.}},

Abstract = {{Current intensification of agricultural activities in Indonesia has led

   Ideally, peat swamp ecosystems should not be disturbed as they provide
   essential services such as soil erosion control, ecosystem stabilization
   and moderation of climate and energy fluxes as well as reducing carbon
   emission and conserving biodiversity. In this study, agricultural land
   from Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve in Indonesia was
   evaluated to assess the impact of oil palm (burning and without burning)
   and rubber (5-10 and >40 years old) plantations on soil properties
   through comparisons with soils from a natural forest (NF). Substantial
   changes in the physico-chemical properties of soils from both
   plantations were observed including significant reductions in soil
   organic matter (4-18\%) and water holding capacity (22-53\%), but an
   increase in bulk density (rho b) (0.08-0.17 g cm(-3)). A significant
   increase in bacterial biomass was also observed following conversion of
   the NF to plantation (p<0.05). However, the oil palm plantation (OPP)
   (without burning) showed reduced microbial activities and the lowest
   Shannon diversity values (2.90) compared to other samples.
   Community-level physiological profiling showed impaired community
   function only in soils from the OPP but higher CO2 exchange rates in
   most plantation soils. Soils from the rubber plantation (RP) were less
   impaired in terms of their natural function and therefore RPs appeared
   to be more suitable for sustainable agricultural use than OPP.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of organic matter from agricultural lands constrains our
   ability to sustainably feed a growing population and mitigate the

   C at 8.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), increasing cation exchange and water holding
   capacity by 95\% and 34\%, respectively. Thus, within a decade of
   management-intensive grazing practices soil C levels returned to those
   of native forest soils, and likely decreased fertilizer and irrigation
   demands. Emerging land uses, such as management-intensive grazing, may
   offer a rare win-win strategy combining profitable food production with

Abstract = {{The lower Himalayan regions of north-west India experienced a severe
   land-use change in the recent past. A study was thus conducted to assess
   the effect of grassland, forest, agricultural and eroded land uses on
   soil aggregation, bulk density, pore size distribution and water
   retention and transmission characteristics. The soil samples were
   analysed for aggregate stability by shaking under water and water drop
   stability by using single simulated raindrop technique. The water-stable
   aggregates (WSA) >2mm were highest (173per cent) in the surface layers
   of grassland, whereas the micro-aggregates (WSA<025mm) were highest in
   eroded soils. The water drop stability followed the similar trend. It
   decreased with the increase in aggregate size. Being lowest in eroded
   soils, the soil organic carbon also showed an adverse effect of past
   land-use change. The bulk density was highest in eroded lands, being
   significantly higher for the individual aggregates than that of the bulk
   soils. The macroporosity (>150 mu m) of eroded soils was significantly
   (p<005) lower than that of grassland and forest soils. The grassland
   soils retained the highest amount of water. Significant (p<005) effects
   of land use, soil depth and their interaction were observed in water
   retention at different soil water suctions. Eroded soils had
   significantly (p<005) lower water retention than grassland and forest
   soils. The saturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum water-holding
   capacity of eroded soils were sufficiently lower than those of forest
   and grassland soils. These indicated a degradation of soil physical
   attributes due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to farming system

Abstract = {{Efforts to maintain or increase food production in developed agriculture
   would be compromised if current high-intensity production was degrading

   The link between cropping intensity, defined by pesticide and fertiliser
   applications, and soil biophysical status was examined at 70 sites in a
   high-yielding region of the UK, in which cropping sequences covering a
   wide range of intensity had diverged from a common low-intensity origin
   in the 1970s. Two sequences of still low or moderate intensity based on
   spring cereals or a low frequency of winter cereals formed comparators
   for three high intensity sequences based on winter wheat and potato
   which together were associated with adverse effects of -30\% on soil
   carbon content in the upper soil layer (P < 0.001), -11\% on soil water
   holding capacity (P < 0.01) and +15\% on soil bulk density (P <0.001).
   Negative effects were also found in some high intensity sequences on
   soil macroporosity and penetrometer resistance. Even in this
   high-yielding region, therefore, current forms of intensification are
   associated with adverse trends in soil condition that may be detrimental
   to future production. The effects of these trends in soil condition on
   agricultural output now need to be quantified, and the economic burden

   seed with drum seeder in puddled condition (P-2), manual transplanting
   in puddled soil (P-3) and mechanical transplanting in puddled soil (P-4)

Abstract = {{The application in agriculture has been the main alternative to allocate
   the large volume of pig slurry (PS) generated in production
   environments. The aim of this study was to assess possible changes in
   physical properties of soil resulting from the management system and PS
   application. Five areas were sampled: native forest, pasture with
   mineral fertilizer and PS application, conventional tillage with mineral
   fertilizer and PS application, no-tillage with mineral fertilizer,
   no-tillage with mineral fertilizer and PS application. The evaluated
   physical properties of soil were: bulk density (Bd), total porosity
   (Pt), macroporosity (Ma), macro and microporosity ratio (Ma/Mi) and
   penetration resistance (PR). The adoption of different agricultural
   management systems altered the physical conditions of the soil,
   increasing the Bd and the PR and reducing the pore volume. The soil
   managed under pasture showed the highest values of PR. No changes were
   found in physical properties of soil by the application of PS in
   evaluated tillage systems.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A soil quality database (SQDB) is a collection of soil samples described
   by a given set of parameters, allowing farmers, scientists and other
   stakeholders to make informed decisions about practices, processes and
   policies for soil use and management. If each parameter is considered as
   a dimension of the space spanned by the SQDB, extracting information
   becomes a difficult task when the number of parameters is >3. A widely
   used approach to explore multidimensional data sets is the
   self-organizing map (SOM) method, which is suitable for clustering,
   visualization and extraction of information from multidimensional data.
   We applied the SOM method as an exploratory technique to an unlabelled
   SQDB to extract knowledge - data patterns and data associations - from
   the data set (the time and location of each sample were unknown). The
   SQDB used in this study is a set of 1240 unlabelled samples within the
   Central Valley of Chile, covering ca 7500km(2). The predominant soils
   are Andisols with a large organic matter content (7-12\%), small bulk
   densities (0.6-1.0g/cm(3)) and large water-holding capacity. We
   identified three patterns: (i) isolated region within the map with close
   neurons (smooth transitions), (ii) two or more regions with
   predominantly large or small values and (iii) homogeneous map with small
   values with an isolated region of large values. These patterns show that
   the data set represented more than two groups that were not necessarily
   related. For pH, no important associations with other investigated
   parameters were observed. Previous studies carried out by the local
   agricultural research station showed that pH values below 5.5 constrain
   nutrient uptake. Thus, locations presenting pH<5,5 should be subject to
   seasonal monitoring to assess management practices that mitigate soil
   acidity. The component plane for organic matter indicates that ca. 50\%
   of the soil samples had contents <8\% related to soil series
   characteristics and management practices. As the k-means is initialized
   by random partitions, the two-step approach (clustering the map
   representing the input data) is less sensitive to variations in the
   input data (subsamples) than is the direct application of k-means to the
   input data, but it also reduces the computational cost. The ability of
   SOMs to visualize multidimensional data sets helps gain an understanding
   of the data in the exploratory phase, such as the association and
   integration of physical, chemical and biological parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Population growth and increasing resource demands in Ethiopia are
   stressing and degrading agricultural landscapes. Most Ethiopian soils
   are already exhausted by several decades of over exploitation and
   mismanagement. Since many agricultural sustainability issues are related
   to soil quality, its assessment is very important. We determined
   integrated soil quality indices (SQI) within the surface 0-15 cm depth
   increment for three agricultural land uses: rain fed cultivation (RF);
   agroforestry (AF) and irrigated crop production (IR). Each land use was
   replicated five times within a semi-arid watershed in eastern Tigray,
   Northern Ethiopia. Using the framework suggested by Karlen and Stott
   (1994); four soil functions regarding soil's ability to: (1) accommodate
   water entry (WE); (2) facilitate water movement and availability (WMA);
   (3) resist degradation (RD); and (4) supply nutrients for plant growth
   (PNS) were estimated for each land use. The result revealed that AF
   affected all soil quality functions positively more than the other land
   uses. Furthermore, the four soil quality functions were integrated into
   an overall SQI; and the values for the three land uses were in the
   order: 0.58 (AF) > 0.51 (IR) > 0.47 (RF). The dominant soil properties
   influencing the integrated SQI values were soil organic carbon (26.4\%);
   water stable aggregation (20.0\%); total porosity (16.0\%); total
   nitrogen (11.2\%); microbial biomass carbon (6.4\%); and cation exchange
   capacity (6.4\%). Collectively, those six indicators accounted for more
   than 80\% of the overall SQI values.}},

Title = {{Inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties under oil palm trees}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{306-312}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Canopies of forested and agricultural ecosystems can significantly alter
   rainfall patterns into separate stemflow and throughfall areas. These
   two areas often have also different organic matter contents and soil
   compaction properties, and hence also soil hydraulic properties, thus
   causing further differences in the local infiltration rates close to and
   away from trees. In this study we analyzed possible differences in the
   unsaturated soil hydraulic properties of the stemflow and throughfall
   areas below an oil palm tree. Tension disc infiltrometer experiments
   were carried out underneath the canopy and in the interspace area of an
   oil palm tree plantation at successive tensions of 5, 2, and 0 cm. Soil
   hydraulic properties were estimated inversely from the measured data
   using the HYDROS-2D/3D software package. Four van Genuchten soil
   hydraulic parameters (i.e., the residual water content, theta(r), the
   shape factors alpha and n, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity,
   K-S) were optimized. Saturated water contents, theta(s), were fixed at
   their laboratory-measured values. Initial estimates of the optimized
   parameters were set according to Wooding's solution, which ensured rapid
   convergence of the inverse solution. The stemflow and throughfall
   regions exhibited contrasting hydraulic properties as indicated by the
   estimated hydraulic parameters. Values of theta(s), alpha, n and K-s for
   the stemflow area were all found to be higher as compared to those of
   the throughfall area. The inverse solution using tension disc
   infiltrometer data proved to be very useful for rapid characterization
   of hydraulic properties of soil under the oil palm trees. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The conventional model of aggregate formation suggests a hierarchy where
   micro-aggregates with lower porosity and therefore reduced soil organic
   carbon (SOC) mineralization form inside macro-aggregates. This model has
   however been questioned for highly weathered Oxisols where inconclusive
   results regarding the presence of aggregate hierarchy have been obtained
   to date. We hypothesized that in Oxisols (i) an aggregate hierarchy
   would be present (ii) the porosity of micro-aggregates would be lower
   than that of macro-aggregates and (iii) pore geometry of aggregates
   would influence SOC mineralization. We collected topsoils from Oxisols
   in northern New South Wales, Australia from which macro-aggregates (>250
   mu m), micro-aggregates (53-250 mu m) and <53 mu m fractions were
   isolated from bulk soil by wet sieving. 3D images of macro- and
   micro-aggregates were produced using X-ray computed tomography (mu CT)
   showing the presence of micro-aggregates inside macro-aggregates, which
   confirmed the presence of an aggregate hierarchy in the Oxisols studied.
   Macro-aggregates were more common and SOC in higher concentrations in
   forest systems compared with agricultural (the cultivation or pasture)
   land-uses, but aggregate geometry differed little between the land-uses
   studied. The porosity of macroaggregates (4\%) was significantly lower
   than micro-aggregates (5.5\%). Despite the differences in pore geometry
   between macro- and micro-aggregates, SOC mineralized (SOCmin) during a
   2-month incubation (at 25 degrees C) was similar in macro- (3\% of SOC
   concentration) and micro-aggregates (2.8\% of SOC concentration). We
   conclude that although aggregate hierarchy exists in these soils and
   that aggregate geometry did differ between aggregate size classes, there
   was no evidence to support the porosity exclusion principle and the
   assumption that SOC is preferentially stabilized within microaggregates
   in these soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of alternative materials to peat in soilless crop production,
   such as woody pruning wastes, has been reported by several researchers.
   In Mediterranean countries, several potential alternatives have been
   identified such as palm species or woody pruning wastes coming from
   different plant species. Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a tree crop widely
   used in Europe for urban landscaping and to provide shade. Mulberry
   trees are pruned in sericulture two or three times a year to obtain a
   better yield of leaves. In an urban landscape, the trees are pruned once
   a year to form the canopy. Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.) is a cereal crop
   widely cultivated because it is considered the fourth most important
   summer crop in the world after soy, corn, and sunflower. It is one among
   the few resilient crops that can adapt well to future climate change
   conditions, particularly increasing drought, soil salinity, and high
   temperatures. After the harvest, the inedible parts of the plant, the
   stalks and leaves, are left over and must be disposed of, most of the
   time by burning. Palm trees in Spain, as in most of the European regions
   where palms are cultivated, are mainly used as ornamental plants in
   urban areas. One of the most commonly used palm tree in landscaping is
   the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis Hort. Ex Chavaud).
   These palm trees are pruned up to twice a year in this region, producing
   huge amounts of biomass that are disposed of in landfills. In this
   experiment, physical and chemical parameters were determined in the
   different particle sizes (<0.25, 0.25-1, 1-2, and 2-4mm) of the raw
   residual materials from pruning activities of mulberry (Morus alba L.),
   sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.), and palm (Phoenix canariensis) to evaluate
   their suitability for use as growing substrate. According to the results
   obtained, it can be concluded that the alternative materials for
   substrate preparation obtained from the pruning wastes of Morus alba
   (MAPW), Sorghum vulgare (SVPW), and Phoenix canariensis (PCPW) had
   suitable values of physical properties related to substrate porosity and
   wetting capacity. These materials also had high or very high total
   organic carbon (C) to total nitrogen (N) ratio values and low nutrient
   contents, except for potassium (K) in SVPW and PCPW.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted in 2009-10 and 2010-11 at Indian
   Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to assess the effect of
   sequential tillage and crop establishment and residue management
   practices on soil health and root parameters in soybean {[}Glycine max
   (L.) Merr.] -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system. The results
   pertaining to the experiments at the end of the two year study revealed
   that most of the soil properties except infiltration rate and microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC); and root parameters of both crops except root
   length density (RLD) and average root diameter of wheat were
   non-significant by the sequential tillage and crop establishment
   treatments. Unlike sequential tillage and crop establishment techniques,
   all soil properties except bulk density, pH, EC and root parameters of
   both soybean and wheat responded significantly to the residue management
   practices. The infiltration rate was significantly higher with skipping
   the sequence of CT-Flat by ZT-Flat. Skipping the sequence of CT-Flat and
   bed with ZT-Flat and bed recorded higher soil mean weight diameter (MWD)
   and grand mean diameter (GMD) at 010 cm soil depth than the counterpart
   by skipping of ZT-Flat and bed with CT-Flat and bed. The percentage of
   soil macro-aggregate was high by skipping ZT-Flat and bed with CT-flat
   and bed at all depths while the reverse was exhibited in case of
   percentage soil micro-aggregates by skipping CT-Flat and bed with
   ZT-Flat and bed. By skipping CT-flat and bed with ZT-flat and bed
   significantly higher soil MBC was recorded than the counterpart skipping
   tillage treatments. The same significant trend was also exhibited for
   soil MBC with residue management treatments, where the wheat + soybean
   residue application recorded 20.90 \% higher than the control. Root
   parameters like RLD, root surface area (RSA), root volume density (RVD),
   average root diameter (ARD) in soybean while these were partly
   non-significant (RSD and RVD) in wheat with the sequential tillage and
   crop establishment treatments, whereas the residue management practices
   significantly influenced the root parameters of both the crops. Among
   the residue management practices, wheat + soybean residue obtained
   higher RLD (2.57 and 1.03 cm/cm(3)); RSA (0.79 and 0.32 cm(2)/cm(3));
   RVD (18.11 and 7.46 x 10(-3) cm(3)/cm(3)) and average root diameter
   (1.04 and 0.85 mm) both in soybean and wheat crops than rest of the

   favourable soil health and root parameters when skipping with

Abstract = {{Biochar derived from agricultural biomass waste is increasingly
   recognized as multifunctional material for various applications
   according its characteristics. It is therefore essential to investigate
   biochar properties before large-scale application. In this study, rice
   straw-derived biochars produced at different temperature (550, 650, 750
   degrees C). The resulting biochars were subjected to liquid-phase
   oxidation by different agents including KOH, HNO3, H2SO4, H2O2 and KMnO4
   to obtain biochar with different properties. Pore structure
   characteristics including surface area, micro and meso pore volume, and
   pore size distribution were studied. Biochar surface is sensitive to the
   type of modifying reagent. Biochars treated by KOH, KMnO4 and H2O2 give
   higher nitrogen uptake in the range of micropores and mesopores. The
   rice straw-derived biochars especially produced at 650 degrees C and
   treated by KOH have the highest surface area (179.7 m(2)/g) and
   micropore volume (0.081 cc/g) than the rest of biochars. In contrast,
   biochars treated by H2SO4 and HNO3 give lower nitrogen uptake and lead
   to loss of the biochars porosity. Loss of micropore volume is as low as
   10-40\% of pore volume in H2SO4 and HNO3 treated biochars. Biochars
   exhibit wide pore size distribution, from narrow micropores to wide
   mesopores. One modal distribution was obtained with peak oscillate in
   region of 1.0 to 1.3 nm in the case of micropore region. However, for
   mesopore region, two minima at about 3.0 nm and 5.0 nm were observed.
   More homogonous micropore distribution was produced from KOH and H2O2

Abstract = {{The highly weathered, mineral, and often eroded and acidic soils of the
   Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas generally have low soil
   organic matter (SOM) concentrations as a result of rapid organic matter
   turnover rates in the warm, moist climate. Orchard management practices
   that can improve SOM may also improve other soil quality-related
   variables for sustained production, which is an explicit goal for the
   National Organic Program (NOP). Therefore, beginning in Mar. 2006 and
   continuing for seven seasons, annual applications of municipal green
   compost, shredded office paper, wood chips, and mow-blow grass mulch
   groundcover management systems (GMS) in combination with composted
   poultry litter, commercial organic fertilizer, or a non-fertilized
   control as a nutrient source were implemented to evaluate their ability
   to alter near-surface soil quality in a newly established, organically
   managed apple orchard in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest
   Arkansas. The SOM concentration in the top 10 cm averaged 1.5\% across
   all treatments at orchard establishment in 2006, but by 2012, SOM
   concentration had increased in all GMS and more than doubled to 5.6\%
   under green compost. Similarly, soil bulk density in the top 6 cm, which
   averaged 1.34 g.cm(-3) among treatment combinations in 2006, decreased
   in all GMS by 2012. Either green compost or shredded paper had the
   largest concentration of total water-stable aggregates across all
   aggregate size classes in the top 7.5 cm, whereas no differences among
   GMS were observed in the 7.5- to 15-cm soil depth. Green compost applied
   alone or in combination with commercial fertilizer had the largest
   estimated plant-available water (17.9\% v/v) among all treatment
   combinations. Many soil quality-related variables measured in the
   various organic GMS had numerically greater values compared with an
   adjacent conventionally managed orchard on the same soils.
   Implementation of these GMS appears to provide apple producers in the
   Ozark Highlands and similar regions a tangible means of meeting NOP
   requirements for improving soil quality concurrent with production of
   certified organic crops. The findings also have implications for
   conventionally managed orchards, which have maintaining or improving
   soil quality as a management goal.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, interest in urban farms and community gardens is
   flourishing, yet the urban home food garden (UHFG) and its contributions
   to urban systems have been overlooked and understudied. To begin to
   address this gap, we are conducting a mixed methods study of African
   American, Chinese-origin and Mexican-origin households with home gardens
   in Chicago, IL. Study methods include in-depth interviews, participant
   observation, ethnobotanical surveys and analysis of the chemical and
   physical properties of garden soils. As of this writing, findings
   indicate that home gardening has an array of beneficial effects,
   contributing to household food budgets and community food systems, the
   reproduction of cultural identity and urban biodiversity. The majority
   of informants in the study were internal or international migrants. For
   these individuals, gardening, culture-specific food plant assemblages
   and the foodways they support represent a continuation of cultural
   practices and traditional agroecological knowledge associated with their
   place of origin. The gardens of some migrant households also harbor
   urban agrobiodiversity with roots in the Global South. At the same time,
   gardens may have less salubrious effects on urban systems and
   populations. Alack of knowledge of safe gardening practices may expose
   vulnerable populations to environmental hazards such as soil
   contaminants. Gardeners in this study reported using synthetic chemical
   fertilizers and pesticides, sometimes indiscriminately, and the repeated
   application of synthetic fertilizers and compostmay contribute to the
   nutrient loading of urban stormwater runoff. These effects may be
   moderated by the relatively low bulk density and high porosity of garden
   soils due to tillage and the application of organic matter, which can be
   expected to enhance stormwater infiltration. While the UHFG's potential
   contributions to urban systems are significant, outreach and research
   are needed to help gardeners grow food safely and sustainably in ways
   that contribute to overall ecosystem health.}},

   biochars are dictated by the feedstock and production processes
   (pyrolysis or gasification temperature, conversion technology and pre-
   and post-treatment processes, if any), which vary widely across
   commercially produced biochars. In this study, several commercially
   available biochars derived from waste wood are characterized for
   physical and chemical properties that can signify their relevant
   environmental applications. Parameters characterized include: physical
   properties (particle size distribution, specific gravity, density,
   porosity, surface area), hydraulic properties (hydraulic conductivity
   and water holding capacity), and chemical and electrochemical properties
   (organic matter and organic carbon contents, pH, oxidation-reduction
   potential and electrical conductivity, zeta potential, carbon, nitrogen
   and hydrogen (CHN) elemental composition, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and leachable PAHs and heavy metals).
   A wide range of fixed carbon (0-47.8\%), volatile matter (28-74.1\%),
   and ash contents (1.5-65.7\%) were observed among tested biochars. A
   high variability in surface area (0.1-155.1 g/m(2)) and PAH and heavy
   metal contents of the solid phase among commercially available biochars
   was also observed (0.7-83 mg kg(-1)), underscoring the importance of
   pre-screening biochars prior to application. Production conditions
   appear to dictate PAM content - with the highest PAHs observed in
   biochar produced via fast pyrolysis and lowest among the
   gasification-produced biochars. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of agricultural exploitation of
   soils of the north-western Crimea, the active and large-scale
   cultivation of which began with the Greek colonization of the area. In
   order to compare soils using a wide spectrum of physical and chemical
   properties, the studied objects (virgin land, post-antique idle land,
   continually plowed land, modern-day plowed land, idle land of the modern
   era) have been grouped into a chronosequence. This makes it possible to
   apply the method of factor sequences of agrogenic transformations in
   soils, which takes into account different periods of human activities.
   The other factors involved in soil formation are considered to be
   relatively invariable. From the mass of physiochemical properties of
   these soils that have endured long-term agricultural stress, the most
   informative indicators of agrogenesis have been identified. The authors
   propose a procedure for calculating an integral agrophysical soil
   indicator based on five parameters that can be used to determine the
   soil structure and cloddiness as well as water-stability, the amount of
   water-stable aggregates and their mean mass-weighted diameter. Based on
   the estimates of their agrophysical state, the following sequence has
   been determined for the soils studied: Post-antique idle land < virgin
   land < idle land of the modern era < continuously plowed land <
   modem-day plowed land. It has been established that the previous
   practices of land use favorably affect the agrophysical properties of
   soils.
   The loss of organic carbon in continually plowed land is 51\%, while in
   modern-day plowed and idle lands it amounts to 39\% and 27-32\%
   respectively. The reproduction of soil organic matter (SOM) and its
   quality, particularly of its labile content, which is responsible for
   the agrophysical properties of a plow horizon, is central to soil
   fertility management for sustainable agriculture. One observed effect of
   long-term agrogenic stresses in plowed horizons of Chernozems is a
   decrease in microelements such as Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, as well as
   phosphorus and potassium. It is estimated that the micronutrient content
   of plowed land is 5-6\% lower than that of virgin soils. Even after 2280
   years of renaturation, soils of post-antique idle lands preserve in
   their pedomemory the signs of agrogenesis. In terms of soil quality, the
   overall agrogenic transformation of soils cultivated during the recent
   period (the last 150-165 years) is 15\% lower than that of the
   continually plowed lands. The fallowing regime provides conditions that
   allow soils to regenerate within a few decades. The use of renaturation
   effects that mimic the fallowing regime opens up new possibilities for
   resource-saving sustainable agriculture.
   This study, therefore, shows the informative potential of soils that
   have continuously, or with restorative periods, been subjected to
   long-term agrogenic impacts under different practices of land use. It
   also considers how this information may be actively employed to
   comprehend the long-term transformations of the material and energetic
   organization of soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tef crop shares the largest area of production in Ethiopia. However, its
   productivity is lower than 0.7 ton ha(-1) which is mainly related to low
   soil fertility and moisture. An experiment was conducted using tef on
   Chromic Cambisols for two rainy cropping seasons (2008-2009) in northern
   Ethiopia. The objective was to assess the short-term effects of tillage
   frequencies on selected soil properties under continuous tef cropping
   system. The layout of the experiment was randomized complete block
   design using three tillage treatments, namely, conventional plowing
   (T1), four times plowing (T2), and reduced plowing (T3). A statistically
   significant (P <= 0.05) effect of tillage treatments on soil moisture
   (SM) was determined during the experimental periods. SM was higher in T2
   in both years followed by T3 in 2009. Soil physical properties (bulk
   density, BD; total porosity, TP; soil structural stability index, SSI)
   and soil nutrients (total nitrogen, TN; organic carbon, OC; cation
   exchange capacity, CEC; potassium, K) were significantly deteriorated by
   the application of T1 for consecutive two-years. The Paired-Samples
   T-Test showed significant improvements in these soil parameters due to
   T2 and T3 in 2009 as compared to the corresponded values in 2008. For
   example, there were significant increments in SM (11\%), TP (18\%), SSI
   (12\%), TN (1.2 times), phosphorous (5\%), OC (13\%), and CEC (15\%);
   but significantly decreased in OC: TN (48\%) and BD (4\%). Generally,
   despite the non-significant differences between the effects of T2 and
   T3, higher TP, SSI, OC, CEC; and lower BD were observed by T3 in 2009.
   Based on such short-term results of T3 it is possible to forecast its
   significant long-term effects on soil properties. Thus, for sustainable
   use of soil systems in the long-term due attention should be given to
   practice T3 as soil and water management practice in the study area
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter is widely recognized as a strategy used to improve
   soil quality and reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere. A field
   study was carried out to investigate the effects of cover crops in
   organic no-till vegetables systems on changes in soil organic matter and
   CO2-C emissions, in dry and rainy seasons. We hypothesized that CO2-C
   emissions are higher in conventional till as compared with no-till, and
   that no-till increases soil C sink. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year
   cropping sequence involving two crops per year-cabbage (Brassica
   oleracea L.) in winter and eggplant (Solanum melongena L) in summer
   time. Treatments were no-till on dead mulch of grass (Avena strigosa
   Schreb. and Zea mays L.), leguminous (Lupinus albus L and Crotalaria
   juncea L.), intercrop (grass and leguminous) and conventional till (no
   dead mulch) with rotary hoe arranged in a randomized block design on a
   clayey Oxisol (Typic Haplustox) at Domingos Martins-ES, Brazil. On 2012
   and 2013, disturbed soil samples at three different layers (0-5,5-15 and
   15-30 cm) and undisturbed samples at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm, for
   chemical and organic matter characterization were taken. CO2-C emissions
   and soil temperature were measured in situ on March, May, August and
   October 2012 and February 2013 (after 3 years of experiment).
   Conventional till site showed the lowest microporosity values and the
   highest macroporosity, followed by lower soil bulk density at 0-10 cm
   layer. Total organic C ranged from 34.94 to 50.48 g kg(-1) in intercrop
   and 27.11 to 43.74 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Total N ranged from
   2.81 to 5.34 g kg(-1) in grass and 2.54 to 4.51 g kg(-1) in conventional
   till. Highest C stock was recorded in intercrop. Conventional till
   showed lower labile C values while recalcitrant C was higher in the
   intercrop treatment. The annual average of CO2-C emissions (mu mol CO2
   m(-2) s(-1)) followed the order: grass (15.89) > intercrop (13.77) >
   leguminous (13.09) > conventional till (11.20). Highest annual average
   of soil temperature was recorded in conventional till (23.95 degrees C).
   Lowest annual mean of soil water content, microbial biomass C, and
   highest metabolic quotient were recorded in conventional till. These
   results suggest that the use of cover crops and organic compost in
   pre-planting promote C increments. The contribution of organic residues
   increases the water holding capacity and reduces soil temperature.
   No-till reduces soil disturbance and promotes a positive balance of C.
   Organic no-till vegetable systems is a strategy to increase soil C and
   should be encouraged in order to increase soil quality in the Atlantic
   Forest Biome in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance and improvement of soil quality across spatially variable
   soils in continuous cropping systems are critical to sustaining
   agricultural productivity and environmental quality. The objectives of
   this project were (i) to study the effects of variable-rate application
   of animal manure on selected topsoil quality parameters across
   site-specific management zones (MZs) and (ii) to evaluate the
   variable-rate applications of manure using risk-assessment tools of
   nitrogen (N) leaching and phosphorus (P) runoff indices to understand
   its impact on environmental quality. This study was conducted in
   northeastern Colorado on continuous and furrow-irrigated maize fields.
   Experimental strips, 4.5 m wide and 540 m long, spanned across all MZs
   with treatments nested within MZs in the field. Variable rates of dairy
   and beef feedlot manure applied on irrigated and dryland fields
   respectively ranged from 0 to 67 Mg ha(-1). Surface soil quality
   parameters evaluated before and after this study included bulk density,
   organic matter, water-holding capacity, electrical conductivity, and
   particle-size analysis. Results indicate that animal manure applications
   of 44 and 67 Mg ha(-1) significantly (P <= 0.05) increased soil organic
   matter and decreased bulk density of low- and medium-productivity-level
   MZs and had no significant impact on surface soil organic matter and
   bulk density of the high-productivity-level MZs. Animal manure
   significantly (P <= 0.05) increased surface soil water-holding capacity
   and soil electrical conductivity across zones; however, the maximum
   manure-induced soil EC was 1.0 dS m(-1), which was below levels regarded
   as potentially harmful for maize production. Soil texture was not
   affected by animal manure applications. Colorado N leaching and P index
   indicated no environmental hazard associated with variable rate
   application of animal manure across MZs. This study indicates that
   variable-rate application of animal manure across MZs has potential to
   improve or maintain soil quality parameters over time without impairing
   the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of no tillage (NT) has increased worldwide in recent
   decades and particularly in Argentina, although sometimes doubts have
   been raised about its effect on soil physical properties. The objective
   of this work was to evaluate changes due to the use and management
   intensities on some parameters associated with soil porosity and water
   storage in four sites in the Argentinian Pampas. At each site, farmer's
   fields with different agricultural types of management (Good Practices -
   GP-and Poor Practices - PP) and natural (Natural Environment NE) were
   selected. The lowest levels of total organic carbon (TOC) as a result of
   agricultural practices caused a decrease in soil total porosity, mainly
   reflected in a lower volume of macropores (>30 mu m), which decreased by
   12\% on average. Agricultural use resulted in soil compaction, although
   not critical, at the expense of a decrease of macropores, while
   differences between GP and PP were influenced by soil type. Regarding
   the type of soil, Argiudolls (silty soils), were more vulnerable to
   agricultural intensification, which increased degradation processes by
   compaction. The TOC and structural stability index (SSI) were the only
   variables where values lower than optimal in agricultural treatment were
   observed. Due to the clear relationship between physical properties and
   the SSI, the latter can be useful for assessing the impact of different
   uses and management intensities on the soil physical quality, where
   values < 6.13 can cause compaction problems.}},

   (1.25 and 2.5 kg.m(-2)) mulching. The study results indicated that each

   effect on infiltration, and it was more effective on AS, when compared
   to other conditioners. SM and PP applications increased AS depending on
   the increase of organic matter content in the soil. PAM application at
   given concentrations had no significant effects on water-holding

   literature search of published information largely from Australia, but
   also including relevant information from overseas. The soil properties
   considered included aggregate stability, bulk density, water-holding
   capacity, soil erodibility, soil colour, soil strength, compaction
   characteristics, friability, nutrient cycling, cation exchange capacity,
   soil acidity and buffering capacity, capacity to form ligands and
   complexes, salinity, and the interaction of SOM with soil biology.
   Increases in SOM have the capacity to have strong influence only the
   physical properties of the surface soils, perhaps only the top 10 cm, or
   the top 20 cm at most. This limits the capacity of SOM to influence soil
   productivity. Even so, the top 20 cm is a critical zone for the soil. It
   is where seeds are sown, germinate and emerge. It is where a large
   proportion of plant materials are added to the soil for decomposition
   and recycling of nutrients and where rainfall either enters the soil or
   runs off. Therefore, the potential to improve soil condition in the top
   0-20 cm is still critical for plant productivity. The SOM through
   nutrient cycling such as mineralisation of organic nitrogen to nitrate
   can have an influence on the soil profile.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgal biomass is utilized in many fields such as food, agriculture,
   energy, and cosmetic sectors. It is very well known that chemical
   fertilizer adversely affect soil, plant, and environment. To reduce this
   effect in recent years, interest to organic farming has been increasing.
   In this study, microbial fertilizers obtained from microalgae was
   applied to maize and wheat plants. Microbial fertilizers at four
   different doses were applied, namely, S1 (control: 0,00 dose-non
   fertilizer), S2 (0.50 dose), S3 (1.00 dose), and S4 (1.50 dose). All
   measurements were made at the end of 30th days. The best results were
   determined for S3 dose applications. During the experiment, the soil
   temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C and soil pH values between 6.5
   and 8.5 were maintained. The results showed that the amount of soil
   organic matter and the water holding capacity were improved. Finally,
   microbial fertilizers obtained from microalgae can be reported to have
   positive effects on soil, plants and therefore environment.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of various agrotechnical measures on macrostructural
   changes in topsoil and subsoil was studied in the course of a four-year
   experiment. Macrostructure was evaluated according to the ability of
   soil aggregate to resist degradation. Three variants of soil tillage
   were established: ploughing to a depth of 0.22 m, reduced tillage
   (subsoiling to 0.35-0.40 m, and shallow disking of soil to a depth of
   0.15 m). For observation, three locations were chosen in various
   production areas of the Czech Republic with differing soil and climatic
   conditions. In these locations crops were grown under the same crop
   rotation: rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),
   maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and barley (Hordeum
   vulgare). After four years of different tillage, a change in the water
   stability of soil aggregates (WSA) was evident. It was found out that
   reduced tillage of soil positively influenced both the WSA and the yield
   of the crops grown. A relationship of positive dependence between WSA,
   the content of humus substances, and cation exchange capacity of soil
   was also found. According to the obtained results, for agricultural

   REVIEW}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The drive toward adoption of conservation agriculture to reduce costs
   and increase production sustainably causes concern due to the
   potentially negative effects of increased soil compaction. Soil
   compaction reduces aeration, water infiltration, and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity and increases the risk of waterlogging. Controlled traffic
   farming (CTF) is a system in which: (1) all machinery has the same or
   modular working and track width so that field traffic can be confined to
   the least possible area of permanent traffic lanes, (2) all machinery is
   capable of precise guidance along those permanent traffic lanes, and (3)
   the layout of the permanent traffic lanes is designed to optimize
   surface drainage and logistics. Without CTF, varying equipment operating
   and track widths translate into random traffic patterns, which can cover
   up to 85\% of the cultivated field area each time a crop is produced.
   Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the greatest contributor to agriculture's
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cropping, and research suggests that
   its production increases significantly under conditions of high (>60\%)
   water-filled porosity when nitrate (mainly from fertilizer N) and carbon
   (usually from crop residues) are available. Self-amelioration of soils
   affected by compaction occurs slowly from the surface downward; however,
   the rate of amelioration decreases with increase in depth. Consequently,
   all soils in non-CTF systems in mechanized agriculture are prone to some
   degree of compaction, which compromises water infiltration, increases
   the frequency and duration of waterlogged conditions, reduces gaseous
   exchange between soil and the atmosphere, inhibits root penetration and
   exploitation of nutrients and water in the subsoil, and enhances N2O
   emissions. Adoption of CTF increases soil porosity in the range of 5\%
   to 70\%, water infiltration by a factor of 4, and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity by a factor of 2. The greater cropping opportunity and
   enhanced crop growth for given fertilizer and rainfall inputs offered by
   CTF, coupled with no-tillage, provide potential for enhanced soil carbon
   sequestration. Reduced need and intensity of tillage, where compaction
   is avoided, also helps protect soil organic matter in stable aggregates,
   which may otherwise be exposed and oxidized. There is both
   circumstantial and direct evidence to suggest that improved soil
   structural conditions and aeration offered by CTF can reduce N2O
   emissions by 20\% to 50\% compared with non-CTF. It is not compaction
   per se that increases the risk of N2O emissions but rather the increased
   risk of waterlogging and increase in water-filled pore space. There may
   be an elevated risk of GHG emissions from the relatively small area of
   permanent traffic lanes (typically <20\% of total cultivated area) if
   these are not managed appropriately. Quantification of the benefits of
   compaction avoidance in terms of GHG emissions may be possible through
   the use of well-developed models.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties helps to understand the
   complexity and dynamic patterns of solute distributions in soils. This
   study assessed the effects of slurry additions and soil physical
   properties on preferential flow and nitrate concentrations in two
   Mediterranean soils of central Chile under conventional agriculture
   management with long-term slurry additions. Two alluvial basins
   continuously cropped with maize (Zea mays) were selected, Pichidegua
   (Mollic Xerofluvent) and San Pedro (Fluventic Humixerept). Soils that
   had been amended with pig slurry were compared with unamended controls.
   Soil texture, bulk density, particle density, organic matter, porosity
   and hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were measured. Soil nitrate
   concentrations at different depths were determined every 2 weeks during
   the study, and a dye tracer test using Brilliant Blue FCF was conducted
   on each soil. Digital picture analysis was then performed to classify
   flow types in the soil profiles through the distribution of stained path
   width. Stained path width allowed classification of soil flow types.
   Preferential flow showed no evidence of being affected by pig slurry;
   the stained patterns were mainly explained by tillage and soil physical
   properties, such as texture and Ks. Matrix flow-types in the first
   horizon grading to macropore flow-types at depth characterised all
   profiles, except San Pedro amended soil, where homogeneous matrix flow
   dominated through the entire profile. Concentrations of nitrate showed
   temporal variation during the measurement season, mainly due to the
   mineralisation-immobilisation budget and leaching, both triggered by
   Mediterranean climate conditions. Physical properties helped to explain
   nitrate distribution in the studied soils.}},

Abstract = {{Macrofauna-induced bioturbation of soil is dominated by earthworms,
   among other invertebrates, in most grassland and forest soil. First
   observed by Darwin, bioturbation drives particle mixing in the upper
   surface layers, leading to beneficial results to agricultural soils,
   including enhanced porosity, water permeability, and aeration and
   improved organic matter and nutrient distributions. Applied pesticides
   and other chemicals residing on surface soils are transported downward
   into the soil column by a random mixing of particles. This physical
   particle diffusion, which conceptually mimics the random mixing of
   molecular species in fluids, is treated as a Fickian chemical flux
   mechanism. Using this mechanism, for the mobility rate, while extending
   the soil-water advection-dispersion model to particles, yields a
   theoretical approach for obtaining the biodiffusion coefficient (D-b).
   The D-b is a numerical soil parameter reflecting biology-induced
   particle movement and differs significantly from the conventional
   physical and chemical diffusion coefficients. It is a kinetic parameter
   with units of square centimeters per year and when used with the bulk
   density gradient quantifies the soil particle mobility rate within the
   bioturbated surface layer. Field measurements on soil turnover rates and
   mixing depth from the literature, including Darwin's work, were used to
   produce D-b data sets for earthworms, ants, termites, and so on. The
   highly variable coefficients necessitate lognormal statistics to
   summarize the findings. However, the average D-b values for the three
   invertebrates were 2.12, 0.39, and 0.75 cm(2) year(-1), respectively,
   and surprisingly similar. The need for more field and laboratory data,
   process-based and speciesspecific theoretical models, and chemical-based
   soil D-b are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To make recycling utilization of organic materials produced in various
   agricultural systems, five kinds of organic materials were applied in a
   field test, including crop straw (CS), biogas residue (BR), mushroom
   residue (MR), wine residue (WR), pig manure (PM), with a mineral
   fertilizer (CF) and a no-fertilizer (CK) treatment as a control. Our
   objectives were: i) to quantify the effects of organic materials on soil
   C and N accumulation; ii) to evaluate the effects of organic materials
   on soil aggregate stability, along with the total organic carbon (TOC),
   and N in different aggregate fractions; and iii) to assess the
   relationships among the organic material components, soil C and N, and
   C, N in aggregate fractions. The trial was conducted in Wuqiao County,
   Hebei Province, China. The organic materials were incorporated at an
   equal rate of C, and combined with a mineral fertilizer in amounts of
   150 kg N ha(-1), 26 kg P ha(-1) and 124 kg K ha(-1) respectively during
   each crop season of a wheat-maize rotation system. The inputted C
   quantity of each organic material treatment was equivalent to the total
   amount of C contained in the crop straw harvested in CS treatement in
   the previous season. TOC, N, water-stable aggregates, and
   aggregate-associated TOC and N were investigated. The results showed
   that organic material incorporation increased soil aggregation and
   stabilization. On average, the soil macroaggregate proportion increased
   by 14\%, the microaggregate proportion increased by 3\%, and mean-weight
   diameter (MWD) increased by 20\%. TOC content followed the order of
   PM>WR>MR>BR>CS>CK>CF; N content followed the order WR>PM>MR>BR>CS>CF>CK.
   No significant correlation was found between TOC, N, and the quality of
   organic material. Soil silt and clay particles contained the largest
   part of TOC, whereas the small macroaggregate fraction was the most
   sensitive to organic materials. Our results indicate that PM and WR
   exerted better effects on soil C and N accumulation, followed by MR and
   BR, suggesting that organic materials from ex situ farmland could
   promote soil quality more as compared to straw returned in situ.}},

Abstract = {{South American countries with the highest surface of land under

   aggregation and infiltration achieved by NT management in dry-land
   farming areas associated with increases of bulk density (delta(b)) under

   macro and mesoporosity that is in contradiction with the increased
   infiltration that occurs at macro and mesopores. We hypothesize that the
   increase of bulk density in NT management mainly affects the mesopores.
   We evaluated the evolution of the soil physical parameters in three
   management systems in four farmers' fields. We found that the reduction
   in total porosity under NT management is mainly a product of a reduction
   in the percentage of mesopores in the soil. In this work, the results
   indicate a modification of some soil physical parameters (porosity,

Abstract = {{Carbonaceous material from pyrolysis (pyrochars) and hydrothermal
   carbonization (hydrochars) are applied to soil to improve soil fertility
   and carbon sequestration. As a positive side effect, the mobility of
   pesticides and the risk of groundwater contamination can be minimized.
   However, the impact of various raw materials on the sorption capacity of
   different pyrochars and hydrochars is poorly understood. Thus, sorption
   experiments were performed with C-14-labeled isoproturon (IPU, 0.75 kg
   ha(-1)) in a loamy sand soil amended with either pyrochar or hydrochar
   (0.5\% and 5\% dry weight, respectively). Carbonaceous materials were
   produced from three different raw materials: corn digestate, miscanthus,
   woodchips of willow and poplar. After 72 h of incubation, a sequential
   extraction procedure was conducted to quantify in situ IPU
   bioavailability, total amount of extractable IPU, and non-extractable
   pesticide residues (NER).
   Added char amount, carbonization type, and raw materials had
   statistically significant effects on the sorption of IPU. The amount of
   in situ available IPU was reduced by a factor of 10-2283 in treatments
   with pyrochar and by a factor of 3-13 in hydrochar treatments. The
   surface area of the charred material was the most predictive variable of
   IPU sorption to char amended soil. Some physical and chemical char
   properties tend to correlate with pore water-, methanol- or
   non-extractable IPU amounts. Due to a low micro-porosity and ash
   content, high water extractable carbon contents and O-functional groups
   of hydrochars, the proportion of NER in hydrochar amended soils was
   considerably lower than in soil amended with pyrochars. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Biochar is often proposed to increase soil quality and crop yield, while
   sequestering carbon. Despite the growing number of studies in temperate
   regions, the claimed positive effects are still unsure for northwestern
   European soils. Moreover, there is a need to upscale results from lab
   and pot studies in these soil types to field experiments.
   The objectives of this study were therefore to investigate the effect of
   biochar application to a temperate agricultural soil on soil chemical,
   physical and biological properties, and on crop growth and nutrient
   uptake under field circumstances. A field trial, located in Merelbeke
   (Belgium), was established in October 2011 and monitored until August
   2013. The biochar applied was produced from a mixture of hard- and
   softwood at 480 degrees C. The biochar dose was 0 (control) or 20 t
   ha(-1) (on dry weight basis). Over two years, biochar addition to soil
   did not affect soil chemical properties, except for organic carbon
   content and C:N ratios. Effects on bulk density, porosity and soil water
   retention curves were non-consistent over time, possibly due to
   interaction with tillage operations. Biochar increased soil water
   content in 2012, although mostly not significantly. However, in 2013,
   when soil water content was overall lower compared to 2012, it was not
   affected by biochar addition. Soil temperature, as measured at a soil
   depth interval of 8-20 cm, was not changed by biochar addition.
   Furthermore, biochar addition to soil did only slightly influence soil
   microbiological community structure during the first year after biochar
   application, as only certain bacterial biomarker PLFAs were
   significantly affected by biochar addition, but no fungal biomarker
   PLFAs. Hence, it was not surprising that biochar addition did not affect
   crop yield, N or P uptake during the first two years after biochar
   application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This chronosequential study focusses on the vegetation succession,
   pedogenesis, carbon stocks and different carbon pools of post-agrogenic
   Calcisol-Solonetz complexes in the dry steppe zone of Russia. The sites
   were comparable in terms of climate, soil texture and land-use history,
   but differed in the duration of agricultural abandonment, covering 1, 7,
   12, 17 and 42 years of self-restoration. During self-restoration without
   direct human impact, the vegetation developed towards a steppe with
   dominance of Artemisia lercheana/pauciflora and Stipa pennata. After 17
   years, the abundance of Artemisia pauciflora indicated again the
   Solonetz locations within the Calcisol-Solonetz complex, which were not
   visible during arable land use. Pedogenesis resulted in the recovery of
   the natural soil structure-fine subangular polyhedral for Calcisol and
   crumble fine platy for Solonetz. The recovery of soil structure of
   Solonetz was in accordance with a decline of water-stable aggregates
   from 84\% to 68\%. The plow features were still well visible after 42
   years of self-restoration in both soil groups. Partial integration of
   Btn materials into the plow layer induced a pH increase during
   cultivation of the Solonetzes, while slight pH decreases were observed
   during self-restoration afterwards. Other chemical properties of both
   soil groups remained unchanged. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed an
   exchange sodium percentage (ESP) below 5.0\% and an electrical
   conductivity (ECe) below 50 mS m(-1) at the topsoil during the period of
   self-restoration. The development towards natural soils was observed in
   terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. SOC stocks of the Calcisols
   increased slowly from 2.0 to 3.5 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-0.5 m,
   comprising 64\% of the natural soil. SOC stocks of the Solonetzes grew
   from 1.7 to 3.1 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-05 m and almost reached the
   level of natural soil already after 12 years of self-restoration. The
   long-term modelling showed a recovery of SOC stocks almost after 100
   years for the Calcisol and the Solonetz chronosequences. The nutrient
   dynamics traced SOC dynamics during the self-restoration. The
   investigation of different carbon pools showed a significant organic
   carbon (OC) enrichment of the density fractions <1.8 g cm(-3) (free
   particulate organic material (POM) and occluded POM) and the density
   fractions >1.8 g cm(-3) (sand coarse/medium silt, fine silt, clay)
   following an increase of total SOC during self-restoration. In the
   Calcisol chronosequence, the dynamics of all fractions was close to the
   dynamics of total SOC with the exception of free POM showing a moderate
   accumulation rate in relation to total SOC. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes
   showed a more intensive accumulation of free POM and a slower OC
   sequestration in aggregates compared to total SOC. Both chronosequences
   showed comparable recovery rates for the passive SOC pool and total SOC.
   Despite all these alterations the study showed no full restoration for
   many parameters within the chronosequential time scale of 42 years. (C)

Abstract = {{The research was carried out to determine the effect of basin-based
   conservation agriculture (CA) on selected soil quality parameters.
   Paired plots (0.01ha) of CA and conventional tillage based on the
   animal-drawn mouldboard plough (CONV) were established between 2004 and
   2007 on farm fields on soils with either low (12-18\% - sandy loams and
   sandy clay loams) or high clay levels (>18-46\% - sandy clays and clays)
   as part of an ongoing project promoting CA in six districts in the
   smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe. We hypothesized that CA would
   improve soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density, aggregate stability,
   soil moisture retention and infiltration rate. Soil samples for SOC and
   aggregate stability were taken from 0 to 15cm depth and for bulk density
   and soil moisture retention from 0 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 15cm depths
   in 2011 from maize plots. Larger SOC contents, SOC stocks and improved
   aggregate stability, decreased bulk density, increased pore volume and
   moisture retention were observed in CA treatments. Results were
   consistent with the hypothesis, and we conclude that CA improves soil
   quality under smallholder farming. Benefits were, however, greater in
   high clay soils, which is relevant to the targeting of practices on
   smallholder farming areas of sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study was carried out of annual ridge tillage (RT) and

   did not significantly influence bulk density and aggregate stability
   (geometric mean diameter) although structural stability was greater

Abstract = {{Sustainable agricultural production requires prudent management backed
   by reliable information that accurately elucidates the complex
   relationships between land management practices and soil quality trends.
   Therefore, this study investigates the influence of management on soil
   properties acquired at different depths, and yields, at five different
   field sites within Ohio, USA. The principal management systems
   considered were no till with or without manure and cover crops, natural
   vegetation (NV) or forest, and conventional tillage (CT) defined as
   farms with surface residue cover (< 30 \%). Analyses of variance
   (ANOVA), correlation analyses, stepwise regression, and the principal
   component analyses (PCA) were used to elucidate and model the link
   between four different management practices and the soil physical and
   chemical properties. The ANOVA results indicate that the available water
   capacity and electrical conductivity (EC) were the major variables
   affected by management. In contrast, soil pH, bulk density (rho (b)),
   porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were
   invariable with management, yet only pH and EC did not significantly
   vary with the interaction of soil type and management effects. In
   comparison, the PCA results suggest that SOC, TN, porosity, rho (b), and
   EC were the major determining factors controlling yield variability.
   Interestingly, the derived models revealed that the highest yields,
   notably 10 and 2.7 Mg ha(-1) for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.) occurred in soils under CT management. Quantifying the
   nexus between soil properties and management choices as demonstrated in
   this study, can provide critical insight for sustainable agricultural

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) makes up a significant portion of the worlds
   terrestrial carbon stocks, and changes in land-use and land cover are
   changing soil carbon stocks. This study investigated the effects on soil
   organic carbon and some other soil properties of afforestation efforts
   using 15-year-old Pinus nigra Am. Subsp. nigra (Black Pine) and Cedrus
   libani A. Rich (Lebanon cedar) on bare land in the semi-arid Nigde
   Akkaya dam watershed for erosion control and green belt creation. Soil
   samples were collected from three land use types (Black Pine planted,
   Lebanon cedar planted area and bare land) at two soil depths (0-10 cm
   and 10-20 cm) and replicated three times. Among the soil properties
   substantially affected by the change in land cover are soil organic
   carbon, bulk density, particle density, water holding capacity and total
   porosity. Generally, soil organic carbon was observed to increase after
   afforestation. Soil organic carbon (SOC) values were 1.09\% and 1.13\%
   in Black Pine and the Cedar area, respectively. These values were
   significantly higher than the values for the bare land soils (0.54\%).
   For all types of land use, the amount of SOC in the soils decreased with
   depth. The amount of carbon sequestrated in Black Pine, Cedar and bare
   land sites at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm were 18.20 t/ha and 16.33
   t/ha, 23.54 t/ha and 1238 t/ha and 112 t/ha and 7.22 t/ha, respectively.
   The bulk density values obtained from the 0-10 cm layer soils in the
   afforested lands (1.53 g/cm(3) for Black Pine and 1.58 g/cm(3) for
   Cedar) were different from and lower than those in bare land (1.75
   g/cm(3)). Afforestation efforts led to an increase in water holding
   capacity (WHC) of the soil. Total porosity (TP) of the 0-10 cm layer
   soils increased after afforestation. This study indicated that on
   degraded land in a semiarid region, afforestation increased soil carbon
   sequestration, improved some soil properties and reduced erosion over a
   15-year period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The surface area and pore structure of easily dispersed soil particles
   <2 pm in size (water-dispersible colloids, WDCs) are important for
   carbon sequestration and transport in soil, two processes which are
   essential for the terrestrial carbon cycling. In this work, we determine
   the effects of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extractable metal
   oxides, and oxalate extractable metal oxides on the specific surface
   area (SSA) and pore structure of WDCs from silt loam topsoils of three
   TERENO test sites with a similar clay content (20\%) in Germany (arable
   (Selhausen), grassland (Rollesbroich) and forest (Wuestebach) soils).
   The N-2 gas-adsorption (-196 degrees C), small-angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and microelectrophoretic (ME)
   methods were used and compared. Results show that 1) the SSA of the WDCs
   from Selhausen, Rollesbroich, and Wuestebach decreased more after DCB
   treatment (27\%, 35\%, and 44\%) than after oxalate treatment (5\%,
   14\%, and 22\%). DCB removed metal oxide nanoparticles from WDCs were
   found to have diameters (d(p)) ranging from 4 nm to 8 nm and the surface
   loading ratios on the surface of aluminosilicate residues in WDCs were
   estimated to be 11\% to 22\% for three soils where the highest value was
   found in the acidic forest soil. 2) Pore sizes in the mesopore range (2
   nm to 50 nm) were analyzed in the WDC fractions. The results were
   discussed in terms of accessible open pores for the pristine WDCs and
   WDC samples from which metal oxide nanoparticles and organic carbon (OC)
   had been removed. The lower average pore radius (R-p) measured by the
   N-2 gas-adsorption method based on the total volume (V-t) to SSA ratio
   variations in WDCs without metal oxides compared to WDC with metal
   oxides indicated a contraction of the porous structure of WDCs due to
   the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles. The pore size distribution
   (PSD) analysis showed a sensitive contribution of metal oxide
   nanoparticles in the low range of pore sizes (<25 nm) of WDCs. In SAXS
   measurements, higher surface fractal dimensions (D-s) were observed in
   WDCs before the metal oxide's removal, which supports a roughness
   increase of the interfaces in the presence of nanopartides. The
   colloidal characterization of WDCs by the DLS and ME methods shows, at a
   pm scale, the role of positively charged metal oxide nanoparticles in
   forming WDCs with a more compact structure by decreasing the particle
   size (d(z)) and the negative zeta potential (zeta). 3) The comparison of
   R-p, k, d(z) and d(p) results between different soils also indicates the
   dependence on the clay mineralogy of WDCs so that the heterocoagulation
   between kaolinite and illite (clay minerals of different aspect ratios)
   increases the size of soil mesopores (Rollesbroich). In conclusion, the
   results of this study clearly show that the combination of the N-2
   gas-adsorption, SAXS, DLS and ME methods allows the characterization of
   soil porosity in the nanometer range where metal oxide nanopartides
   contribute to a more compact structure of WDC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The difficult question of which variables to include as a minimum data
   set of soil quality (SQ) indicators may be simplified by statistical
   methods, which allow working with databases including categorical and
   numerical variables commonly used for assessing SQ, The aims of this
   study were: i) to identify soil structural related parameters that may
   associate to SQ at different geographic areas and ii) to test the
   potential power of using decision trees in setting up a framework for SQ
   assessment, and in determining structural soil properties, visually
   evaluated, that could be included in the estimation of soil physical
   properties such as saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s). SQ was
   evaluated by visual soil assessment (VSA) in the field and a limited
   number of physical and chemical soil properties (bulk density (BD), air
   capacity, plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K-s), water stable aggregates (WSA), particle size
   distribution, soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity
   (CEC)) determined in the laboratory. Using categorical and numerical
   data of those physical, chemical and morphological properties of soils
   in both tropical and temperate areas, classification trees and model
   trees were grown. Parameters related to SQ differed between geographic
   areas. K-s was the strongest variable determining the SQ in `tropical'
   soils, but WSA, SOC and PAWC were also key variables in determining
   differences in SQ, For `temperate' soils PAWC was the only variable
   selected by the tree building algorithm. SOC, clay, and CEC were the
   discriminating variables of the model constructed from the combined data
   set. Statistically significant relationships between measured and visual
   parameters are promising in demonstrating the SQ description required
   for merging morphological, physical and chemical properties for minimum
   data set of SQ indicators. Thresholds of different predicting variables
   could be better established when SQ frameworks involve VSA. We also
   proved that prediction of K-s with a model tree was more accurate when
   morphological parameters were included as predictor variables, and that
   in that case the model tree showed a simpler structure compared to the
   tree built only from chemical and physical soil properties. In
   conclusion, decision trees are encouraging in the selection of SQ
   indicators. Moreover, including morphological properties in the
   prediction of key soil properties such as K-s seems promising. VSA could
   render morphological response variables for predicting other soil
   properties and developing SQ frameworks (agricultural interest) more
   capable of representing structural dynamic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{290-299}},

Abstract = {{The formation and stabilization of soil aggregates have a key role to
   play in adequate soil functioning. Aggregate stability (AS) is
   considered by some authors to be a property that provides information on
   soil quality. It's also a property that is highly influenced by land use
   and management. This study aims to identify the long-term changes in
   soil aggregation and related properties comparing forest and
   agricultural land use in Mediterranean calcareous soils. For the
   research, seven study sites with different soil characteristics located
   in Alicante Province (E Spain) were chosen to compare the overall effect
   of land use change from agriculture to forestry on soil aggregation. At
   every site, samples of the same soil type were collected from
   agricultural land (dry crops with conventional tillage management using
   ploughing), and nearby forest, where agriculture was abandoned between
   20 and 50 years ago. Selected physical and chemical properties like:
   texture, total content of aggregates (TCA), aggregate stability (AS),
   organic matter content (OM), carbonates, mean weight diameter (MWD) of
   aggregates and water repellency (WR) were analysed on the collected soil
   samples.
   As expected, in all soils, the AS was significantly lower in
   agricultural sites than in forest sites. But in some cases the
   differences were much higher than in others. In forest sites the AS
   varied between 46 and 82\% while in agricultural sites it ranged between
   14 and 45\%. The results showed strong positive correlation of AS with
   OM. The lowest values of AS in forest areas were found in wettable sandy
   soils. The relative increase of AS in forest soils compared to
   agricultural land use ranged from 39 to 79\%. These differences can be
   explained mainly by some soil properties, such as OM content, texture,
   and WR. In particular, the lower OM content and absence of WR are
   responsible for the lower values of AS in agricultural land use due to
   the long-term conventional tillage management. Soil WR was found in
   three of the sites, and its presence plays a key role in soil
   aggregation and its stability, especially for sandy soils. The MWD was
   in most cases higher in forest than in agricultural sites, except for
   two wettable sandy soils with the lowest initial AS. In the case of
   carbonates, no correlations were found with AS, and only in the group of
   sandy soils, significant positive correlations between carbonates and
   TCA and with MWD were found.
   In conclusion we can say that the prolonged use of conventional tillage
   management using ploughing has a strong influence on AS in all types of
   soils studied in this research. The recovery after decades of land use
   abandonment not only is dependent on how is the increase of soil OM
   content, but also is controlled by some soil properties such as the
   texture and the presence of WR. In some cases the presence of
   hydrophobic substances can play a key role in the formation and
   stabilization of soil aggregates, contributing to maintaining good
   levels of OM and avoiding higher levels of soil degradation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Adding biochar to tropical soils is a strategy for improving crop yield
   and mitigating climate change, but how various biochar types affect crop
   yield and the properties of temperate soils is still in dispute. Here,
   we evaluated how slow-pyrolysis charcoal and two biochars derived from
   energy production (gasification coke and flash-pyrolysis char) affected
   the growth of Zea mays L. and the related properties of sandy and silty
   soils within a 3-year mesocosm experiment. Fertilization was performed
   to optimize plant growth as would be done under common agricultural
   practice. Analyses included the monitoring of yield, plant and soil
   nutrients, aggregate stability, cation exchange and water holding
   capacity, and black carbon content. The results showed that the added
   biochars did not affect crop yield at an application rate of 15 g
   biochar kg(-1) of soil. Increasing the application rate of
   slow-pyrolysis charcoal to 100 g kg(-1) resulted in decreased plant
   biomass in the second and third year of the experiment, likely as a
   result of nutrient imbalances and N-immobilization. We did not detect
   any degradation of the added black carbon; however, beneficial effects
   on plants were limited by the small and transient effect of these
   biochars on the physical and chemical properties of soil. Overall, our
   results indicate that the added carbon from biochars is stored in soil,
   but all treatments tested failed to improve plant yield for the studied
   temperate soils under the given application rates and common

Abstract = {{Soil erosion by water is the main factor of land degradation,
   particularly in semi-arid regions where soil productivity is usually low
   and lowering soil quality can severely decrease crops yields. This study
   was done in an area of 900 km(2) in the semi-arid agricultural region of
   Hashtroud in northwestern Iran to determine the relationship between
   soil productivity and soil erodibility. Wheat grain yield (WGY) and soil
   erodibility factor (K) were measured separately at 108 plots in 36
   dry-farming lands under natural rainfall conditions for a two-year
   period from March 2005 to March 2007. Based on the results, significant
   differences were observed among the lands in WGY (P < 0.001) and K (P <
   0.001). These differences were attributed to variations of soil
   properties among the lands. There was a negative relationship between
   WGY and K (R-2 = 0.77). Multiple regression analysis indicated that both
   WGY and K were significantly related to aggregate stability and
   infiltration rate, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 and
   0.90, respectively. Organic matter and calcium carbonate equivalent were
   the most effective soil properties that enhanced both aggregate
   stability and infiltration rate. The study revealed that soils with a
   lower percentage of water-stable aggregates and a lower infiltration
   rate also tended to have a higher susceptibility to erosion and a lower
   potential for crop production.}},

Abstract = {{Land use changes in the Amazon region strongly impact soil
   macroinvertebrate communities, which are recognized as major drivers of
   soil functions (Lavelle et aL, 2006). To explore these relations, we
   tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to
   landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are
   linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators
   of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of
   Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon
   where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land
   use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At
   each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic
   units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and
   aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration,
   drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution;
   soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation
   was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data
   (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0.30, p < 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between
   macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia
   analysis: RV= 0.35, p<0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in
   pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and
   diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m
   (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was
   significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0.42, p<0.01), as
   was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) =0.43, p
   <0.01), Isoptera (r(2) =0.30, p<0.01), Diplopoda (r(2) =0.31, p <0.01),
   and Formicidae (r(2) = 0.13, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density
   was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) =0.38,
   p<0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r(2)<0.10).
   Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil
   macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is
   significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia,
   indicating that soil macrofauna have an engineering and/or indicator
   function. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   hydraulic conductivity}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Operation of farm machinery in agricultural fields is the main cause of
   soil compaction, which may have detrimental effects on soil gas and
   water transport. However, application of organic matter (OM) reduces the
   adverse effects of compaction and improves transport properties of soil
   gases and water. To date, experimental data on the effect of compaction
   on those transport properties and its relationship to the presence of
   applied OM remains scarce. The effect of compaction on relative gas
   diffusivity (D-p/D-0)(100) and air permeability (k(a100)) at a soil
   matric suction of -100 cm H2O (soil pF 2.0), and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (k(s)) were investigated using disturbed soil sample taken
   from 0-15 cm layer mixed with rice husk, rice straw, compost, sawdust,
   and wood bark at a rate of 20\% of the soil volume. The common
   compaction caused by farm machinery in agricultural fields was simulated
   in the laboratory using a static compression load of 150, 225, and 300
   kPa. The effect of compaction on total porosity (f) and air content at
   soil pF 2.0 (epsilon(100)) was also examined. Compaction reduced f,
   e(100), (D-p/D-0)(100), k(a100), and k(s), with the more pronounced
   significant difference between 150 and 300 kPa compactions. The decrease
   in (D-p/D-0)(100) was likely attributable to a reduced air content, and
   the decrease in k(a100) and k(s), was likely attributable to a reduced
   volume of macropores, as indicated by reduced epsilon(100) values.
   Compared with the control, addition of sawdust and wood bark seemed to
   have the most positive effect on (D-p/D-0)(100), k(a100), and k(s) in
   term of resistance to compaction, while rice straw had the opposite
   effect. The presence of OM was likely to block the soil pores and
   increase capillary water in the bottle-neck, leading to lower values of
   (D-p/D-0)(100) and k(a100) for a given value of epsilon(100)
   ({''}blockage effect{''}). These pores blocked by OM, however, seemed to
   allow the water to flow through the soil matric ({''}ceramic filter
   effect{''}). Further studies on the prolonged application of OM at field
   scale, taking into account the decomposition process, should be
   conducted. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soils can be a source or sink for the atmospheric greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) depending on the land use management, which needs to be
   understood properly for devising management strategies to mitigate
   climate change. It is hypothesized that the aggregate size distribution
   under different land use management practices and the C and N
   concentration in these aggregates may influence GHG (CO2, N2O and CH4)
   emissions from soil. To test this hypothesis, a laboratory incubation
   study was conducted using soils from a 16-year old tillage experiment on
   corn (Zea mays L) and the adjoining forest on a Crosby silt loam soil
   (Haplic Luvisols) at the Waterman Agricultural and Natural Resource
   Laboratory of the Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, Ohio. It was
   observed that in forest soil, cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions were
   significantly higher than those from the cultivated soil by 81.2 and
   100\%, respectively. However, there was no significant difference
   between conventional tillage (CT) and no till (NT) with respect to the
   cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions. Emissions were significantly higher
   from the large macro-aggregates than from other aggregate size
   fractions. There was net CH4 uptake by the soil during the incubation
   period. The cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake from
   different aggregate size fractions accounted for 59, 56, and 47\% of the
   emissions/uptake of these gases from the bulk soil, respectively. The
   contributions of the large macro-aggregates towards the bulk soil CO2
   (39\%) and N2O (37.9\%) emissions and CH4 uptake (49.7\%) were
   significantly higher than those of the micro-aggregates and mineral
   fraction. Total soil carbon, nitrogen, particulate carbon and nitrogen,

Abstract = {{Improved management of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in
   agro-ecosystems represents an important strategy for ensuring food
   security and sustainable agricultural development in China. Accurate
   estimates of the distribution of soil C and N stores and their
   relationship to crop yield are crucial to developing appropriate
   cropland management policies. The current study examined the spatial
   variation of soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TSN), and associated
   variables in the surface layer (0-40 cm) of soils from intensive
   agricultural systems in 19 counties within Henan Province, China, and
   compared these patterns with crop yield. Mean soil C and N
   concentrations were 14.9 g kg(-1) and 1.37 g kg(-1), respectively,
   whereas soil C and N stores were 4.1 kg m(-2) and 0.4 kg m(-2),
   respectively. Total crop production of each county was significantly,
   positively related to SOC, TSN, soil C and N store, and soil C and N
   stock. Soil C and N were positively correlated with soil bulk density
   but negatively correlated with soil porosity. These results indicate
   that variations in soil C could regulate crop yield in intensive
   agricultural systems, and that spatial patterns of C and N levels in
   soils may be regulated by both climatic factors and agro-ecosystem
   management. When developing suitable management programs, the importance
   of soil C and N stores and their effects on crop yield should be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{In extensive farmer-led trials practicing conservation farming (CF) in
   three regions of Zambia (Mongu: sandy soils; Kaoma: sandy or loamy sand
   soils; Mkushi: sandy loam or loamy soils), we studied the effects of
   biochar made of maize cobs (0, 2, and 6 t ha(-1) corresponding to 0,
   0.8, and 2.5\% per basin) at different fertilizer rates of NPK and urea
   on crop yield of maize (Zea mays) and groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea).
   Conservation farming in this case combines minimum tillage (how basins),
   crop rotation and residue retention. For the first time, the effect of
   biochar on in situ soil nutrient supply rates {[}determined by buried
   Plant Root Simulator (PRS (TM)) exchange resins] was studied, as well as
   the effects of biochar on elemental composition of maize. Effects of
   0-10\% (w:w) biochar addition on soil physical and soil chemical
   properties were determined in the laboratory. At all sites there was a
   consistent positive response in crop yield upon the addition of biochar.
   However, due to a great variability between farms there were no
   significant differences in absolute yields between the treatments. In
   the sandy soils at Mongu, relative yields (i.e., percentage yield with
   biochar relative to the same fertilizer rate without biochar) of maize
   grains and maize stover were significantly increased at recommended
   fertilizer rates (232 +/- 60\%) and at half the recommended rate (128
   +/- 6\%), respectively. In addition, biochar significantly increased
   concentrations of K and P in maize stover. In situ soil nutrient supply
   rates as measured by PRS (TM)-probes were highly spatially variable with
   no consistent effects of the different treatments in the three regions.
   By contrast, the fraction of plant available water (Vol.-\%)
   significantly increased upon the addition of biochar in all three soils.
   The increase caused by 10\% biochar addition was of factor 2.5 in Mongu
   (from 4.5\% to 11.2\%) and 1.2 in both Kaoma (from 14.7\% to 18.2\%) and
   Mkushi (from 18.2\% to 22.7\%). Cation exchange capacity, pH, and
   exchangeable K significantly increased upon the addition of 10\% (w: w)
   biochar in all three regions with a subsequent increase in base
   saturation and decrease of available Al3+. Our findings suggest that the
   addition of biochar in combination with CF might have a positive impact
   on crop growth and that this positive effect is mainly caused by
   increases in plant-available water and decreased available Al.}},

Abstract = {{Investments in restoring native vegetation must increasingly allow for
   likely impacts of climate change, requiring re-evaluation of limits to
   ecological recovery and persistence. Nutrient enrichment and weed
   invasion are significant limits to restoration in mesic ecosystems, but
   in a drying climate, limits could shift towards more fundamental
   ecosystem functions. We used a state and transition framework to
   identify landuse-related changes in topsoil biophysical characteristics
   likely to influence climate resilience in mesic temperate eucalypt
   woodlands.
   We compared topsoil condition in little-modified `reference' states of
   the native ground-layer (dominated by tall tussock grasses) with four
   degraded ground-layer states identified in our state and transition
   framework. We hypothesized that `nutrient-depleted' states (dominated by
   short tussock grasses) and `nutrient-enriched' states (dominated by
   exotic annuals) would exhibit characteristics reflecting increased and
   decreased ecosystem vulnerability to a drying climate respectively.
   Our hypothesis that nutrient-depleted states are more vulnerable to a
   drying climate was supported by their significantly slower soil-water
   infiltration rates and significantly lower levels of topsoil carbon,
   clay, micro-invertebrates, microbial activity and modeled water holding
   capacity than reference states. However, degradation was less pronounced
   beneath trees, and our prediction regarding enriched states was
   supported only for carbon.
   Topsoil biophysical characteristics associated with different
   ground-layer states are predictable using a state and transition
   framework. Climate resilience of nutrient-depleted states appears
   compromised by topsoil biophysical degradation, indicating increasing
   need for attention in mesic ecosystems predicted to become drier under

Abstract = {{Modern alley cropping designs, with trees aligned in rows and adapted to

   explores the potential for adoption of cork oak (Quercus suber L.)
   agroforestry in Portugal and estimates the potential carbon
   sequestration. Spatial modeling and Portuguese datasets were used to
   estimate target areas where cork oak could grow on farmland. Different
   implementation scenarios were then modeled for this area assuming a
   modern silvoarable agroforestry system (113 trees ha(-1) thinned at year
   20 for establishing 50 trees ha(-1)). The YieldSAFE process-based model
   was used to predict the biomass and carbon yield of cork oak under low
   and high soil water holding capacity levels. Approximately 353,000 ha
   are available in Portugal for new cork oak alley cropping. Assuming
   implementation rates between 10 \% of the area with low soil water
   capacity (60 mm: 15 cm depth, coarse texture) and 70 \% of the area with
   high soil water holding capacity (1,228 mm: 200 cm depth, very fine
   texture), then carbon sequestration could be 5 x 10(6) and 123 x 10(6)
   Mg CO2 respectively. Due to higher yields on more productive land,
   scenarios of limited implementation in high productivity locations can
   sequester similar amounts of carbon as wide implementation on low

Abstract = {{Current environmental research is paying increasing attention to
   reliable analytical surrogates of soil quality. In this work a series of
   molecular features of soil organic matter were studied in different soil
   types from Central Spain with the purpose of identifying the soil
   functions most closely correlated with specific pools of soil organic
   matter and their structural characteristics. Soil physical variables
   including bulk density, total porosity, aggregate stability, available
   water capacity and water infiltration parameters (Kostiakov's equation
   coefficients) were determined. The major soil organic fractions (lipids,
   particulate free organic matter, fulvic acids, humic acids and humin)
   were quantified using standard procedures and the soil organic matter
   was characterised by spectroscopic techniques. Statistical data
   treatments including simple regression, canonical correlation models and
   multidimensional scaling suggested two well-defined groups of physical
   properties in the studied soils: (i) those associated with organic
   matter of predominantly aromatic character (e.g., water infiltration
   descriptors), and (ii) soil physical variables related to organic matter
   with marked aliphatic character and comparatively low degree of
   humification (e.g., porosity, aggregate stability, available water
   capacity and field air capacity). From the practical viewpoint, the
   results support the idea that the detailed structural study of the soil
   organic matter is useful for accurately monitoring soil physical status.
   The only determination of total soil organic carbon ought to be
   complemented with qualitative analyses of the organic matter fractions,
   at least at the spectroscopic level, which to large extent help to
   explain the origin of the variability in soil physical properties and
   can be used for the early diagnosis of possible degradation processes.

Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{151-160}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lignite and lignite humic acids, which are used as soil amendments
   sometimes, are supposed to improve soil properties such as water holding
   capacity. The structure of those materials is composed of various
   organic molecules stabilized mostly by weak interactions. Therefore,
   excess of water causes only partial swelling, but most of the physical
   structure is destabilized. This accelerates the desiccation and hampers
   their application as natural hydrogel-like substances. In order to
   stabilize the structure of lignite humic acids and improve the water
   holding capacity, we applied formaldehyde cross-linking procedure based
   on covalent coupling of aromatic humic adds moieties. By combining the
   H-1 NMR relaxomeny and methods of thermal analysis, the kinetics and
   degree of hydration, water distribution and moisture uptake were
   investigated. It was found that cross-linking induced a reduction in
   moisture sorption capacity at low relative humidity and an increase at
   higher relative humidity, which was attributed to the separation of
   functional groups and decreasing of structural compactness after
   cross-linking. As a result, the cross-linked humic acids, exhibited
   faster water uptake and approximately three-fold higher water holding
   capacity in comparison with the parental sample. The distribution of
   relaxation times of water protons in swollen humic acids revealed the
   unification of pore size distribution upon cross-linking. Although the
   improved hydration of cross-linked lignite humic acids already resembles
   the hydration of some hydrophilic polymers, the water holding capacity
   is still below the capacity of classical hydrogels. Nevertheless, the
   low price of lignite, sorption properties and its overall positive

Abstract = {{Pig slurry applied to soil at different rates may affect soil properties
   and the mobility of chemical compounds within the soil. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate the effects of rates of pig slurry
   application in agricultural areas on soil physical and chemical
   properties and on the mobility of glyphosate through the soil profile.
   The study was carried out in the 12 th year of an experiment with pig
   slurry applied at rates of 0 (control), 50, 100 and 200 m(3) ha(-1)
   yr(-1) on a Latossolo Vermelho distrofico (Hapludox) soil. In the
   control, the quantities of P and K removed by harvested grains were
   replaced in the next crop cycle. Soil physical properties (bulk density,
   porosity, texture, and saturated hydraulic conductivity) and chemical
   properties (organic matter, pH, extractable P, and exchangeable K) were
   measured. Soil solution samples were collected at depths of 20, 40 and
   80 cm using suction lysimeters, and glyphosate concentrations were
   measured over a 60-day period after slurry application. Soil physical
   and chemical properties were little affected by the pig slurry
   applications, but soil pH was reduced and P levels increased in the
   surface layers. In turn, K levels were increased in sub-surface layers.
   Glyphosate concentrations tended to decrease over time but were not
   affected by pig slurry application. The concentrations of glyphosate
   found in different depths show that the pratice of this application in
   agricultural soils has the potential for contamination of groundwater,
   especially when the water table is the surface and heavy rains occur
   immediately after application.}},

Abstract = {{Removing agricultural cellulosic residues from fields for the production
   of second generation biofuels'has the potential to profoundly alter C
   and N cycling in soil, increasing the risk of soil organic matter
   depletion and favoring soil-atmosphere gaseous exchanges. However, these
   negative impacts could potentially be offset by amending the soil with
   the solid by-product which is generated during bioethanol production. In
   a 100days laboratory study, we investigated the fate of C and N after
   soil amendment with doubly labeled (C-13, N-15) wheat residue (WR) and
   the corresponding bioethanol by-product (i.e. nonfermentable wheat
   residue NFWR) with and without extra N addition. Substituting WR with
   the corresponding amount of recovered bioethanol by-product partially
   compensated the C losses of full crop residue removal. When the
   equivalent amount of C was added as WR and NFWR, NFWR-derived C was
   found in significantly higher proportion in macroaggregates in soil
   (17.0 vs. 8.9\%) after 100days. Addition of both WR and NFWR reduced
   soil organic C (SOC) mineralization, i.e. it caused a negative priming
   effect in soil. However, this pattern was reversed when extra N was
   added. Both WR and NFWR increased the proportion of soil water-stable
   macroaggregates from 16\% (in control) to 20-24\% (in the different
   treatments). The results suggest that the more recalcitrant compounds
   derived from bioethanol production may stabilize more strongly and
   persist within the protected fractions of SOM pools. Our study
   demonstrates that NFWR, compared with WR application, neither increased
   N2O emissions nor had a negative impact on aggregate formation in the
   midterm. This demonstrates that NFWR has potential for replenishing SOC
   stocks.}},

   PAHs in industrial soils was 1.2, 1.5, 1.6 and 2.3 times higher than
   those in soils from wharf, cropland, milldam and natural wetland sites,
   respectively. Greater accumulation of PAHs occurred in the middle and/or

   also exhibited the highest toxic levels with the highest toxic
   equivalent concentrations of PAHs, followed by wharf and milldam soils,
   and the cropland and wetland soils had the lowest toxicity. The
   diagnostic ratios suggested that PAHs primarily originated from biomass
   and coal combustion at industrial and milldam sites, and petroleum
   combustion was determined to be the primary source of PAHs at the wharf,
   cropland and wetland sites. Both 3-ring and 4-ring PAHs in the milldam

Abstract = {{Soil erosion, low phosphorus fertility, and soil moisture stress during
   winter season are among major limitations to high crop production and
   sustainable land management in North Eastern Hill (NEH) region of India.
   Thus, a two years (2009-2011) field study was conducted on a terraced
   land (980 m a.s.l.) to study the impact of land configuration, tillage
   and residue management on soil properties under rainfed
   groundnut-rapeseed cropping system. The treatments were: (i) farmers'
   practice (FP) (flat bed - residue removal, 3-4 times ploughing); (ii)
   broad bed and furrow (BBF) with in situ residue incorporation; (iii) BBF
   with in situ residue + hedge leaves \{white hoary pea, Tephrosia candida
   (Roxb.) DC\} incorporation; (iv) BBF with in situ residue + hedge leaves
   mulching (no-till, NT); (v) raised bed (RB) with in situ residue
   incorporation; (vi) RB with in situ residue + hedge leaves
   incorporation; (vii) RB with in situ residue + hedge leaves mulching
   (NT). Soil profile moisture content was higher under residue
   retention/incorporation and altered land configuration than that under
   FP. Water infiltration rate (11.2 mm/h) and hydraulic conductivity (6.98
   mm/h) in soil under RB with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) were
   significantly higher (P = 0.05), than that under FP (7.65 mm/h and 3.35
   mm/h) after two cropping cycles. Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC)
   was significantly higher under RB with residue + hedge leaves
   incorporation (3811.1 mu g/g soil and 276 mu g/g soil) than that under
   FP. Dehydrogenase activity (DHA) was the highest in RB with residue +
   hedge leaves mulching (NT) (57.8 mu g TPF/g soil/24 h). Soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and nutrient content improved under residue management. RB
   with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) resulted in the maximum SOC
   stock, and it was 2.0 Mg/ha and 2.7 Mg/ha higher than that of the
   antecedent level and FP, respectively. The average groundnut equivalent
   yield (GEY) was significantly the highest in RB with residue + hedge
   leaves incorporation (2815 kg/ha) followed by that under RB with residue
   incorporation (2747 kg/ha). Water use efficiency (WUE) of rapeseed was
   the maximum in RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation (4.64 kg/ha
   - mm) and the minimum under FP (1.49 kg/ha - mm). The BBF and RB land
   configurations along with residue and hedge leaves mulching under NT
   improved soil quality and was the most suitable for higher returns of
   groundnut-rapeseed system under rainfed mid-hills condition. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Nitrate removal from runoff from agricultural land is in general
   required to reach a ``good chemical status{''} of surface and
   groundwater bodies according to the European Water Framework Directive.
   Removing nitrates via heterotrophic denitrification is highly effective
   but requires stable anoxic environmental conditions as well as available
   organic carbon as electron donator. Constructed wetlands (CWs),
   established on peat soils, through which the nitrate-loaded water is
   routed, may provide denitrification favorable conditions. To study
   nitrate turnover, hydraulic properties and possible negative side
   effects of CWs on formerly drained fens, we developed a mesocosm
   experiment with vertical flow and an open water surface. The first
   flushing of nitrate during the exchange of the initial pore volume was
   quantified with 0.58 g NO3-N kg(-1) organic substance. Both nitrate and
   sulfate were released faster and in higher concentrations than DOC and
   with a ratio corresponding to the composition of the peat. Redox
   potential measurements revealed that denitrifying conditions established
   in certain soil depths after roughly 40 days of continuous flux.
   Transport properties were obtained from analyzing tracer breakthrough
   curves. It could be demonstrated that the degraded peat had a dual
   porosity structure. Subjected to nitrate enriched water for two years,
   the immobile pore water fraction increased from 40 to 80\% probably
   because of physical consolidation processes and microbial activity and
   subsequent clogging of pores. This was not considered as negative since
   denitrification processes are believed to preferably operate in
   immobile, oxygen depleted water regions. We concluded that the first
   flushing of mineralized nitrate upon rewetting after onset of flux may
   compromise any positive clean up and nitrate removal effects occurring
   during long-term operation of peat-wetlands. It is thus advisable to
   recycle the water during early stages of the establishment of
   constructed wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of soil water dynamics can be valuable tools for
   the assessment of different soil and land management practices. For
   accurate simulations, the soil hydraulic properties (SHP), i.e. the
   hydraulic conductivity and water retention function have to be properly
   known. They can be either estimated from physical soil properties by
   pedotransfer functions (PTF) or measured. In most studies, soil profiles
   are analyzed and sampled with respect to their pedogenic horizons. While
   considerable effort has been put on horizontal spatial SHP variations,
   vertical changes within soil profiles have not been analyzed in detail.
   Therefore, the objectives of this study were (i) the SHP measurement
   along vertical transects within two soil profiles, (ii) to evaluate
   their spatial variation and correlation with physical soil properties,
   and (iii) to assess the impact of the SHP determination method and its
   spatial discretization on simulated soil water balance components. Two
   soils, an agriculturally used silty-loam Chernozem and a forested sandy
   Cambisol were sampled in 0.05 m increments along vertical transects. The
   parameters of a dual porosity model were derived using the evaporation
   method and scaling was applied to derive representative mean SHP
   parameters and scaling factors as a measure of spatial variability.
   State-space models described spatial variations of the scaling factors
   by physical soil properties. Simulations with HYDRUS 1D delivered the
   soil water balance for different climatic conditions with the SHP being
   estimated from horizon-wise PTFs, or discretized either sample-wise,
   according to the pedogenic horizons, or as hydrologically relevant units
   (hydropedological approach). Considerable SHP variations were found for
   both soil profiles. In the Chernozem, variations of the hydraulic
   conductivity were largest within the ploughed Ap-horizon and could be
   attributed to variations in soil structure (macropores). In the subsoil,
   soil water retention showed a gradual decrease within each horizon. The
   observed water retention variations could be described by state-space
   models that comprised the contents of clay and total carbon, whereas
   variations of the hydraulic conductivity were described by clay content
   and total porosity. The hydraulic conductivity in the Cambisol was
   slightly undulating throughout the profile. Here, water retention was
   largest in the upper part of the profile and considerably decreased
   within the lower part of the Bhs-horizon. Simulated soil water balance
   components differed distinctly between the SHP discretizations. Compared
   to observed soil water contents, the simulations where the SHP were
   given by small-scale layers or hydropedological units performed best for
   both experimental sites. The different SHP discretizations mainly
   affected the estimated drainage losses and the simulated crop
   transpiration under medium to dry climatic conditions. The study
   confirmed the importance of an adequate spatial SHP discretization. The
   results indicate that SHP estimations by PTFs or the standard
   horizon-mean sampling strategy might fail to parameterize soil water
   simulations, especially in structured soils. The presented
   hydropedological approach showed a way to receive good simulation
   results by reducing the SHP observation density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A study of soil physical, chemical and biological properties of five
   cultivated agro-ecosystems (two conventional potato, two organic potato
   and one cereal production systems) and two uncultivated agro-ecosystems

   sites over 3 yr in New Brunswick, Canada. Twenty-four of the initial 42
   variables chosen for their significant response to differences among
   farming systems were used in a principal component analysis to
   understand their relationships with the agro-ecosystems studied. The
   chemical, physical and biological soil properties considered contributed
   to a single dominant factor (PCI) of agricultural soil health
   representing soil organic matter dynamics. Conventional, uncertified
   organic and certified organic potato agro-ecosystems were lowest,
   intermediate and highest, respectively, on the PCI gradient.
   Conventional potato systems were characterized by high erosion, high
   soil bulk density, high soil test sulphur and phosphorus and high
   bacterial counts. Certified organic potato systems formed a separate
   group with the reference ecosystems (i.e., pasture and abandoned potato
   field under long-term rejuvenation). This group was characterized by
   high soil organic carbon, high soil aggregate stability, high soil
   water-holding capacity and high meso-and macro-fauna counts. The
   uncertified organic potato production system and organic barley system
   were characterized by average values, intermediate between conventional
   and certified organic potato systems. Results confirmed the strong
   negative impact of intensive cycles of conventional potato production on
   soil health. The clear separation observed between conventional,
   uncertified organic and organic potato ecosystems indicates that the
   positive impact of rotations and other management practices must be
   sustained over long periods for full rehabilitation of soils previously
   under intensive potato production. However, results also revealed that

Abstract = {{Soil physical quality (SPQ) is often ignored or under-monitored in

   suite of complementary soil physical and hydraulic parameters was
   measured using intact core samples to determine the SPQ of a Brookston
   clay loam under a long-term (48 yr) cropping, fertilization and land
   management study at Woodslee, Ontario. The SPQ under virgin woodlot,
   fertilized monoculture sod and unfertilized monoculture sod treatments
   was similar, with optimal SPQ occurring in the top 10-20 cm, but
   severely suboptimal SPQ occurring below 30 cm because bulk density (BD),
   relative field capacity (RFC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S)
   were excessive, and because organic carbon (OC), air capacity (AC) and
   plant-available water capacity (PAWC) were critically low. The SPQ for
   fertilized and unfertilized monoculture corn under fall moldboard plow
   tillage was similar and substantially suboptimal throughout the top
   40-50 cm due to high or excessive BD and RFC, critically low OC, low or
   critically low AC and PAWC, and KS that varied erratically from
   excessive to critically low. The SPQ under fertilized and unfertilized
   corn-oat-alfalfa-alfalfa rotations (corn and second-year alfalfa fall
   plowed) was similar and largely non-optimal below 10 cm, but largely
   optimal in the top 10 cm due to the ameliorating effects of numerous
   biopores and crop roots. A bimodal soil water release function fitted to
   release curve data showed that PAWC was determined by soil matrix
   porosity (P-M), and AC was determined by soil structure porosity (P-S).
   Strong inverse linear correlations between BD vs. P-M, BD vs. PS and BD
   vs. OC provided site-specific estimates of optimal ranges and critical
   limits for PAWC, AC and OC, respectively. Although SPQ changed
   substantially among treatments, the changes did not extend below 30- to
   40-cm depth, and were largely unaffected by long-term annual
   fertilization. The SPQ below 30- to 40-cm depth was similarly poor
   across all treatments, and is likely an inherent characteristic of the

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) content in paddy soils is higher than that in
   upland soils in tropical and subtropical China. The dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) concentration, however, is lower in paddy soils. We
   hypothesize that soil moisture strongly controls the fate of DOM, and
   thereby leads to differences between the two agricultural soils under
   contrasting management regimens.
   A 100-day incubation experiment was conducted to trace the fate and
   biodegradability of DOM in paddy and upland soils under three moisture
   levels: 45\%, 75\%, and 105\% of the water holding capacity (WHC). C-14
   labeled DOM, extracted from the C-14 labeled rice plant material, was
   incubated in paddy and upland soils, and the mineralization to
   (CO2)-C-14 and incorporation into microbial biomass were analyzed.
   Labile and refractory components of the initial C-14 labeled DOM and
   their respective half-lives were calculated by a double exponential
   model.
   During incubation, the mineralization of the initial C-14 labeled DOM in
   the paddy soils was more affected by moisture than in the upland soils.
   The amount of C-14 incorporated into the microbial biomass (2.4-11.0\%
   of the initial DOM-C-14 activity) was less affected by moisture in the
   paddy soils than in the upland soils. At any of the moisture levels, 1)
   the mineralization of DOM to (CO2)-C-14 within 100 days was 1.2-2.1-fold
   higher in the paddy soils (41.9-60.0\% of the initial DOM-C-14 activity)
   than in the upland soils (28.7-35.7\%), 2) C-14 activity remaining in
   solution was significantly lower in the paddy soils than in the upland
   soils, and 3) C-14 activity remaining in the same agricultural soil
   solution was not significantly different among the three moisture levels
   after 20 days. Therefore, moisture strongly controls DOM fate, but
   moisture was not the key factor in determining the lower DOM in the
   paddy soils than in the upland soils.
   The UV absorbance of DOM at 280 nm indicates less aromaticity of DOM
   from the paddy soils than from the upland soils. At any of the moisture
   levels, much more labile DOM was found in paddy soils (343-49.2\% of the
   initial C-14 labeled DOM) compared with that in upland soils
   (19.4-23.9\%). This demonstrates that the lower DOM content in the paddy
   soil compared with that in the upland soil is probably determined by the
   less complex components and structure of the DOM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{A comparison of methods to assess susceptibility to soil sealing}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{226}},
Pages = {{397-404}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many methods and indices have been developed for assessing seal
   formation. However, difficulties persist in selecting a suitable method
   because of the effect of the procedure on the results. The present study
   aims to evaluate appropriate soil sealing assessment methods that enable
   to distinguish the surface condition of soils with contrasting
   characteristics. A comparative study was conducted among the most
   frequently used methods, viz: wet sieving tests, raindrop impact tests
   under field and laboratory conditions, penetration resistance (PR),
   consistency index (C5-10), soil stability index (StI), and crusting
   index (CI). Different agricultural Venezuelan `tropical' soils were
   ranked according to their susceptibility to soil sealing. The ranking
   and the correlation between the parameters were used to assess and
   compare soil sealing formation measured by the different methods.
   According to multiple and single wet sieving tests the soils were
   classified into two groups as stable (kaolinitic-rich) and unstable
   (smectitic-rich) soils. The ranking of the soils and correlation
   analysis (p < 0.05) indicated that aggregate stability as determined by
   wet sieving, infiltration rate, runoff and soil loss under laboratory
   and field conditions was effective in predicting seal formation among
   smectitic-rich loam to kaolinitic-rich clayey soils. C5-10 and PR were
   not comparable tests for sealing formation (p > 0.05). The StI that
   considers soil organic matter (SOM) as the most important factor to
   maintain soil structure did not reflect the high stability of the
   kaolinitic-rich soil that lacks SOM. The CI, which indicates the risk
   for soil crusting formation in the function of silt fractions, is a more
   capable indicator for evaluating susceptibility to sealing of our soils.
   This study further proposes that when topsoil aggregates are
   characterized by high silt and smectite contents the use of wet sieving
   and raindrop impact tests or simple indices such as StI and CI can
   satisfactorily assess the susceptibility to seal formation. Differences
   obtained in seal formation ranking indicated that method selection
   impacts the measured value. It can therefore be recommended to take the
   effect of the method into account when interpreting the results
   obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of organic matter has been recognized as being a major threat to
   soils in Europe with important consequences for the physical functioning
   of soils. We present the result of a numerical analysis of the
   integrated effects of changes in soil porosity and soil water status,
   along with decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent
   changes in the risk of compaction. This study concerns the impact of
   straw exportation on the risk of soil compaction. We evaluated the risk
   of compaction of a cultivated Eutric Cambisol in Northern France having
   a dominant silt loam soil texture, by simulating vehicle wheeling during
   sugar beet cropping for contrasting soil organic carbon contents (4.7,
   11.1 and 23.4 g kg(-1)). To do this, we coupled two models: (1) a crop
   model (STICS) to calculate the changes in the water content of the 0-30
   cm depth layer; and (2) a compaction model (COMPSOIL) to calculate soil
   stresses as a function of vehicle characteristics. Our study suggests
   that a decrease in SOC reduces the risk of topsoil deformation due to a
   decrease in soil water content, which tends to augment soil
   precompression stress. The method requires improvement in the future
   because it is very sensitive to input parameters for soil physical
   properties. Nevertheless it provides the first method for evaluating the
   impact of SOC decline on soil compaction. Its genericity permits it
   further applications to various soil management practices that decrease
   SOC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural sustainability rests on the principle that the needs of the
   present population can be met while protecting the ability of future
   generations to meet their needs. Consequently, soil sustainability is
   paramount to assuring continued agricultural production. Soil structure
   and C storage can be influenced by producers' choices regarding residue
   and water management techniques. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the long-term effects of alternative residue (i.e., tillage,
   residue burning, and fertility-residue level) and water management
   (irrigated and dryland) practices and soil depth after 10 yr of
   consistent management on total water-stable aggregate (TWSA; >0.25 mm)
   concentrations, size-separated aggregate concentrations, and
   corresponding C and N concentrations in a wheat (Triticum aestivum
   L.)-soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] double-crop production system in
   the lower Mississippi River Delta region of eastern Arkansas. The TWSA
   concentration was unaffected by residue burning and not always
   negatively impacted by conventional tillage (CT). The TWSA
   concentrations were 19\% greater (P < 0.05) under CT than no-tillage
   (NT) within the dryland low-fertility-residue treatment combination.
   High-fertility-residue resulted in 18\% less (P < 0.05) TWSA than under
   low-fertility-residue within the irrigated-NT treatment combination.
   Under high-fertility-residue, TWSA concentrations were 13\% less (P <
   0.05) in the 5- to 10-cm depth under irrigation and were 10\% less (P <
   0.05) in the top 5 cm under dryland management compared to the
   low-fertility-residue treatment. The smallest two size classes (0.25-0.5
   and 0.5-1.0 mm) comprised over 80\% of the TWSA. Water-stable aggregate
   concentrations in the largest two size classes (1-2 and >2 mm) were
   unaffected by all treatments imposed. Results of this study indicate
   that interactions between long-term residue and water management
   practices can significantly impact soil aggregate stability, and thus
   are useful for aiding the determination of long-term agricultural
   management practices that improve soil quality in the Lower Mississippi
   River Delta region.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate leaching (NL) is a major concern in agriculture due to its
   impact on human health and ecosystems. Solute movement through soil is
   governed by various hydraulic and physical properties that determine
   water flow. To study such relationships, a pedotransfer function of
   groundwater pollution was developed in two alluvial irrigated soils
   under long-term pig slurry applications. Two basins of central Chile,
   San Pedro (Typic Xerochrepts) and Pichidegua Xerofluvents) were
   selected, where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown in spring-summer, while
   during autumn-winter period a ryegrass-barley-oat mixed crop was
   established in San Pedro and a fallow management applied in Pichidegua.
   Soils in cultivated and control sites were characterized in physical and
   hydraulic terms. Nitrogen and water budgets were determined measuring
   periodically (biweekly) N concentration (N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and
   monitoring water contents in soil profiles, respectively. Dye tracer
   tests were performed with brilliant blue (BB) dye and the staining
   patterns analyzed. To contrast the effect of slurry additions over soil
   physical properties and over NL, t-Student tests were performed. Some
   accurate pollution groundwater NL pedotransfer functions were obtained
   calculated through least square fit models and artificial neural
   networks. Textural porosity, mean diameter variation, slow drainage
   porosity, air conductivity at 33 kPa water tension and N-NO3-
   concentrations were directly related to NL. In terms of preferential
   flow analysis, stained path width > 200 mm was inversely associated to
   NL. Finally, dye tracer tests provided a better understanding of the

Abstract = {{Soil CO2 emission (FCO2) is a main contributor of atmospheric carbon
   transfer and is the subject of research aimed at developing effective
   methods for characterizing and mitigating CO2 emissions. The FCO2 is
   related to various soil properties including porosity, density and
   moisture, which are in turn related to gas transfer, O-2 uptake and CO2
   release, as well as mineralogical components (particularly iron oxides,
   which are closely associated with aggregation and protection of soil
   organic matter). As estimated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS),
   soil iron oxides such as hematite (Hm) and goethite (Gt) can be useful
   in determining FCO2. The main objective of this experiment was to assess
   the usefulness of the mineralogical properties Hm, Gt, and iron oxides
   extracted by dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (Fe-d) to estimate the FCO2
   in a sugarcane area under green harvest in southeastern Brazil. The
   experiment was conducted using an irregular 50 m x 50 m grid containing
   89 sampling points 0.50-10 m apart to assess the soil properties. The
   FCO2 at each sampling point was measured at the beginning of crop growth
   and 54 days after planting with the use of two portable LI-COR LI-8100
   Soil CO2 Flux Systems. The soil properties studied were found to be
   spatially dependent and exhibited well-defined anisotropy (particularly
   the mineralogical properties Hm, Gt and Fe-d). The first two components
   of a principal component analysis (PC1 and PC2) jointly accounted for
   73.4\% of the overall result variability with PC1 essentially related to
   the physical and mineralogical properties of the soil. Based on a
   multiple linear regression analysis, free water porosity (FWP) and Hm
   accounted for 71\% of the FCO2 variability. Our results indicate that
   soil preparation and management practices in mechanically harvested
   sugarcane affect some factors inherent in the soil forming processes,
   including physical and mineralogical properties, which in turn affect
   FCO2. These results affirm the potential of DRS as an auxiliary tool for
   determination of properties that are typically associated with FCO2. In
   addition, the ensuing method allows for large-area FCO2 mapping to
   developing greenhouse gas emission inventories for agricultural soils.

Abstract = {{Following gas generation in a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF),
   C-14-containing gases could migrate through the geosphere, eventually
   diffusing into soils at the Earth's surface. This paper reports summary
   results from laboratory and field experiments to obtain information on
   the probable rates of a) diffusive transport and b) oxidation of
   (CH4)-C-12/13 (as a surrogate for (CH4)-C-14) in a typical agricultural
   soil in the UK. Rates of CH4 oxidation were generally low in the field
   and undisturbed soil columns, though a re-packed column of homogenised
   topsoil oxidised ambient atmospheric CH4 20x faster than an undisturbed
   soil column. In contrast to low observed rates of CH4 oxidation, the
   effective diffusion of CH4 through the soil was rapid. Isotopically
   labelled CH4 injected at a depth of 45 cm in the field diffused to the
   surface and exited the soil over a time period ranging from 8 to 24 h.
   The rate of CH4 diffusion through the soil was increased by the presence
   of ryegrass roots which increased soil porosity and decreased water
   content. delta C-13 values for laboratory column soils after labelled
   CH4 injection experiments showed no sign of residual C-13, despite the
   extremely high delta C-13 values of the injected (CH4)-C-12/13. If
   laboratory observations are confirmed by measurements in field samples
   it can be concluded that the majority of (CH4)-C-14 from a GDF which
   enters a soil with low methanotrophic activity will be lost to the free
   atmosphere after diffusing rapidly through the soil column. (c) 2013

   plots and species to subplots. Organic farming (20.34 t ha(-1)) produced
   significantly higher yield over conventional practice (18.64 t ha(-1))
   by 9\%. All the species responded well to organic management, which
   lowered the bulk density and particle density slightly and improved the
   water holding capacity (by 15\%) of soil. Tuber quality was improved
   with significantly higher Ca (72.67 mg 100g(-1)), slightly higher dry
   matter, crude protein, K and Mg contents. Organic plots showed
   significantly higher available K, by 34\% and pH, by 0.46 unit and
   higher soil organic matter by 14\%. The dehydrogenase enzyme activity

Abstract = {{Information about the changes in soil properties upon change in the
   agricultural management system is essential for sustainability of the
   system. The long-term (15 years) impact of zero tillage in wheat under
   rice-wheat cropping system in semi-arid region of Indo-Gangetic Plains
   (IGP) was evaluated for physical properties, organic carbon build up,
   root growth and wheat productivity in different textured soils. The
   conventional (CT, two harrowing, one cultivator and planking) and zero
   tillage (ZT, direct drilling) systems were investigated.
   ZT increased soil organic carbon significantly to a depth of 0.10, 0.15
   and 0.25 m in sandy loam, loam and clay loam soil, respectively,
   indicating its buildup to deeper depths with increase in fineness of
   soil texture. Carbon stock in surface 0.4 m soil depth increased by
   19.0, 34.7 and 38.8\% over CT in 15 years in sandy loam, loam and clay
   loam soil, respectively. The corresponding carbon sequestration rates
   were 0.24, 0.46 and 0.62 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). It reduced the plough pan,
   however, a significant increase in bulk density was observed in surface
   0.05 m in sandy loam and 0.10 m in both loam and clay loam soils. Water
   dispersible silt + clay reduced indicating better soil aggregation.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivity increased significantly only to a depth
   of 0.10 m but with varying magnitudes. Increase in magnitude in surface
   0.05 m layer was highest in loam (51\%) followed by sandy loam (40\%)
   and clay loam (38\%) soil. Although ZT increased water retention and
   aeration porosity but increase in field water capacity was significant
   to a deeper depth (0.15 m) in clay loam soil. Water intake rate also
   increased significantly in clay loam soil (28\%) over CT. The root
   biomass increased significantly and the highest increase was recorded in
   loam (81\%) followed by sandy loam (70\%) and clay loam (42\%) soil. In
   addition, if encouraged roots to penetration deeper in the soils.
   In spite of improved soil physical properties and root growth under ZT,
   the significant increase in mass of grains and consequently the wheat
   yield, was observed only in clay loam soil indicating that the physical
   properties of other soils under CT have not reached to a stage limiting
   plant growth and yields. Study concludes that the ZT practice in wheat
   under rice-wheat system of semi-arid region of IGP in Haryana may be
   adopted for sustaining productivity of the system but the implementation
   of the practice must be promoted in fine textured soils. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Cropping practice (tillage) is an important management tool for tackling
   water induced erosion hazard, promoting in situ water conservation and
   improving and stabilising crop yields from rainfed production systems of
   semiarid and subtropical regions. Four practices including conventional
   tillage (CT), ridge farming tillage (RFT), no tillage (NT) and stubble
   mulch farming tillage (SMFT) were evaluated for 11 years (1990-1991 to
   2001-2002) under semiarid rainfed conditions in western India on a very
   deep, sandy loam soil. Green gram(1) (Vigna radiata)-mustard (Brassica
   juncea) sequential cropping and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) +
   pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping systems were tested for the
   first four years (first phase of the experiment). Cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata)-mustard sequential cropping and cowpea + castor (Ricinus
   communis) intercropping systems were used for the following seven years
   (second phase of the experiment). Runoff, soil losses, sediment
   concentrations, crop yields, soil organic carbon, bulk density and water
   stable aggregates were observed for all the treatment combinations. RFT
   and SMFT were both effective in reducing runoff and soil loss. RFT, NT
   and SMFT reduced runoff by 69.4, 16.2 and 59.6\% respectively compared
   with CT. Average soil loss in NT was 37.2\% less than CT. Average
   sediment concentration of runoff during June-July was greater than in
   August-October for all treatments and average sediment concentrations
   were greater under CT and RFT. The highest average yield of all crops
   except green gram was recorded under SMFT. Surface soil organic carbon
   (SOC), bulk density and water stable macro-aggregates were all

   processes controlling contaminant cycling in Mancos Shale, southwestern
   United States, with emphasis on salinity and selenium}},

Abstract = {{Soils derived from black shale can accumulate high concentrations of
   elements of environmental concern, especially in regions with semiarid
   to arid climates. One such region is the Colorado River basin in the
   southwestern United States where contaminants pose a threat to
   agriculture, municipal water supplies, endangered aquatic species, and
   water-quality commitments to Mexico. Exposures of Cretaceous Mancos
   Shale (MS) in the upper basin are a major contributor of salinity and
   selenium in the Colorado River. Here, we examine the roles of geology,
   climate, and alluviation on contaminant cycling (emphasis on salinity
   and Se) during weathering of MS in a Colorado River tributary watershed.
   Stage I (incipient weathering) began perhaps as long ago as 20 ka when
   lowering of groundwater resulted in oxidation of pyrite and organic
   matter. This process formed gypsum and soluble organic matter that
   persist in the unsaturated, weathered shale today. Enrichment of Se
   observed in laterally persistent ferric oxide layers likely is due to
   selenite adsorption onto the oxides that formed during fluctuating redox
   conditions at the water table. Stage II weathering (pedogenesis) is
   marked by a significant decrease in bulk density and increase in
   porosity as shale disaggregates to soil. Rainfall dissolves calcite and
   thenardite (Na2SO4) at the surface, infiltrates to about 1 m, and
   precipitates gypsum during evaporation. Gypsum formation (estimated 390
   kg m(-2)) enriches soil moisture in Na and residual SO4. Transpiration
   of this moisture to the surface or exposure of subsurface soil
   (slumping) produces more thenardite. Most Se remains in the soil as
   selenite adsorbed to ferric oxides, however, some oxidizes to selenate
   and, during wetter conditions is transported with soil moisture to
   depths below 3 m. Coupled with little rainfall, relatively insoluble
   gypsum, and the translocation of soluble Se downward, MS landscapes will
   be a significant nonpoint source of salinity and Se to the Colorado
   River well into the future. Other trace elements weathering from MS that
   are often of environmental concern include U and Mo, which mimic Se in
   their behavior; As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb, which show little
   redistribution; and Cd, Sb, V, and Zn, which accumulate in Stage I
   shale, but are lost to varying degrees from upper soil intervals. None
   of these trace elements have been reported previously as contaminants in
   the study area. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, the degradation of nutrient-poor Ferralsols limits
   productivity and drives agricultural expansion into pristine areas.
   However, returning agricultural residues to the soil in a stabilized
   form may offer opportunities for maintaining or improving soil quality,
   even under conditions that typically promote carbon loss. We examined
   the use of biochar made from filtercake (a byproduct of sugarcane
   processing) on the physicochemical properties of a cultivated tropical
   soil. Filtercake was pyrolyzed at 575 degrees C for 3 h yielding a
   biochar with increased surface area and porosity compared to the raw
   filtercake. Filtercake biochar was primarily composed of aromatic
   carbon, with some residual cellulose and hemicellulose. In a three-week
   laboratory incubation, CO2 effluxes from a highly weathered Ferralsol
   soil amended with 5\% biochar (dry weight, d.w.) were roughly four-fold
   higher than the soil-only control, but 23-fold lower than CO2 effluxes
   from soil amended with 5\% (d.w.) raw filtercake. We also applied
   vinasse, a carbon-rich liquid waste from bioethanol production typically
   utilized as a fertilizer on sugarcane soils, to filtercake- and
   biochar-amended soils. Total CO2 efflux from the biochar-amended soil in
   response to vinasse application was only 5\% of the efflux when vinasse
   was applied to soil amended with raw filtercake. Furthermore, mixtures
   of 5 or 10\% biochar (d.w.) in this highly weathered tropical soil
   significantly increased water retention within the plant-available range
   and also improved nutrient availability. Accordingly, application of
   sugarcane filtercake as biochar, with or without vinasse application,
   may better satisfy soil management objectives than filtercake applied to
   soils in its raw form, and may help to build soil carbon stocks in
   sugarcane-cultivating regions.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon (C) is crucial for maintaining soil functions, and it
   increases after conversion of an agricultural field from conventional
   tillage management to no-tillage management due to decreasing
   human-induced soil disturbance and the modification of soil structure
   through ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. To improve soils and
   prevent degradation, understanding the effects of no-tillage management
   over time in changing water stable aggregates (WSA) and soil C is
   important. We investigated the changes in WSA and soil C at a site in
   Akame, Mie, Japan, operating a no-tillage with weed mulch management
   (NWM) system over a chronosequence from 0 to 17 years after conversion
   from conventional tillage practices (NWM for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 17
   years). We measured weed aboveground biomass, litter accumulation, and
   root and earthworm density and biomass, and analyzed the WSA and C of
   bulk soil and each WSA size fraction. Weed aboveground biomass increased
   with site age, while litter accumulation, root biomass (soil depth of
   0-4 cm), and earthworm density and biomass did not appear to be related
   to site age. Endogeic earthworm density and biomass tended to increase
   at year 5 of NWM compared to year 0. The WSA >2 mm and soil C stock in
   WSA of >2 mm increased over time under NWM at a soil depth of 0-15 cm,
   while the soil C stock of 0.25-1-mm WSA decreased at soil depths of 0-5
   cm. The total soil C accumulation rate was 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at a soil
   depth of 0-25 cm over the NWM chronosequence. Therefore, our results
   indicated that by adopting NWM, C inputs to the soil from weed
   aboveground biomass, as well as increases in the WSA of >2 mm, might be
   responsible for soil C sequestration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils is a major source of pollution
   for adjacent water systems. Biochar application to agricultural soils
   was reported to manageably reduce N leaching. For the sustainable use of
   biochar application, a mechanistic understanding of the changes in N
   leaching induced by biochar treatment is urgently needed. In this study,
   the effects of biochar {[}rice (Oryza sativa L.) chaff] application to
   rice paddy soil (sandy loam) on leaching and soil structure were
   investigated. Free-draining lysimeters (0.2 m in diameter by 0.1 m in
   height) filled with 500 g of air-dried soil were treated with biochar at
   0, 2, and 10\% application rates (BC0, BC2, and BC10, respectively) and
   N fertilizer (NH4Cl) at 0 and 100 kg ha(-1) application rates (Fert0 and
   Fert100, respectively). During the 9-wk incubation, the concentration of
   dissolved C in the leachates was higher in the soils treated with BC2
   and BC10 compared with that treated with BC0 in the Fert0 soil while
   there were no significant differences among the biochar treatments in
   the Fert100 soil. This result indicated that the labile portion of the
   applied biochar C was utilized by microbes as the amended N was
   metabolized. Nitrate contents in leachates from the BC2 and BC10
   treatments were significantly smaller than in those from the BC0 soil.
   Soil analysis showed that NH4+ content decreased and NO3- content
   increased under BC10 treatment compared with BC0 treatment in the
   Fert100 soil, indicating that net N mineralization in the soil was
   enhanced under biochar treatment. We suggested that the NO3- retention
   in the biochar-treated soil was related to increased soil aggregation.
   The C contents in the wet stable aggregates of size 53 to 1000 mm were
   significantly increased by biochar addition. This size fraction of
   aggregates is related to soil mesopores, which are involved in the
   soil's water holding. The water holding capacity (WHC) was higher in the
   BC2 and BC10 soils than in the BC0 soil, suggesting that application of
   rice chaff biochar to rice paddy soil could reduce N leaching through
   the redistribution of soil pores by forming more wet stable aggregates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{31-39}},

Abstract = {{Biochar samples were produced from rubber wood sawdust (RWSD), which is
   a by-product from sawmills, via slow pyrolysis. Biochar is a potential
   additive for agricultural soil as a soil amendment and for agronomics.
   The approach proposed in the current study considers the effects of
   heating temperature and holding time on the surface functional groups
   and morphologies of RWSD-derived biochars. The pyrolysis was performed
   in a vertical tube furnace heated at 5 degrees C/min from room
   temperature to maximum heating temperatures of 300 degrees C, 400
   degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C under nitrogen gas purging at
   a rate of 30 ml/min. Two sets of biochars were produced with holding
   times of (i) 1 h and (ii) 3 h. Proximate and ultimate analyses were
   performed on the raw RWSD using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
   carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis. The influence of
   heating temperature and holding time on biochar surface functional
   groups and porosities was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Boehm titration, pH
   alkalinity, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM with energy-dispersive Xray (SEM-EDX)
   spectrocopy. The FT-IR spectra indicated the presence of acidic
   functional groups, such as carboxylic, phenolic and lactonic groups, and
   these groups were quantified by Boehm titration. The number of acidic
   functional groups decreased as the heating temperature and holding time
   increased. The maximum amount of acidic functional groups was determined
   to be 1.9 mmol/g at 300 degrees C for a 1-h holding time compared to 1.3
   mmol/g for a 3-h holding time and 1.0 mmol/g with a 1-h holding time at
   700 degrees C. All of the biochars produced at heating temperatures
   above 400 degrees C were alkaline, and the pH value increased as the
   heating temperature and holding time increased. The biochar produced at
   300 degrees C with a 1-h holding time had a pH of 6.72 and the sample
   produced with a 3-h holding time had a pH of 7.67. In addition, the
   sample produced when the temperature was increased to 700 degrees C with
   a 1-h holding time had a pH of 11.44. The BET surface area analysis
   reported maximum values of 5.49 m(2)/g, and the total pore volume was
   0.0097 cm(3)/g at a heating temperature of 700 degrees C with a 3-h
   holding time. SEM micrographs clearly showed the development of
   well-defined pores in the biochars, and the SEM-EDX spectra indicated
   localised carbon and oxygen content in all the samples. The results
   indicated that biochars produced from RWSD are potentially beneficial as
   soil amendments. However, an extensive study of biochar sustainability
   is worth investigating. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   along a landscape heterogeneity gradient}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Soil functions can be classified as supporting (nutrient cycling) and
   provisioning (crop production) ecosystem services (ES). These services
   consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed
   using indicators, e.g. microbial biomass as an indicator of supporting
   services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of
   soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has
   been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance
   soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil
   services - organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and
   available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net
   nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and
   retention) - in barley fields, leys and permanent pastures along a
   landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000 m radii). In
   addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against
   these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of
   most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were
   consistently lower than in permanent pastures. Leys supported greater
   microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no
   effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However,
   landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH,
   suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and
   therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing
   barley yield and the soil indicators. The results suggest that soil ES
   are determined at the field level, with little influence from the
   surrounding landscape, and that greater crop yields do not necessarily
   come at the expense of supporting soil services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Long term erosion processes affect soil significantly, especially on
   vineyards that represent one of the most erosion prone types of
   cultivated lands. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of
   erosion processes on soil properties in the vineyards of Vrable
   viticultural district in Slovakia. The spatial and profile changes of
   selected soil properties have been measured along the slope transects on
   summit, backslope and footslope position. Transects were located on same
   slope under two different types of soil cultivation: ploughing and
   hoeing. The erosion and deposition rates were estimated using the
   levelling method based on successive measurement of the soil surface
   variability against vineyard. We found a significant difference between
   erosion and deposition rates on different part of the slope as well as
   in use of different management practices. Some selected soil properties
   (pH, organic carbon content - Cox, bulk density -BD, porosity - POR,
   erodibility - K, Cu content) were compared both for the severe eroded
   ploughed and the slightly eroded hoed vineyard in summit, footslope and
   backslope. In case of hoed vineyard the parameters reached values of:
   Summit - Ph = 7.54; Cox= 1.30 \%; BD = 1.38 g.cm(3); POR = 48.10 \%; K =

   = 144 mg.kg(-1).The higher variability of soil properties and more
   intensive transformation of soil profile related to more accelerated
   erosion processes on ploughed vineyard have been noticed. Values of pH,
   organic carbon content and Cu content were considerable lower in the
   eroded part of the ploughed vineyard if compared with the slightly

   experiment results showed that a portion of the total soil water was
   available for transport processes while the remaining of the soil water
   was considered immobile and not readily accessible for solutes. The
   separation in water fractions of different mobilities was surprisingly
   consistent among OMW treatments. The bromide recovery rate decreased
   with the application of OMW showing that tracer molecules became trapped
   within immobile water phases. The application of OMW increased
   significantly the soil water-holding capacity, whereas the soil
   hydraulic conductivity in the near saturation range decreased
   significantly with long-term OMW application. The soil irrigated with
   OMW had significantly higher organic matter content, lower bulk density
   and relatively higher total porosity, but lower macroporosity than that
   of control sites. We concluded that the soil was increasingly coated

   This article presents crop productivity and P dynamics studies during
   the second crop cycle of okra-pea sequence (2010-2011) and statuses of
   different P fractions in the soil after the second pea crop harvest
   during 2010-2011. Crop productivity and P uptake data in okra-pea
   sequence indicated that application of VAM + 75\% P dose at either of
   two irrigation regimes did not differ significantly than GRD treatment
   and VAM + 100\% P dose. It suggests an economy of about 25\% inorganic P
   dose through VAM fungi. The treatments imbedded with VAM inoculation
   enhanced the P uptake in okra-pea system, on an average by 21\% over the
   GRD and non-VAM-inoculated counterparts. Further, integrated application
   of P, VAM, and irrigation regimes evaluated in okra-pea sequence for 2
   years led to greater status of water-soluble P (21\%), sodium
   bicarbonate (NaHCO3)-inorganic phosphorus (Pi) (11\%), sodium hydroxide
   (NaOH)-Pi (9\%), hydrochloric acid (HCl)-extractable-P (20\%) over
   non-VAM-inoculated counterparts and low status of organic P (NaHCO3-P-o
   and NaOH-P-o), all of which appreciably contributed to available P
   supply to plants in the present study in an acid Alfisol. The
   correlation coefficient reveals that contribution of inorganic P forms
   is highly correlated to crop productivity and total P uptake in okra and
   pea crops besides soil available P in the present study. Overall, it is
   concluded that VAM inoculation in okra-pea cropping system significantly
   enhanced the P availability to plants by way of enriching the labile-P
   pool such as water-soluble P and P loosely bound to aluminium (Al-P) and
   iron (Fe-P) on adsorption complexes and by P mineralization from organic
   matter in an Himalayan acid Alfisol.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the future, agriculture will need to produce more, from less land,
   more sustainably. But currently, in many places, actual crop yields are
   below those attainable. We quantified the ability for agricultural
   management to increase wheat yields across 179 Mha of potentially arable
   land in Australia. Using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator
   (APSIM), we simulated the impact on wheat yield of 225 fertilization and
   residue management scenarios at a high spatial, temporal, and agronomic
   resolution from 1900 to 2010. The influence of management and
   environmental variables on wheat yield was then assessed using
   Spearman's non-parametric correlation test with bootstrapping. While
   residue management showed little correlation, fertilization strongly
   increased wheat yield up to around 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). However, this
   effect was highly dependent on the key environment variables of
   rainfall, temperature, and soil water holding capacity. The influence of
   fertilization on yield was stronger in cooler, wetter climates, and in
   soils with greater water holding capacity. We conclude that the
   effectiveness of management intensification to increase wheat yield is
   highly dependent upon local climate and soil conditions. We provide
   context-specific information on the yield benefits of fertilization to
   support adaptive agronomic decision-making and contribute to the closure
   of yield gaps. We also suggest that future assessments consider the
   economic and environmental sustainability of management intensification
   for closing yield gaps.}},

Title = {{Effects of ecological and conventional agricultural intensification
   practices on maize yields in sub-Saharan Africa under potential climate
   change}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Much of Africa is among the world's regions with lowest yields in staple
   food crops, and climate change is expected to make it more difficult to
   catch up in crop production in particular in the long run. Various
   agronomic measures have been proposed for lifting agricultural
   production in Africa and to adapt it to climate change. Here, we present
   a projection of potential climate change impacts on maize yields under
   different intensification options in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using an
   agronomic model, GIS-based EPIC (GEPIC). Fallow and nutrient management
   options taken into account are (a) conventional intensification with
   high mineral N supply and a bare fallow, (b) moderate mineral N supply
   and cowpea rotation, and (c) moderate mineral N supply and rotation with
   a fast growing N fixing tree Sesbania sesban. The simulations suggest
   that until the 2040s rotation with Sesbania will lead to an increase in
   yields due to increasing N supply besides improving water infiltration
   and soils' water holding capacity. Intensive cultivation with a bare
   fallow or an herbaceous crop like cowpea in the rotation is predicted to
   result in lower yields and increased soil erosion during the same time
   span. However, yields are projected to decrease in all management
   scenarios towards the end of the century, should temperature increase
   beyond critical thresholds. The results suggest that the effect of
   eco-intensification as a sole means of adapting agriculture to climate
   change is limited in Sub-Saharan Africa. Highly adverse temperatures
   would rather have to be faced by improved heat tolerant cultivars, while
   strongly adverse decreases in precipitation would have to be faced by
   expanding irrigation where feasible. While the evaluation of changes in
   agro-environmental variables like soil organic carbon, erosion, and soil
   humidity hints that these are major factors influencing climate change
   resilience of the field crop, no direct relationship between these
   factors, crop yields, and changes in climate variables could be
   identified. This will need further detailed studies at the field and
   regional scale.}},

   soil exchange complex and dry sieved macroaggregates clusters.
   Exponential semivariogram model described the structure of soil organic

Abstract = {{Soil sodicity and salinization are two major issues concerning

   i.e. no-tillage with subsoiling and straw cover (NTSC) and conventional
   tillage with ploughing and straw removal (CTSR), on soil physical and
   chemical properties and yields were compared from 1999 to 2011. The
   results showed that NTSC reduced soil bulk density in the 0-30 cm soil
   layer, but more importantly the treatment increased total porosity by
   20.9\%, water stable aggregates and pore size class distribution. The
   enhance soil structure and improved infiltration in NTSC treatments
   contributed to reducing soil salinity by 20.3\%-73.4\% when compared
   with CTSR. Soil organic matter was significantly greater to 30 cm in
   NTSC, while total soil nitrogen was lower than CTSR treatments; however,
   available P was significantly higher in the 0-5 cm soil surface. During
   the first 3 years, there was no difference in spring maize yield between
   NTSC and CTSR, but yield significantly increased in NTSC compared with
   CTSR during the remaining years due to reduced salinity stress and

Abstract = {{The adoption of no-till in the humid subtropical region of Brazil based

Abstract = {{Dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) is a soil fumigant used in agricultural
   systems as an alternative to methyl bromide (MeBr) for the control of
   soilborne pests and pathogens. However, fumigants including DMDS that
   have broad biocidal activity can affect both target and non-target
   organisms in soil. This study focused on the effects of DMDS on the
   recovery of ecologically important microbial communities and soil
   abiotic factors while affecting plant parasitic nematodes in both field
   and microplot trials. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used
   to characterize changes in microbial community structure over time.
   Total amount of PLFA as well as all major non-target soil microbial
   groups such as Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, fungi,
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and actinomycetes decreased
   significantly 15 d after fumigation in the untreated control as well as
   in all the rates of DMDS tested in a microplot trial. Fumigation had
   little effect on microbial biomass but at some time points some
   treatments did affect microbial community structure. Canonical
   multivariate analysis of variance indicated that soil microbial
   communities 45, 60, and 90 d after fumigation were similar to one
   another compared with 15 d after fumigation. The research showed that
   reduction and changes in microbial community biomass and structure were
   mainly due to environmental factors and therefore, it is concluded that
   DMDS fumigation did not impact the activity of beneficial
   microorganisms. Total N, C, and other abiotic factors were also not
   affected by DMDS fumigation. Plant parasitic nematodes were greatly
   affected by DMDS fumigation and this interaction could be related to its
   mode of action which affects nematode mitochondrial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Rice-paddies are regarded as one of the main agricultural sources of N2O
   and NO emissions. To date, however, specific N2O and NO production
   pathways are poorly understood in paddy soils. N-15-tracing experiments
   were carried out to investigate the processes responsible for N2O and NO
   production in two paddy soils with substantially different soil
   properties. Laboratory incubation experiments were carried out under
   aerobic conditions at moisture contents corresponding to 60\% of water
   holding capacity. The relative importance of nitrification and
   denitrification to the flux of N2O was quantified by periodically
   measuring and comparing the enrichments of the N2O, NH4+-N and NO3--N
   pools. The results showed that both N2O and NO emission rates in an
   alkaline paddy soil with clayey texture were substantially higher than
   those in a neutral paddy soil with silty loamy texture. In accordance
   with most published results, the ammonium N pool was the main source of
   N2O emission across the soil profiles of the two paddy soils, being
   responsible for 59.7\% to 97.7\% of total N2O emissions. The NO3--N pool
   of N2O emission was relatively less important under the given aerobic
   conditions. The rates of N2O emission from nitrification (N2On) among
   different soil layers were significantly different, which could be
   attributed to both the differences in gross N nitrification rates and to
   the ratios of nitrified N emitted as N2O among soil layers. Furthermore,
   NO fluxes were positively correlated with the changes in gross
   nitrification rates and the ratios of NO/N2O in the two paddy soils were
   always greater than one (from 1.26 to 6.47). We therefore deduce that,
   similar to N2O, nitrification was also the dominant source of NO in the
   tested paddy soils at water contents below 60\% water holding capacity.}},

   intention of their effective utilization, hydrolysis residues from
   forestry (pinewood), energy crop system (timothy grass), and agriculture
   (wheat straw) were pyrolysed in a fixed-bed reactor at 600 A degrees C
   with slow heating rate of 5 A degrees C/min for 4 h. In order to
   understand the product (biochar, bio-oil, and gases) properties and
   advocate their energy and environmental values, chemical
   characterizations such as carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur analysis,
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, pH, electrical
   conductivity, scanning electron microscopy, porosity analysis,
   thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed. The
   yield of biochar, bio-oil and gases was 38.9-41.7, 18.6-22.3, and
   24.9-28.8 wt\%, respectively. The high pH and electrical conductivity of
   biochars with substantial amounts of Na, Mg, K, and Ca indicated their
   alkaline and saline nature, which would necessitate proper agronomical
   soil applications. Variable intensities of C-C, C-H, C-O, O-H, and C-N
   functional groups were detected in the FTIR spectra of residues,
   biochars, and bio-oils. Raman spectroscopy showed the development of
   graphite (1,580-1,610 cm(-1)) and defect (1,325-1,380 cm(-1)) carbon
   structures in biochars. H-1 NMR of bio-oils indicated aromatics,
   olefinics, and aliphatics, whereas C-13 NMR indicated carbonyls,
   aromatics, carbohydrates, alkyls, methoxy, and hydroxy carbon. GC
   studies of pyrolysis gases identified chiefly H-2 and CO with traces of
   CH4, CO2, and C-2+ components.}},

Abstract = {{This on-site study is a comparison between integrated rice cum prawn and
   rice cum fish cultures and their efficiencies in North-Eastern
   Bangladesh. Common rice cultivation practices in this area often cause
   environmental problems due to inadequate use of chemical fertilizers and
   addition of animal feed with fishmeal. Problems include eutrophication
   and the reduction of soil fertility, as well as the reduction of organic
   matter content, water holding capacity and the inefficient use of N due
   to leaching, run-off and denitrification. We evaluated major N inputs of
   additional feed and chemical N fertilizer into the rice paddy over three
   field seasons. The N content of rice grain did not increase
   significantly with fertilizer supply ranging from 41.18 +/- 5.57 kg/ha
   to 57.07 +/- 3.62 kg/ha. However, the supply of fertilizer significantly
   increased the N content of rice straw, consisting of stem, leaf and
   leaf, ranging from 27.69 +/- 6.80 kg/ha to 64.78 +/- 2.21 kg/ha. In
   addition, the supply of feed let to a significant increase of crude
   lipid per hectare of all integrated animal species, but not of crude
   protein. These results question the efficiency and economic viability of
   using chemical fertilizers and feed in integrated cultures. Compared to
   rice cum fish cultures, unfed and unfertilized rice cum prawn cultures
   achieved economically satisfying results in terms of the N-output of the
   major compounds and the N balance (Delta N). Our findings suggest that
   rice cum prawn cultures without chemical fertilization and without
   additional feed are economically possible and thus highly recommendable
   for small scale farmers as they reduce negative environmental impacts.
   This study can therefore guide future agricultural and aquacultural
   management practices to help improve fertilization techniques and feed
   supply. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during the year 2009-11 at ICAR
   Research Complex for North Eastern Hill Region (NEHR), Meghalaya to
   study the influence of land configuration and conservation tillage on
   soil health in a groundnut-toria cropping system. The experiment
   consisted of seven treatments {[}i. flat bed farmer's practice (FP) no
   residue; ii. broad beds and furrows (BBF) with residue incorporation;
   iii. BBF with residue + hedge leaves (Tephrosia sp) incorporation; iv.
   BBF with residue + hedge leaves (no tillage, NT); v. raised bed (RB)
   with residue incorporation; vi. RB with residue + hedge leaves
   incorporation; vii. RB with residue + hedge leaves (NT)] laid out in
   randomised block design and replicated thrice. The conservation
   treatments were found to significantly improve biological activity and
   chemical properties of soil. However, physical properties such as
   texture and bulk density were not significantly affected by any of the
   treatments. Infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity were 108\% and
   46\% higher, respectively, in the treatments under RB with residue +
   hedge leaves (NT) as compared to FP. Soil microbial biomass carbon was
   67\% higher under RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation than FP
   after the harvest of both the crops in the second year while
   dehydrogenase activity was 135\% higher in RB with residue + hedge
   leaves (NT) after the harvest of groundnut and RB with residue
   incorporation after the harvest of toria than FP, respectively. System
   productivity under RBs were significantly higher than that recorded
   under BBF and FB. Conservation treatments showed better soil health at
   the end of the cropping cycles and it is concluded that raised beds
   along with residue management can provide an alternative and sustainable
   technology contributing to sustainable agriculture in the NEHR of India
   which can be extrapolated to other similar areas..}},

Abstract = {{Soil fertility decline caused by deforestation, soil degradation and low

   properties and soil quality to land-use change was investigated along a
   chronosequence of farm fields on a Ferric Lixisol in the Ashanti region
   of Ghana. Soil bulk density increased significantly only in the top 0-10
   cm soil layer. Concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC)
   and total N decreased significantly in the top 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil
   depths. By 30 years after forest conversion, cocoa system had
   re-accumulated up to 38.8 Mg C ha(-1) or 85 \% of initial forest carbon
   stock values. Total porosity (\%) decreased significantly in
   shaded-cocoa fields in comparison with the natural semi-deciduous

   (DIs) revealed that total soil quality (0-20 cm) deteriorated
   significantly (DI = -60.6) in 3-year-old of cocoa system but improved in
   15 and 30-year-old systems. Available P stocks declined consistently
   while soil exchangeable Ca, K and Mg stocks as well as cation exchange
   capacity (CEC) and base saturation remained more or less stable with a
   tendency to improve. The inclusion of leguminous shade trees during
   early plantation development, development of mechanisms for the

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the nitrogen (N) cycle in agricultural soils
   is crucial for developing sustainable and environmentally friendly N
   fertilizer management and to propose effective nitrous oxide (N2O)
   mitigation strategies. This laboratory study quantified gross nitrogen
   transformation rates in uncultivated and cultivated black soils in
   Northeast China. It also elucidated the contribution made by
   nitrification and denitrification to the emissions of N2O. In the
   laboratory, soil samples adjusted to 60 \% water holding capacity (WHC)
   were spiked with (NH4NO3)-N-15 and NH4 (NO3)-N-15 and incubated at 25 A
   degrees C for 7 days. The size and N-15 enrichment of the mineral N
   pools and the N2O emission rates were determined between 0 and 7 days.
   The results showed that the average N2O emission rate was 21.6 ng N2O-N
   kg(-1) h(-1) in cultivated soil, significantly higher than in the
   uncultivated soil (11.6 ng N2O-N kg(-1) h(-1)). Denitrification was
   found to be responsible for 32.1 \% of the N2O emission in uncultivated
   soil, and the ratio increased significantly to 43.2 \% in cultivated
   soil, due to the decrease in soil pH. Most of the increase in net N2O-N
   emissions observed in the cultivated soil was resulting from the
   increased production of N2O through denitrification. Gross nitrification
   rate was significantly higher in the cultivated soil than in the
   uncultivated soil, and the ratio of gross nitrification rate/ammonium
   immobilization rate was 6.87 in cultivated soil, much larger than the
   uncultivated soil, indicating that nitrification was the dominant NH4
   (+) consuming process in cultivated soil, and this will lead to the
   increased production of nitrate, whereas the increased contribution of
   denitrification to N2O emission promoted the larger emission of N2O.
   This double impact explains why the risk of N loss to the environment is
   increased by long-term cultivation and fertilization of native prairie
   sites, and controlling nitrification maybe effective to abate the
   negative environmental effects.}},

Abstract = {{Labile pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) are affecting
   the carbon (C) and N fluxes in the terrestrial soils, whereas long-term
   C and N storage is determined by the long-lived recalcitrant fractions.
   Tillage and subsurface drainage influences these pools; however, the
   effect of these systems on poorly drained soils may be different.
   Therefore, the present study was conducted on a field experiment,
   established at the Waterman Farm of the Ohio State University in 1994.
   Specific objectives of the study are to assess the influence of
   no-tillage (NT), chisel tillage (CT) with drainage (TD) and non-drainage
   (ND) management under a continuous corn (Zea mays L.) system on SOC, C
   fractions (heavy and light), and water stable aggregates (WSA). Data
   from this study showed that the SOC stock for the NT was 25, 37 and 32\%
   higher for the 0-10, 10-20 and 40-60cm depths, respectively, as compared
   to that under CT system. Tillage significantly influenced the light
   fraction (LF) and heavy fraction (HF) of carbon. The NT system increased
   LF and HF by 10 and 12\%, respectively, compared to CT for the 0-10cm
   depth. Eighteen years of NT management decreased soil bulk density and
   improved macroaggregates and mean weight diameter compared to that under
   CT system. Drainage impacts on soil parameters were negligible, and may
   be partially due to the reason that the corn-corn cropping system may
   not have sufficiently improved the soil properties between the two
   tillage systems. In general, drainage improved porosity and the corn
   yield. It can be concluded that NT with subsurface management improves
   SOC dynamics and promotes aggregation and corn yield as compared to that
   with CT system.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are dynamic ecosystems that support a diversity of life.
   Therefore, the concept of soil quality or health, like that of human
   health, is not difficult to understand or recognize when the system is
   viewed as a whole. The challenge is to manage soils such that they are
   able to perform the various uses they are put to without degradation of
   the soils themselves or the environment. While, this is simple in
   concept, there are definite complexities that make the idea of soil
   health difficult to quantify. Which soil functions should be considered,
   which soil properties are most important to measure, and how to best
   measure those properties are some of the tough questions that need to be
   considered when attempting to quantify soil health. The great challenge
   is to manage soils in a sustainable fashion so that they will provide
   for human needs in the future. However, the measurement of soil
   processes and of the soil properties linked to these also depend on the
   use and location of the soil. When evaluating soil quality, it is
   therefore common to explore a range of soil physical, chemical, and
   biological properties. The single most important property determining
   the soil quality is the soil organic system because of the profound
   influence it has on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties.
   Therefore, many steps already taken to improve soil quality are dealing
   with improving soil organic matter status and hence, the vitality of the
   soil organic system. Some of the common ways to improve soil quality
   include: reduced tillage, use of green manure, application of animal
   manures, crop rotations, strip cropping, use of cover crops, application
   of sludge or biosolids, and other additions of organic materials and
   nutrients. These management techniques enhance the activity of both the
   micro-and macro-biological soil organic system, whose activities also
   improve properties such as soil aggregation, infiltration, and water
   holding capacity, decrease bulk density, penetration resistance and soil
   erosion, and increase cation exchange capacity. Management for soil
   quality can also lead to reduced need for agrochemicals and tillage,
   reduced fuel consumption by farm equipment, and increased sequestration
   of CO 2 in the soil, all of which benefit the environment. Modern
   agricultural science has the ability to correct many of the poor
   practices of the past and to maintain healthier soils that should
   sustain the uses they are put to.
   Therefore, this review will be focused on the integrated nutrient
   management to enhance plant nutrition, restore degraded soils, identify
   site-specific parameters as indicators of soil quality, and describe the
   impact of soil quality improvements on increasing agronomic production
   and advancing global food security. Integrated nutrient management and
   its effect on different soil quality indicators will be also addressed.}},

   different systems: conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT),
   no-tillage (NT) and chiseled no-tillage (CNT), taking into consideration
   the annual ryegrass cropped for different uses {[}cover crop (C),
   grazing (G) and silage (S)] during the winter. Soil bulk density (Db),
   total porosity (TP), macro (Ma) and microporosity (Mi), water retention
   curves (SWRC) and water retention due to pore size (r) were determined.
   The annual ryegrass used as C produced lower Db and Mi and higher TP and
   Ma in CT, MT and CNT systems. No difference was verified between G and S
   in any of the management systems or soil layers. The superficial layer
   SWRC presented similar behavior regarding CT, MT and CNT. Under NT, C
   resulted in higher water retention. However, G and S provided higher
   water retention due to the pore size in this system.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{533-542}},
Abstract = {{Some topsoil physical properties evolve unfavourably under continuous,
   no-till farming. On the Pampa, loam soils under no-till sometimes have
   lower infiltration rates than those conventionally tilled; this is due
   to the occurrence of platy and massive structures. In this study, we
   aimed to identify the soil management practices that promote platy
   structure formation, and explain the soil physical behaviour linked to
   the thickness of platy structures in relation to infiltration rate, bulk
   density and shear strength. Six fields with different numbers of years
   under agriculture and diverse previous crops (maize or wheat-soybean
   double crop) were sampled, distinguishing within each field headlands
   (areas with higher traffic) and centre (lower traffic). Twenty samples
   were taken at random along a 200-m transect to characterise soil
   structure (platy, granular or massive) and the thickness of the platy
   structure. Principal component analysis revealed linkages between
   previous crop and location in each field and type of structure. ANOVA
   showed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction of previous crop x location.
   The frequency and thickness of the platy structures were lower, and
   those of granular structures higher, under wheat-soybean double cropping
   and in the centre of the field. Greater thickness of the platy structure
   determined lower water infiltration rate (r = -0.337; P < 0.01) and
   greater soil shear strength (r = 0.297, P < 0.01). Micromorphological
   analysis indicated the dominance of massive and platy structure in the
   headlands and bioturbation in the centre of the fields with
   wheat-soybean double cropping. These results suggest bioturbation,
   crop-root binding and low machinery traffic as the main factors
   minimising soil evolution towards unfavourable structural types under
   no-till farming in the area.}},

Abstract = {{In agricultural systems, maintenance of soil organic matter has long
   been recognized as a strategy to reduce soil degradation. Manure
   amendments and green manures are management practices that can increase
   some nutrient contents and improve soil aggregation. We investigated the
   effects of 28 yr of winter planted green manure on soil aggregate-size
   distribution and aggregate-associated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The
   study was a randomized completed block design with three replicates. The
   treatments included rice-rice-fallow, rice-rice-rape, rice-rice-Chinese
   milk vetch and rice-rice-ryegrass. The experiment was established in
   1982 on a silty light clayey paddy soil derived from Quaternary red clay
   (classified as Fe-Accumuli-Stagnic Anthrosols) with continuous early and
   late rice. In 2009, soil samples were collected (0-15 cm depth) from the
   field treatment plots and separated into water-stable aggregates of
   different sizes (i.e., >5, 2-5, 1-2, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5 and <0.25 mm) by
   wet sieving. The long-term winter planted green manure significantly
   increased total C and N, and the formation of the 2-5-mm water-stable
   aggregate fraction. Compared with rice-rice-rape, rice-rice-Chinese milk
   vetch and rice-rice-ryegrass, the rice-rice-fallow significantly reduced
   2-5-mm water-stable aggregates, with a significant redistribution of
   aggregates into micro-aggregates. Long-term winter planted green manure
   obviously improved C/N ratio and macro-aggregate-associated C and N. The
   highest contribution to soil fertility was from macro-aggregates of 2-5
   mm in most cases.}},

   conventional management in the study region, FYM and mulch are used for
   the amendment of the new reclaimed tidal flat regularly, but little is
   known about their effects on soil physical properties functioning. A
   study was conducted on a typical coastal tidal flat saline land, which

Journal = {{SOIL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{180-192}},
Abstract = {{Carbonates interfere with soil aggregation in semi-arid calcareous
   soils, promoting the stability of macroaggregates and decelerating the
   decomposition of the organic matter within them. Our aim was to
   determine the process through which carbonates participate in
   aggregation. We hypothesised (i) a tendency to accumulate reactive clay
   minerals via Ca2+ bridging, and (ii) a precipitation of carbonates
   within aggregates due to dissolution/re-precipitation phenomena. The
   <250-mu m fractions of a Typic Calcixerept (CALC) and a decarbonated
   Calcic Haploxerept (DECALC) were incubated from the same agricultural
   field in semi-arid Spain with added maize straw during 28 days. A
   size-based fractionation was used to separate different aggregates in
   incubated and field-moist samples, and aggregates were analysed for
   organic C and maize-derived C, clay mineralogy by X-ray diffraction, and
   micromorphology in digital images of thin sections. Contrary to the
   first hypothesis, the two soils showed a similar tendency to accumulate
   smectite in aggregates, probably because the cation exchange capacity
   was saturated by Ca2+ in both CALC and DECALC. Macroaggregates showed a
   less porous structure in CALC than in DECALC due to the accumulation of
   calcite microcrystals, as formulated in the second hypothesis. We
   propose that low porosity of macroaggregates is mainly responsible for
   the slower turnover of organic matter observed in CALC than in DECALC.
   These results explain the greater concentration of organic C in
   microaggregates within macroaggregates in field-moist samples in CALC
   than in DECALC. The different porosity of macroaggregates may also
   result in differences in physical properties between CALC and DECALC.
   These observations suggest a different response of calcareous soils in
   terms of organic matter protection, resistance to erosion, and water
   storage compared with other soil types in semi-arid lands.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of cropping on the hydrology and fertility of Vertosols in
   the northern Darling Basin (average annual rainfall >550mm) has received
   much attention, together with the constraints placed on crop growth by
   naturally occurring subsoil salt stocks. These factors have not been
   quantified in the drier (450-550mm), marginal cropping areas to the
   west. With widespread adoption of zero tillage technology and the
   potential for large increases in the capture and storage of rainfall in
   good seasons, mobilisation of salt could be exacerbated should crop
   water use be constrained by salt toxicity and/or nutrient deficiency. We
   investigated the size of salt stocks, historic deep drainage, and
   nutrient depletion under continuous cropping in the Grey and Brown
   Vertosols of the Walgett and Coonamble districts of north-western NSW.
   Soils collected from seven paired sites (cropped v. control native
   vegetation) showed chloride concentrations >500mg/kg within 0-1.2m, high
   exchangeable sodium percentage (similar to 30\%) at depth and deficiency
   in phosphorus, manganese and zinc. Soil total nitrogen decreased from an
   average stock of 4.9t/ha at a rate of 0.008t/ha.year under cropping
   within 0-0.1m and soil carbon stocks decreased from 39t/ha by
   0.20t/ha.year within 0-0.5m.. Despite low rainfall, high evaporation and
   the large water-holding capacity of the cracking clays, there were
   significant downward shifts in chloride concentrations under cropping.
   Estimates of deep drainage under continuous cropping using chloride mass
   balance, chloride-front displacement and crop water-balance modelling
   with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) generally
   agreed (range 0.1-2\% of average annual rainfall). Simulations suggested
   that deep drainage may be increased 5-10-fold under zero-tillage winter
   cropping due to enhanced capture of rainfall by zero tillage compared
   with traditional practices. The associated flushing of salt from the
   root-zone together with correction of nutrient deficiency would enhance
   crop water use and productivity. Current methods indicate little storage
   in the subsoil for future deep drainage and that hydraulic conductivity
   is very low. Hence, the long-term effects of any increase in drainage
   rates, due to changes in cropping practices and/or climate, on the
   potential for salinisation of groundwater or transient water logging of
   the surface, are equivocal.}},

   significantly lower bulk density (5\%) than non-manured plots. Among
   cropping systems highest values were found in SW, MW and SW compared to
   RW, with higher values in the former systems for WSA (243\%), AWC (16\%)
   and macro-porosity (39\%). This clearly gave indication of the
   deteriorative effect of puddling in rice cultivation. Higher values were
   observed in MW, RW, CW with higher OM (36\%), active carbon (ActC,
   33.6\%) and PMN (731\%) compared to CW and VV. Only S and Mg were
   significantly higher in manured plots while pH, CEC, NO3-N, P, K, Zn and
   Ca were statistically not different in manured fields. Results of this
   study conclude that long-term manure applications improve soil quality,
   while puddling, especially in rice cultivation, exhibits maximum damage
   to soil physical quality indicators. (C) 2014 Friends Science Publishers}},

Abstract = {{Optimal use of management systems including tillage and winter cover
   crops is recommended to improve soil quality and sustain agricultural
   production. The effects on soil properties of three tillage systems (as
   main plot) including direct drilling (D), harrowing to a depth of 8 to
   10 cm (H), and moldboard plowing (MP) with and without a cover crop were
   evaluated in a long-term experiment on a sandy loam soil in Denmark.
   Chemical, physical, and biological soil properties were measured in the
   spring of 2012. The field measurements included mean weight diameter
   (MWD) after the drop-shatter test, penetration resistance, and visual
   evaluation of soil structure (VESS). In the laboratory, aggregate
   strength, water-stable aggregates (WSA), and clay dispersibility were
   measured. The analyzed chemical and biological properties included soil
   organic C (SOC), total N, microbial biomass C, labile P and K, and pH.
   Reduced tillage (D and H) resulted in a stratification of the chemical
   properties within the 0- to 20-cm topsoil layer but a uniform
   distribution for MP. There was an accumulation of SOC, total N, and
   labile P and K and reduced pH in the 0- to 10-cm layer. Reduced tillage
   increased soil strength in terms of greater MWD, VESS, WSA, aggregate
   tensile strength, and rupture energy. Five years of using a cover crop
   alleviated plow pan compaction at the 20- to 40-cm depth by reducing
   penetration resistance. A significant interaction between tillage and
   cover crop treatments indicated the potential benefit of using a
   combination of cover crops and direct drilling to produce a better soil
   friability. The usefulness of the VESS method for soil structural
   evaluation was supported by the high positive correlation of MWD with
   VESS scores.}},

   with inorganic and organic amendments}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{52-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Globally, fly ash (FA), generated in huge quantities from coal fired
   power plants is a problematic solid waste. Utilization of FA as an
   ameliorant for improving soil quality has received a great deal of
   attention over the past four decades, and many studies have been carried
   out worldwide. The silt-sized particles, low bulk density (BD), higher
   water holding capacity (WHC), favorable pH, and significant presence of
   plant nutrients in FA, make it a potential amendment for soils. The
   studies suggest enormous potential for the use of FA to improve
   cultivable, degraded/waste land, mine soil, landfills, and also to
   reclaim abandoned ash ponds, for agriculture and forestry. FA
   application improves the physical, chemical and biological qualities of
   soils to which it is applied. However, in some cases, depending on the
   characteristics of FA, the release of trace elements and soluble salts
   from FA to a soil-plant-human system could be a constraint. The effect
   is minimal in the case of weathered FA. The findings reflected the
   heterogeneity of ash characteristics, soil types, and agro-climatic
   conditions, thus a generalized conclusion on the impact of FA on plant
   species and soil quality is difficult. It is very important that the
   application of FA to soil must be very specific depending on the
   properties of the FA and soil. A considerable amount of research has
   been carried out to blend FA with varieties of organic and inorganic
   materials, like lime, gypsum, red mud, animal manure, poultry manure,
   sewage sludge, composts, press mud, vermicompost, biochar,
   bioinoculants, etc. Co-application of FA with these materials has much
   advantage: enhanced nutrient availability, decreased bioavailability of
   toxic metals, pH buffering, organic matter addition, microbial
   stimulation, overall improvement in the general health of the soil, etc.
   The performance of FA blending with organic and inorganic materials is
   better than FA alone treatments. Farm manure was found to be the most
   promising amendment used along with FA. While using FA in agriculture as
   a soil ameliorant, it is better to seek the locally available fitting
   blend materials for exploiting the benefits from their synergistic
   interaction. However, continuous research in parallel for long durations
   to dispel apprehension, if any, is desirable under well defined
   regulatory measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{911-924}},
Abstract = {{The use of biochar in agricultural soils appears to be promising because
   it is known to improve soil properties and increase crop production.
   However, few studies have been conducted with biochar on volcanic soils.
   Two field experiments were conducted simultaneously to evaluate the
   effect of oat hull biochar (OBC) on various physical-chemical properties
   of two volcanic soils, an `Inceptisol' and an `Ultisol', and to evaluate
   the resulting effects on the yields of barley (Hordeum vulgare) grown on
   these soils. The OBC doses applied to field microplots were equivalent
   to 0, 5, 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1). The results showed that pH, total
   exchangeable bases, and electrical conductivity increased at the highest
   dose of OBC in both soils. Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) was
   significantly high in the Ultisol at a rate of 20 Mg OBC ha(-1).
   Water-stable aggregates (WSA) and mean weight diameter (MWD) were
   enhanced at the highest doses of OBC in both soils. However,
   water-holding capacity (WHC) only increased in the Ultisol when amended
   with OBC at rates of 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1). Barley yield (grain weight
   m(-2)) significantly increased at the highest OBC dose by 31.3\% and
   21.9\% for crops grown on the Inceptisol and Ultisol, respectively.
   Significant relationships were observed between WHC and glomalin
   fractions (r = 0.81, p < 0.01 for easily extractable-GRSP and r = 0.62,
   p < 0.01 for Total-GRSP) as well as between organic C and WSA and both
   glomalin fractions. According to this study, biochar may be used
   effectively to improve the quality of these two volcanic soils and
   promote sustainable grain production.}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality indicators are measurable soil attributes that reveal the
   soil productivity response or soil-environment functionality that are
   used to know whether soil quality is improving, remain constant, or
   declining. These characteristics could be assessed by different indices
   such as sustainability index approach (SI) based on the threshold levels
   of soil indicators and cumulative rating approach (CR) based on crop
   production limitations, which show the sustainability of soil ecosystem
   in terms of soil degradation. Since Iran is situated in arid and
   semi-arid climatic conditions, this research was conducted in
   agriculture fields of southeast of Mashhad, Iran for comparing these two
   approaches. Sixty three soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected and nine
   soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic
   carbon (SOC), soil particle-size distribution, available water holding
   capacity (AWHC), bulk density (BD), air capacity (AC), relative field
   capacity (RFC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were measured. All
   these measurements were considered as total data set (TDS). Principal
   component analysis (PCA) was used to select more effective indicators to
   conform the minimum data set (MDS). There was a strong correlation
   between SI and CR (R-2=0.69, p <0.05). Only six soil indicators selected
   as MDS (pH, SOC, AWC, BD and SAR) were correlated (p<0.01) significantly
   with SI and CR. These SI and CR results showed more promising effects on
   soil sustainability. PCA was found a suitable method for selecting the
   more effective indicators having R-2=0.77 (p <0.05) (CR-MDS versus
   CR-TDS) comparable with R-2=0.80 (p <0.05) (CR-MDS versus SI) to use

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{944-955}},

Abstract = {{Post-agricultural ecosystems are increasingly prevalent in contemporary
   landscapes. Understanding the ecological impacts of agricultural
   legacies, which may last for decades to millennia following agricultural
   abandonment, is critical for interpreting contemporary patterns of
   biodiversity and for informing strategies for the restoration of
   post-agricultural ecosystems. However, the study of agricultural
   legacies is complicated by non-random land-use decisions: areas selected
   for agriculture commonly differ from non-agricultural areas in ways that
   may confound interpretation of agricultural legacies (e.g., agricultural
   areas may have more productive soils). We evaluated legacies of tillage
   agriculture in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands of the
   Southeastern United States, using a paired-plot study design (n = 29
   paired remnant and post-agricultural woodlands) to minimize the
   confounding influence of non-random past land-use decisions.
   Agricultural legacies were prevalent, but not due to differences in the
   types of sites selected for agriculture. Nearly 60 years after
   agricultural abandonment and afforestation, numerous soil attributes
   (i.e., N, P, organic matter, soil water holding capacity) remain altered
   in post-agricultural woodlands, relative to adjacent remnants. Overstory
   tree abundance and understory plant species richness were similar in
   remnant and post-agricultural woodlands, but we found a pronounced
   agricultural legacy on over- and understory plant community composition.
   Understory compositional differences were striking, particularly given
   the proximity of post-agricultural woodlands to immediately adjacent
   remnant source populations and the time (>50 years) for source
   populations to spread. This difference in understory community
   composition could be caused by the persistent environmental differences
   we observed or by dispersal limitation, as evidenced by greater species
   richness in post-agricultural sites with greater historical landscape
   connectivity. We suggest that future experimental work will further
   assist in a mechanistic understanding of how agricultural legacies
   impede understory plant recovery and that this understanding will
   benefit the formulation of strategies for the restoration of
   post-agricultural longleaf pine woodlands and other forested systems.

Abstract = {{The impact of land-use intensity is evaluated through changes in the

   landscape. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content, bulk density, aggregate
   stability and water-holding capacity (WHC) in the topsoil of active and
   abandoned vineyards, livestock routes (LR) and young Quercus afforested
   areas were analysed. These different types of land use can be
   interpreted as having a gradient of progressively less impact on soil
   functions or conservation. As soil use intensity declines, there is an
   increase in SOC content (from 0.2 to 0.6\%), WHC (from 0.2 to 0.3g H2O
   per g soil) and aggregate stability (from 4 to 33 drop impacts). Soils
   beneath vines have lost their upper horizon (15cm depth) because of
   centuries-old tillage management of vineyards. Except for an increase in
   bulk density (from 1.2 to 1.4g/cm(3)), there were no differences in soil
   characteristics 4yr after the abandonment of vine management. LR can be
   considered sustainable uses of land, which preserve or improve soil
   characteristics, as there were no significant differences between
   topsoil from LR and that from a 40-yr-old Quercus afforested area. SOC
   content, one of the main indicators for soil conservation, is considered
   very low in every case analysed, even in the more conservative uses of

   Transform (MVIT) techniques. Organic matter, water-stable aggregates,
   pH, cation exchange capacity, macroporosity, and water infiltration were
   reduced after burning in both sites. Active carbon and potentially
   mineralizable nitrogen increased after burning at Ibadan but decreased
   after burning at Akure. Soil quality decreased after burning by a range
   of 11.3-24.8\% using SMAF and MVIT, respectively, although only MVIT

Abstract = {{Regulatory initiatives in the United States have created the impetus to

   years 1990 through 2002 with flux rates based on four studies conducted
   during the period 2008 through 2010 in California, Michigan, Wisconsin,
   and Washington using current shank-injection/compaction methods. Up to a
   100-fold reduction in peak flux rates and total loss of MITC have been
   observed. A combination of the following factors led to these reductions
   in flux: soil moisture goals set at 70\% of the field water holding
   capacity; improved design of shank-injection systems to break up the
   voids after injection; effective shank compaction to further reduce
   volatilization; and the use of water sealing, where applicable. These
   refinements in the application methods for metam sodium provide a means
   to merge environmental and agricultural goals in the United States and
   in other countries that use metam sodium. This paper documents the

Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{78-93}},

Abstract = {{Conservation agricultural practices, such as no-tillage, crops rotation
   and balanced fertilization are increasingly adopted for maintaining soil
   fertility, improving crops health and reducing soil erosion.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the long-term
   adoption of contrasting tillage (no-tillage or conventional tillage) and
   N-fertilization (0 or 90 kg/ha N) practices on soil porosity and active
   bacterial communities in cropping system plots (sunflower wheat or maize
   wheat rotation) established on a clayish soil and under Mediterranean
   climate. Soil porosity was evaluated by micromorphological observations
   of soil thin sections. The composition and structure of the active
   bacterial communities were estimated by a culture-independent approach
   (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis, RT-PCR-DGGE) exploiting the 16S rRNA of bacteria and
   nirK, nirS and nosZ transcripts of denitrifiers. Finally, canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to correlate microbial data with
   soil physical and chemical characteristics.
   When repeated for a long period, no-tillage has significantly increased
   soil compaction compared to the conventional tilled soil. Soil
   compaction was likely responsible for creating a selective environment
   for active bacterial species. On the other hand, tillage favoured the
   richness and diversity of active soil bacteria by increasing the rate of
   diffusion of 02 and the energy sources availability. A wide variability

Abstract = {{The soil hydrophobicity can be understood as soil water repellency or
   difficulty in wetness. This phenomenon is associated with the covering
   soil particles and hydrophobic organic compounds reducing the soil
   sorptivity and hence infiltration of water. The objectives of this study
   were to determine the level of hydrophobicity in the soil and assess its
   relationship with resistance and size distribution of water stable
   aggregates, particle size distribution and organic matter content of
   different soils in southern Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were
   collected in different soil layers, 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm, to determine
   soil sorptivity, geometric mean diameter and aggregate stability index
   while granulometric composition and organic matter content were
   determined using disturbed soil samples. The sorptivity test was
   conducted using a tension micro-infiltrometer, with two different
   liquids, distilled water and ethanol (95\% v/v). The proportions of
   sand, silt and clay did not correlate significantly with the occurrence
   of hydrophobicity. In the hydrophobic soils, hydrophobicity index is
   directly associated with high organic matter contents and did not
   correlate with the particle size distribution. For the hydrophobic
   aggregates, cohesive forces between the particles acted for long period
   as a result of slow wetting, which led to an increase in geometric mean
   diameter, stability index of water stable aggregates and consequently
   greater resistance to the disintegrating actions of associated agents.

Abstract = {{Soil aggregate stability is an important ecosystem property which
   deteriorates overtime due to agricultural practices. The cessation of
   cultivation allows the potential recovery of soil aggregate binding
   agents such as soil micro-organisms and biochemical properties.
   Consequently, an increase in soil aggregate stability is expected.
   However, this outcome is difficult to predict because the response of
   each individual soil component and its contribution to soil stability
   varies.
   This study utilized a chronosequence of 12 ex-arable fields in the
   Bolivian Altiplano, representing six soil ages of abandonment after
   cessation of potato cultivation, to examine whether soil aggregate
   stability increases after abandonment and the extent to which changes in
   soil bacterial and fungal community composition and soil chemical
   properties are involved in stability recovery.
   Fields with the longest time since disturbance (15 and 20 years) have a
   greater proportion of water-stable aggregates than more recently
   abandoned fields (1 and 3 years) and exhibit larger differences in
   bacterial and fungal composition. Total N, NH4+, C and organic matter
   also increased with time since the last intensive agricultural practice.
   Water-stable aggregates were strongly correlated with soil fungal
   community composition. Analysis of covariance is also consistent with
   the soil fungal community being an important mediator of the recovery of
   aggregate stability.
   Synthesis and applications. Soil aggregate stability increased by 50\%
   over the 20 years following disturbance. This recovery was associated
   with shifts in soil fungal community composition, as is consistent with
   fungal mediation of this recovery. Land management strategies focusing
   on restoration of the soil fungal community may enhance soil aggregate
   stability, a key aspect for soil conservation, restoration,
   sustainability of agroecosystems and erosion prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems that utilize perennial or

   fractionated into four water stable aggregate-size classes:
   macroaggregate (>250 mu m), microaggregate (53-250 mu m), and silt +
   clay (<53 mu m), and three intra-aggregate size classes: particulate

Abstract = {{Biochar addition to agricultural soil is reported in several studies to
   reduce climate gas emissions, boost carbon storage, and improve soil
   fertility and crop productivity. These effects may be partly related to
   soil physical changes resulting from biochar amendment, but knowledge of
   how biochar application mechanistically affects soil physical
   characteristics is limited. This study investigated the effect of
   biochar application on soil structural and functional properties,
   including specific surface area, water retention, and gas transport
   parameters. Intact soil cores were taken from a field experiment on an
   arable sandy loam that included four reference plots without biochar and
   four plots with 20 tons ha(-1) biochar incorporated into the upper 20 cm
   7 months before sampling. Water retention was measured at matric
   potentials ranging from wet (pF 1.0) to extremely dry conditions (pF
   similar to 6.8), whereas gas transport parameters (air permeability,
   k(a), and gas diffusivity, D-p/D-o, where D-p is the gas diffusion
   coefficient in soil and D-o is the gas diffusion coefficient in free
   air) were measured between pF 2.0 and 3.0. Water retention under dry
   conditions and measured specific surface area were not significantly
   greater in the biochar-amended soil than the reference soil probably
   because of the relatively low biochar application rate. Yet, the
   biochar-amended soil showed a significant decrease in soil bulk density
   and an accompanying increase in total porosity. Water retention and
   air-filled porosity (epsilon) were both markedly greater in the
   biochar-amended soil than in the reference soil between pF 1.0 and 3.0.
   Soil macroporosity (equivalent to >0.1 mm pore diameter) and the ratio
   of macroporosity to total porosity were also significantly greater in
   the biochar-amended soil. As a result, the level of the pore
   organization (PO, k(a)/epsilon) was greater in the biochar-amended soil.
   Across the tested matric potentials, biochar amendment caused average
   increases of 28 to 34\% in epsilon, 53 to 161\% in D-p/D-o, and 69 to
   223\% in k(a), with the most significant increases occurring around
   natural field capacity (pF 2.0). Overall, the results suggest that
   biochar application even at a relatively low rate can alter soil
   functional characteristics, especially under normal field moisture
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Wind erosion is a soil degrading process that threatens agricultural
   sustainability and environmental quality globally. Protecting the soil
   surface with cover crops and plant residues, practices common in no-till
   and reduced tillage cropping systems, are highly effective methods for
   shielding the soil surface from the erosive forces of wind and have been
   credited with beneficial increases of chemical and physical soil
   properties including soil organic matter, water holding capacity, and
   wet aggregate stability. Recently, advances in biofuel technology have
   made crop residues valuable feed stocks for ethanol production.
   Relatively little is known about cropping systems effects on intrinsic
   soil erodibility, the ability of the soil without a protective cover to
   resist the erosive force of wind. We tested the bare, uniformly
   disturbed, surface of long-term tillage and crop rotation research plots
   containing silt loam soils in western Kansas and eastern Colorado with a
   portable field wind tunnel. Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) were
   measured using glass fiber filters and respirable dust, PM10 and PM2.5,
   were measured using optical particle counters sampling the flow to the
   filters. The results were highly variable and TSP emission rates varied
   from less than 0.5 mg m(-2) s(-1) to greater than 16.1 mg m(-2) s(-1)
   but all the results indicated that cropping system history had no effect
   on intrinsic erodibility or dust emissions from the soil surfaces. We
   conclude that prior best management practices will not protect the soil
   from the erosive forces of wind if the protective mantle of crop
   residues is removed. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Seed mill screenings would be a considerable biofeedstock source for

   shown. that char derived from the pyrolysis of a variety of biomass
   feedstocks has potential to enhance soil quality by pH adjustment,

   research was to characterize char produced from Kentucky bluegrass seed

   temperatures between 600 and 650 degrees C, with respect to polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons, selected heavy metals, as well as other physical

Abstract = {{The substitution of the native vegetation of marshlands in Paraiba,
   initially by sugarcane and more recently by pastures, in a strongly
   undulated relief, has caused serious problems of soil degradation.
   Currently, some of these pastures are being replaced by plantations of
   sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth). The objective was to analyze the
   effect of these changes on the soil physical and chemical properties and
   root development. The experiment was conducted in Areia-PB, in a
   dystrophic Ultisol. The three treatments were represented by three land
   uses: secondary native forest, sabia plantation, and brachiaria pasture
   grass (Brachiaria decumbens). Soil samples were collected from three
   slope positions: top, middle, and bottom. For physical properties and
   root studies, in each position soil was collected at three different
   points and in four depths (0.0-2.5, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-10.0, and 10.0-20.0
   cm). Composite samples were made to assess the chemical properties and
   clay content. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized
   design with repeated measures in space. The results showed better
   aggregation, density, and porosity in the area of native secondary
   forest. The replacement of pasture by sabia lead to a decrease in the
   aggregation but did not affect bulk density or soil's total porosity.
   Nutrient levels were higher in the sabia area, although statistically
   different just for K and saturation of exchangeable bases. Changes in
   land use invariably degrade soil physical and chemical properties, but
   when a less aggressive system is introduced, changes are hardly
   detectable in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Selected environments ranging from cultivated soils under vines and
   olive groves to sequential abandonment with forest, meadow and scrub
   cover were investigated for their impact on relevant physical and
   chemical properties in the shallow soils of the Cap de Creus Peninsula
   (NE Spain). Both insufficient agricultural practices and periodical
   wildfire occurrence in abandoned areas were focused as components
   triggering degradation processes. Despite that, less fire affected soils
   under Erica scrubs or meadows were found to be more active in carbon
   preservation potential. Soil properties like moisture, bulk density,
   water holding capacity, pH, organic carbon (SOC), carbon dioxide
   emission (CO2) and total nitrogen (TN) showed significant seasonal
   patterns within and between the investigated soil environments, but
   total phosphorus (TP) did not show a clear trending. Carbon loss (C-CO2)
   was extremely variable along the seasons in soil under vines, ranging
   from 3\% to 10\% of SOC stocks on annual basis. Assessment of C-CO2
   losses allowed establishing soils and associated management or stage of
   abandonment more susceptible to organic compound depletion. Glomalin and
   organic carbon were found to be significantly more active in favoring
   structural stability in the 2.00-5.60 mm aggregate class with respect to
   the 0.25-2.00 mm aggregate class, indicating that stable organic
   compounds may enhance the formation of larger aggregates and a better
   organized soil crumb. Seasonally, beta-glucosidase, protease and
   phosphatase activities were much lower in soils under vines in agreement
   with the lowest organic carbon content. Enzyme activity increased from
   soils under vines to soil under pasture and showed significant patterns
   within soil environments and between seasons. A three component factor
   structure showed component 1 to be positively and significantly related
   with variables favoring better soil conditions except the ratio
   C-CO2/SOC and the bulk density. Soils under pasture and Erica scrub were
   scored as being more relevant to the first component-variable
   association especially in winter, spring and autumn, as opposed to the
   soils under vines (V) at each season. In the summer season the
   structural stability of 0.25-2.00 mm aggregate class of all the soil
   environments but vines was loaded in the component 2 and resulted in
   opposition to CO2 emission and soil moisture only at soils under pasture
   and Cistus scrub, suggesting that CO2 emission increases at higher
   moisture content and both may cause disruption of smaller aggregates.
   Total phosphorus dynamics was found to depend by pH variation. The work
   showed the current trends of the soils under study underlying both
   susceptibility to degradation and potential for carbon storage and data
   should stimulate management plans for abandoned land aimed at recovering
   the landscape heterogeneity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different soil organic matter (SOM) managements on soil
   aggregate stability was evaluated in three agricultural sites in Italy.
   The field plots were treated with traditional deep tillage, minimum
   tillage, green manuring, mature compost, and iron-porphyrin as a
   biomimetic catalyst. Although the original soil texture exerted a strong
   influence on the overall soil physical quality, after 3 years of field
   experiments, the soil additions with humified compost, under maize
   cropping, improved both, the yield of water stable macroaggregates and
   the soil aggregate stability, with a pronounced effect on the aggregate
   distribution of the coarse textured soil. Soil treatments with the
   biomimetic catalyst, under wheat cropping, promoted an initial stable
   incorporation of finer particle-sizes in water-stable macro-aggregates.
   This effect was progressively lost with increasing experimental time due
   to either loss or inactivation of the catalyst. Innovative management
   practices for SOM stabilization based on soil amendment of either
   humified mature compost or a water-soluble catalyst to promote in-situ
   photopolymerization of humic molecules, were found to improve
   distribution and stability of soil water stable aggregates, as compared

Title = {{Impacts of irrigation with industrial treated wastewater on soil
   properties}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{31-39}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wastewater reuse in agriculture is a widespread practice in developing
   countries, especially in urban areas where water shortage and poverty
   encourage people to use that marginal resource. Raw or treated
   wastewaters are used by farmers, but even treated wastewaters frequently
   do not meet WHO and FAO standards for irrigation water. Such practices
   may lead to health hazards, relatively well documented in the literature
   and to environmental damages. Adverse environmental impacts such as soil
   degradation and groundwater contamination are frequently associated with
   the use of wastewater from industrial sources. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that wastewater irrigation may decrease soil hydraulic
   conductivity and infiltration rate. Nevertheless, the effects on soil
   structural and chemical behaviors have been little studied so far and
   need further investigations.
   The impacts of irrigation with alkaline and sodic industrial wastewater
   previously treated in microphyte ponds on soil physical and chemical
   properties were studied downstream the sewage treatment plant of Kossodo
   in Ouagadougou, on plots cropped with eggplants. Plots irrigated with
   fresh water and non cropped, non irrigated plots were used as controls.
   Different soil properties were characterized: pore volumes determined by
   using shrinkage analysis, pH and electrical conductivity of water
   extracts, and major soluble and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, and
   Na). Organic matter characterization was performed by means of three
   dimensional fluorescence spectra analysis to determine its origin and
   evolution on irrigated soils.
   Plots irrigated with wastewater showed important structural damages,
   especially in the subsurface horizon where the soil pore network
   collapsed dramatically, resulting in a compact impermeable layer.
   Fluorescence spectra revealed that the organic matter contained in the
   wastewater was largely dissolved due to a sharp soil pH increase,
   resulting in black alkali formation at the surface: the soil became
   sodic, with an exchange complex dominated by sodium, whereas plots
   irrigated with fresh water kept properties comparable to that of non
   irrigated plots. Such a rapid soil sodication was seldom reported so
   far. The study emphasizes the need to carefully examine irrigation water
   quality and particularly calcite residual alkalinity and suggests that
   shrinkage analysis could be used to monitor the physical changes of soil
   properties upon sodication. Inadequate wastewater quality is likely to
   cause deep and irreversible damages to irrigated soils. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) can be used to estimate saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K-s) from soil properties such as texture and
   bulk density. We evaluated several published PTFs to determine which was
   the most reliable for predicting maximum soil infiltration rates for
   soils in Dane County, Wisconsin. The PTFs were evaluated with a local
   database of measured infiltration rates (using a 5000-cm(2)
   infiltrometer), land use, soil properties (texture, bulk density, and
   organic matter content), and topographic properties (elevation, slope,
   and aspect) at 42 locations. We used Bayesian updating to combine local
   and national data to develop Dane County K-s estimates for some soil
   textural classes, some of which were subdivided into two porosity
   classes. We developed a local PTF for predicting K-s and examined the
   potential for using nonsoil properties (land use and topography) as
   predictors of K-s. The local PTF used the mass fraction of sand and bulk
   density as predictors; adding nonsoil predictors did not improve its
   accuracy. Although the local PTF had a lower root mean squared error
   (RMSE) than the published PTFs, it should be evaluated with an
   independent dataset. Of the published PTFs evaluated, the most reliable
   K-s estimate compared to the local database was the one used for soils
   with strong structure in the precision agricultural-landscape modeling
   system (PALMS), a fine-scale landscape process model. The K-s estimates
   developed by Bayesian updating corresponded well with those used in
   PALMS for soils with strong structure.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic mulching is an important agricultural practices used to improve
   crop productivity. Field experiments were conducted to determine the
   effect of plastic mulch patterns and crop rotations on runoff, erosion
   and soil physical properties in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. The
   experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic
   mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation
   treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs.
   broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The wide-plastic-mulch treatment
   significantly (P < 0.05) reduced runoff and soil loss compared to the
   narrow-plastic-mulch treatment, due to the better developed micro-basins
   found on the raised beds that enhanced infiltration in
   wide-plastic-mulch systems. Our results also indicated that inclusion of
   a winter wheat crop in the vegetable rotation did not alter the extent
   of runoff and soil loss from the vegetable field. Furthermore, we found
   that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil
   erosion in vegetable seedling stages. There were significant
   correlations between soil loss and runoff volume (P < 0.01) and rainfall
   intensity (P < 0.01). The losses of total C, N and P were closely
   associated with that of the soil loss, and 82\% of TC, 57\% of TN and
   75\% of TP is entrained with sediment. After growing season, furrows
   without plastic mulch displayed lower total porosity and macroporosity
   (>60 mu m) that impeded infiltration in surface soil (0-5 cm). Higher
   water stability of soil macro-aggregates >2 mm were observed in plastic

Abstract = {{Clearing and cultivation of indigenous woodlands for agriculture may be
   among the most important mechanisms of physical, chemical and biological
   land degradation in Zimbabwe, and southern Africa in general. The
   objective of the study was to determine the effects of clearing miombo
   woodland and converting the land to maize (Zea mays L.) cropping on
   selected soil properties on clay (Chromic luvisol) and loamy sand
   (Ferric acrisol) soils in central Zimbabwe. Soil samples were collected
   from undisturbed, cleared and cultivated woodlands after four cropping
   seasons and analyzed for soil organic C, total N and P. exchangeable
   bases, cation exchange capacity, infiltration rate, aggregate stability
   and microbial biomass C and N at 0-5, 6-10 and 11-20 cm depths. Results
   showed that clearing and conversion of miombo woodlands to croplands
   reduced soil nutrients, cation exchange capacity (range: 9.6-21.0
   cmol(c) kg(-1) in clay; 7.0-15.5 cmol(c) kg(-1) in loamy sand), and
   microbial C (range: 0.06-0.54\% in clay; 0.02-0.37\% in loamy sand). The
   extent and nature of change was variable, depending on the soil type and
   depth. Clearing of trees and leaving soil surface covered with grass did
   not always translate to a significant decline in soil organic C after
   four seasons (range: 0.69-2.24\% in clay; 0.24-1.43\% in loamy sand),
   unless the clearing was followed by successive cultivation and cropping
   without N fertilization. The reduced soil quality under cultivation was
   attributed to a potential pulse in decomposition and mineralization
   processes caused by soil disturbance, followed by leaching of released
   nutrients to lower horizons. This could be aided by nutrient removal in
   crop parts during harvest, without adequate soil nutrient replenishment.
   Under the woodland ecosystem, litter-fall may help to maintain
   steady-state infiltration rate (range: 45-126 cm h(-1) in clay; 32-97 cm
   h(-1) in loamy sand) by protecting the soil surface from damage and
   ensuring the formation of stable aggregates which preserve pore
   continuity. It was recommended that when miombo woodlands are to be
   cleared, management decisions that reduce tillage intensity and maximize
   residue retention should be put into practice; otherwise the clearing is
   strongly discouraged. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The arid agricultural lands of the Monegros Desert, in the central Ebro
   Basin (NE Spain), show contrasting white patches (WPs) and dark patches
   (DPs), evidencing their different soil composition. The white patches
   have shallow soils with low or nil crop development in most years. Soil
   at the dark patches uses to be deeper, and winter cereal attains better
   development. This paper analyzes soil hydro-physical features in order
   to identify differences in soil physical properties between white and
   dark soils. For this purpose, 20 pairs of WP/DP soils were studied on
   several agricultural plots. Each sampled pair was under the same soil
   condition. Three soil treatment (ST) were studied: freshly tilled soil
   (MB), cropped (C), and fallowed soil (F). The gypsum and calcium
   carbonate content, organic matter (OM) content, and particle size
   distribution for the 0-10 cm depth soil were determined. Field
   measurements for the 1-10 cm depth soil layer were soil bulk density
   (rho(b)), soil penetration resistance (SPR), saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K1-10) and sorptivity (S1-10). The water retention curve
   (WRC) was determined in the lab on undisturbed soil cores for the 1-10
   cm depth soil layer. Additional field measurements of soil surface crust
   sorptivity (S-crust) and hydraulic conductivity (K-crust) at saturation
   were also performed. The results show that WP soils have significantly
   (p < 0.05) higher contents of gypsum, lower contents of calcium
   carbonate and OM, and a coarser texture than DP soils. Compared to DP,
   the WP soils have higher values of SPR but lower rho(b), K and S values
   in both the surface crust and the 0-10 cm depth soil layer. On average,
   K1-10 in DP was 1.4 times higher than that measured in WP. DP showed a
   better-defined microstructure and retained more water retention at near
   saturation conditions than WP. Soil treatments have a significant effect
   on rho(b), SPR, S1-10, K1-10 and on the WRC parameters. Overall, rho(b)
   and SPR was the lowest under MB, with maximal S1-10 and K1-10 values
   under C. Compared to C and F, MB presented the highest volume of
   structural porosity and the lowest water retention at near saturation

   sequestration rate of 7.84 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1),
   respectively. The soil organic carbon pools, carbon sequestration and
   rate of carbon sequestration as observed in treatment of balanced
   fertilization (100\%NPK) were significantly increased from 9.19 to 9.99
   Mg C ha(-1), 3.30 to 4.10 Mg C ha(-1) and 037 to 0.46 Mg C ha(-1)
   yr(-1), respectively when farmyard manure was applied in conjunction
   with 100\%NPK. The application of 100\%NPK and 100\%NPK + FYM
   significantly increased the soil labile carbon (1378 and 1578 mg kg(-1),
   respectively), water soluble carbon (35.3 and 37.2 mg kg, respectively)
   and water soluble carbohydrates (526 and 538 mg kg(-1), respectively) as
   compared to the control, where the corresponding values were 898, 16.8
   and 464 mg kg(-1). The content of water stable aggregates organic carbon
   also increased with fertilization especially in combination with
   farmyard manure, whereas bulk density of soil was significantly reduced
   in the treatment of 100\%NPK (1.49 Mg m(-3)) and 100\%NPK + FYM (1.46 Mg
   m(-3)) over the control (1.60 Mg m(-3)). The fertilizer treatments
   (100\%N, 100\%NP and 100\%NPK) made a positive influence on soil organic
   carbon content in subsurface layers (15-60 cm) also and it was more so
   in the treatment of 100\%NPK + FYM as compared to the control, although
   contents did not differ significantly. Balanced fertilization (100\%NPK)
   with and without FYM significantly improved the labile C content of soil
   (up to depth of 60 cm) over the control. Balanced fertilization in
   combination with FYM significantly increased the water soluble carbon
   content of soil in comparison to the control (up to depth of 60 cm).
   Bulk density of sub surface soil (15-60 cm) was reduced in all the
   treatments as compared to the control although the treatment effect was
   nonsignificant. The rice-wheat cropping sequence thus, showed the
   potential of mitigating atmospheric carbon load through its
   sequestration and integrated nutrient management may further enhance
   this potential. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has been vital for meeting global food
   demand but has caused environmental degradation. This has disrupted the
   ability of soil to provide vital ecosystem services. Organic farming is
   often thought to conserve and utilise soil ecosystem services, and thus
   be a more sustainable method of food production than conventional
   farming. However, evidence for this is equivocal, and little is known of
   the potential trade-offs between soil functions, which can be classified
   as supporting and provisioning ecosystem services, in conventional and
   organic systems. In addition, few studies have simultaneously examined
   how surrounding landscape heterogeneity affects soil functions in
   agriculture. In this study we investigated the effects of farming method
   (conventional versus organic) and landscape heterogeneity (100 m, 500 m
   and 1000 m radius) on indicators of soil ecosystem services: soil
   organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water holding capacity (WHC)
   and plant-available phosphorous (P) (measures of carbon storage and
   nutrient retention); net N mineralisation and microbial community
   composition and biomass (nutrient cycling); and crop yield. We found no
   effect of landscape heterogeneity, and no differences in any of the
   measured soil and microbial variables between conventional and organic
   farms, apart from net N mineralisation, which was higher in organic
   farms. However, conventional farms had significantly greater yield than
   organic farms, and there was no apparent trade-off between increasing
   yield and the level of supporting ecosystem services. The organic farms
   in this study appear to have been intensively managed, with a straight
   substitution of organic inputs for chemicals, but little other effort to
   enhance soil fertility. For example, the organic farms applied large
   quantities of manure compared with conventional farms but conducted
   mechanical weeding (harrowing), whereas conventional farms applied
   herbicides. This repeated soil disturbance may cause rapid organic
   matter mineralisation and undermine the ability of these organic farms
   to retain carbon and nitrogen. The terms `organic' and `conventional'
   agriculture both cover a wide variety of farming methods, some of which
   enhance or deplete ecosystem services more than others. To develop truly
   sustainable methods of agriculture, research should focus on the effects
   of specific farming practices, rather than the labels `conventional' and
   `organic'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A clearer understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the development

   restoration of degraded soil. A hierarchical model of soil aggregation
   (HM) is posited that predicts soils to be self-organising systems,

   constituents, organic matter and biotic activity, which serve to create
   and stabilise soil structure. To determine the contribution of these
   latter constituents, combinations of organic matter (compost), living
   plant roots (three perennial species: two woody, one grass) and a
   community of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi where added to a massive
   mine spoil in a controlled pot experiment. It was hypothesized that the
   absence of any of these three components would retard the development of
   stable soil structure, as assessed through the development of porosity,
   changes in bulk density, soil water retention characteristics and
   water-stable aggregation following a 6 month incubation period. The
   concentration and content of soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, cation
   exchange capacity and pH were also determined. All three factors,
   organic matter, living plant roots and AM fungi were required for the
   development of stable soil structure, but in complex ways. Overall, the
   data indicate that in the presence of adequate organic matter, plant
   roots are key contributors to the development of soil structure which is
   further stabilized by AM fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Low-intensity soil management systems like no-tillage (NT) are being
   increasingly accepted as an essential part of sustainable farming
   systems. The objective of this work was to study the effects of NT
   maintenance over time on soil aggregation and soil organic carbon (SOC)
   protection on a semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystem. A NT
   chronosequence was established with five phases: (i) conventional
   tillage (Cr); (ii) NT for I year (NT-1); (iii) NT for 4 years (NT-4);
   (iv) NT for 11 years (NT-11) and (v) NT for 20 years (NT-20). N
   fertilization was based on pig slurry for the whole experimental area.
   Soil samples were collected from four depths (i.e., 0-5,5-10,
   10-20,20-30 cm). Dry and water-stable aggregates, SOC concentration and
   C concentration of water-stable aggregates were measured. SOC
   concentration reached its maximum value after 11 years under NT.
   However, the differences between NT phases were only found in the 0-5 cm
   soil depth. In soil surface (i.e., 0-5 cm), water-stable large
   macroaggregates (2-8 mm) were 0.02, 0.12, 0.32 and 0.31 g g(-1) dry soil
   for the NT-1, NT-4, NT-11 and NT-20 phases, respectively. C
   concentration of microaggregates increased in relation with the number
   of years under NT. SOC and water-stable macroaggregate stratification
   were greatest with the increase in the years under NT, emphasizing the
   close relationship between SOC and aggregation. In Mediterranean
   semiarid agroecosystems, the increase in the proportion of stable
   macroaggregates and the enrichment of C concentration within
   microaggregates are two main mechanisms of SOC protection when NT is
   maintained over time. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Increase in soil nutrients in intensively managed cash-crop agricultural
   ecosystems in the Guanting Reservoir catchment, Beijing, China}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{102-108}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Since the late 1970s, transitions in socioeconomic status and new
   governmental policies have led to drastic changes in agricultural land
   use types and farm management practices across rural China, such as an
   increase in the area of land cultivated for cash-crops (e.g. vegetables
   and orchards) and intensive fertilization and irrigation of this land.
   How this more intensive management and land use for the more profitable
   cash crops affects soil nutrients is of great concern for carbon, soil
   and water quality management In this paper, we attempted to assess the
   influence of cash crop ecosystems on soil nutrients in the catchment
   upstream of the Guanting Reservoir, in the Beijing municipality, North
   China plain. Soil nutrients in cash crop (orchard and vegetable)
   ecosystems with between 8 and 20 years of intensive management history
   were compared with traditional agro-ecosystem management patterns (corn
   and soybean). Results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) had
   improved, and total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P)
   concentrations had marginally increased under intensive management
   practices in the vegetable and orchard ecosystems in the last 25 years.
   The increases in SOC and total P densities at the 100 cm soil depth in
   orchard, vegetable and irrigated corn systems were greater than those in
   the rain fed corn and soybean systems. Soil available P and electrical
   conductivity (EC) were highest in the vegetable lands. However, no
   significant changes were found between the soil physical properties
   (i.e. bulk density, clay content and water stable aggregate content) of
   the traditional and cash-cropping systems. Multi regression analysis
   showed that manure and mineral fertilizer contributed significantly to
   the increase in soil nutrients. Intensively managed orchards are a
   better option for improving soil quality and SOC sequestration. However,
   the risks of nonpoint source pollution from, and soil salinization in,
   the land used for vegetable cultivation should be considered in the
   future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   effect and the response to compressive stress}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{236-245}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Long-term field trials provide an ideal means to assess effects of
   cultivation practises (e.g., fertilisation, tillage, crop rotation etc.)
   on soil physical properties and soil fertility. To build upon the
   knowledge of the role of organic carbon (OC) and other soil properties
   on soil response to compressive stress, undisturbed soil cores were
   collected from a long-term fertilisation experiment in Bad Lauchstadt in
   Germany, including combinations of animal manure and mineral
   fertilisers. The cores were drained to -100 hPa matric potential and
   exposed to uniaxial confined compression (200 kPa). Investigated
   indicators for compression response included compression index,
   precompression stress, and resistance and resilience indices based on
   measured soil physical properties (air permeability, and void ratio).
   Soil resilience was assessed following exposure of compacted cores to
   freeze-thaw (FT) and wet-dry (WD) cycles. The OC content increased with
   increased fertilisation and resulted in decreased initial bulk density,
   higher air-filled and total porosities, and increased organisation of
   the pore space. Soil resistance decreased with increasing OC content but
   the correlation was not significant. However, initial bulk density
   (rho(bi)) and initial gravimetric water content (w(i)) were
   significantly positively correlated to the indices of soil compression
   resistance, with the effect of rho(bi) being significantly stronger.
   Significant recovery of air-filled void ratio and air permeability was
   observed following exposure to FT and WD cycles, with the latter cycle
   showing higher recovery levels. The OC and rho(bi) significantly
   influenced the magnitude of recovery following FT cycles, with pi),
   showing contrasting trends on void ratio after both WD and FT cycles. It
   was concluded that the main drivers influencing soil response to
   compressive stress are rho(bi) and w(i). No direct influence of OC was
   observed, rather the indirect effect of OC was seen through lower
   rho(bi), and greater w(i) associated with higher OC levels. Further
   studies are required to differentiate the relative effects of OC,
   rho(bi) and w(i) for variably-textured soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorhizal fungi (AMF) produce a glycoprotein (glomalin)
   important for soil structure, fertility and therefore plant nutrition
   which can be used to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices on
   soil quality across many land use systems. In the present study, its
   influence was investigated on soil fertility and aggregation in 3
   different land use systems of the humid forest zone of southern
   Cameroon. Soils were sampled at 10 cm depth from 03 native forest, 03
   fallow and 03 continuous growing fields systems at Metet (South
   Cameroon) for the determination of easily extractable glomalin (EEG),
   total glomalin (TG), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and soil water stable
   aggregate of 1-2 mm diameter (WSA(1-2mm)). Results showed that both EEG
   and TG concentrations significantly decreased (P < 0.01) from the forest
   to the growing field, via the fallow system. The rate of EEG decrease
   was 29.82 \% and 38.35 \% in the fallow and the growing field system
   compared to the forest system, respectively. For TG, the decrease rate
   was 16.65 \% to 46.04 \% for the fallow and the growing field system
   compare to the forest system respectively; while C, N, and organic
   matter (OM) did not changed significantly. The proportion of C, N and OM
   were 93.6 \%, 88.3 \%, 93.7 \% for the growing field system compared to
   the forest system respectively. The WSA(1-2mm) decreased from the forest
   to fallow and growing field systems, with respective rates of 19.69\%
   and 32.81 \%. There was high positive correlation between C, N and EEG
   (r(2) = 0.76, 0.55; P < 0.01), suggesting the possible implication of
   glomalin to soil stock of C and N. Likewise, the high positive
   correlation between TG and WSA(1-2mm) (r(2) = 0.64, P < 0.01), C and TG
   (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.05), OM and WSA(1-2mm) (r(2) = 0.57, P < 0.01) as
   well as OM and TG (r(2) = 0.88, P < 0.01) suggests that glomalin, C and
   N may contribute to the formation of WSA(1-2mm), and thereby promote the
   build up of soil structure. These results highlight the view that
   glomalin can be used as an indicator of soil fertility in this region
   and should be consider as a criteria when define agricultural management
   strategies.}},

   used to calculate the SQI values for the different treatments. Results
   revealed that treatment of soil tillage methods improved yield of maize

Abstract = {{There are no previous reports regarding the use of hydrophobic sand
   layer in aridland agriculture datepalm cultivation. In this study we
   tested the influence of different layers of nano-sand (hydrophobic sand)
   to reduce soil water requirements, and plant growth performance.
   Hydrophobic sand made by using nanotechnology is a novel concept, in
   which the natural sweet sand is coated with nano particles of pure
   silica by vapours of a silicon compound called trimethylhydroxysilane
   (CH3)(3)SiOH by special chemical treatment. Datepalm (Phoenix
   dactylifera L.) tree is the most popular and important tree in UAE, it
   is mainly cultivated in sandy soil. This type of soil is characterized
   by low organic matter, high infiltration rate, and low water holding
   capacity, low nutrient holding capacity and low fertility. Under these
   conditions, hydrophobic sand may be a key factor in improving the crop
   growth. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the effect
   of hydrophobic sand application on growth of datepalm, to determine the
   uptake of nutrients and heavy metals by crop and to evaluate the major
   chemical and physical properties of the soil as affected by hydrophobic
   sand application. The results were promising, the application of
   hydrophobic sand gave the highest shoot and root fresh and dry weights
   of datepalm seedlings compared to control. Root length of datepalm
   seedlings was strongly affected by application of hydrophobic sand
   especially in the second growing season 2009-2010 in which there was
   40\% increment in the root length compared to control. The results of
   heavy metal concentrations in date palm leaves and roots showed that the
   heavy metal levels (Cd, Mo, Pb and Se) were within the recommended
   level. The heavy metal concentrations in datepalm soil were within the

Abstract = {{New technologies, specific to sustainable agriculture, require

   minimum tillage and no-tillage systems represent alternatives to the
   conventional system of soil tillage, due to their conservation effects
   on soil features and to the assured productions, maize: 96-98.1\% at
   minimum tillage and 99.8\% at no-tillage, soybean: 102.9-111.9\% at
   minimum tillage and 117.2\% at no-tillage, wheat: 93.4-96.8\% at minimum

   rotation helps reduce energy consumption, thus maize: 97.3-97.9\% at
   minimum tillage and 91.3\% at no-tillage, soybean: 98.6-98.2\% at
   minimum tillage and 92.8\% at no-tillage, wheat: 97.4-98\% at minimum
   tillage and 91.6\% at no-tillage. Energy efficiency is in relation to
   reductions in energy savings, but also with efficiency and impact on the
   tillage system on the cultivated plant. For all crops in rotation,
   energy efficiency (energy produced from 1 MJ consumed) was best in
   no-tillage and 10.44 MJ ha(-1) at maize, 6.49 MJ ha(-1) at soybean and
   5.66 MJ ha(-1) at wheat. Energy-efficient agricultural system: the
   energy consumed-energy produced-energy yield, necessarily have to be
   supplemented by soil energy efficiency, with the conservative effect of
   the agricultural system. Only then the agricultural system will be
   sustainable, durable in agronomic, economic and ecological terms. The
   implementation of minimum and no-tillage soil systems have increased the
   organic matter content from 2 to 7.6\% and water-stable aggregate
   content from 5.6 to 9.6\%, at 0-30 cm depth, as compared to the
   conventional system. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate
   stability have initially been low, the effect of conservation practices
   on the soil characteristics led to a positive impact on the water
   permeability in the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop
   growth led to a better plant watering condition. Subsequent release of
   conserved soil water regulated proper plant water condition and soil
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{An attempt was made in this investigation to deteimine the impact of the
   following four systems of soil agricultural use: not subjected to any
   reclamation treatment, fodder-cereal reclamation treatment, rape-cereal
   reclamation treatment and the so-called ``conservation{''} treatment
   (permanent lucerne) on the properties of soils developing from
   post-mining grounds. A particular attention was paid to the properties
   of the humus layer of the developing soils, among them, their texture
   which belongs to the most important soil diagnostic features.
   Experiments were carried out in 2010 on the experimental field of the
   Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of Life
   Sciences in Poznan. A combination without mineral fertilisation (0NPK)
   was established on each of the analysed use systems. In the case of the
   fodder-cereal and rape-cereal systems, additionally, two levels of
   mineral fertilisation: 1NPK in rape-cereal system (rape: 200 kg N, 70 kg
   P2O5, 90 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and in fodder-
   cereal (lucerne: 170 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 150 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40
   kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and 2NPK were applied. The control was post-mining
   ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment.
   The evaluation of changes in the selected, most important soil structure
   parameters was based on the original methodological solution elaborated
   at the Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of
   Life Sciences in Poznan in which the basic element is a regular soil
   aggregate of 1 cm(3) volume. The following parameters were determined
   for such aggregates cut out from two depths of the humus layer (7 and 15
   cm): dynamic water resistance (SW), static water resistance (SW),
   secondary aggregation after dynamic and static water action, time of
   capillary rise (T-kmin), capillary minimal (V-kmin) and maximal (V-kmax)
   water capacity and compression strength (Rc). The above-mentioned
   properties were determined in 5 replications. Using methods commonly
   employed in soil science, the following parameters were determined:
   texture composition, solid phase density, bulk density and porosity,
   hygroscopic capacity and maximal hygroscopic capacity as well as soil
   reaction and carbonate, carbon and nitrogen contents.
   Reclamation treatments applied in the course of the past 32 years and
   soil-forming processes taking place under their influence led to
   distinct changes in the morphological structure of the examined
   profiles, primarily, in their surface layer. The smallest morphological
   changes were observed in the profile sampled from the plot with
   long-term lucerne cultivation (so-called ``conservation{''}). The
   profiles representing the fodder-cereal use system exhibited a more
   advanced stadium of soil-forming processes. Their humus layer was more
   distinctive, with dark colour, its thickness ranged from 20 to 28 cm
   corresponding to the depth of the performed ploughing. Identical
   features and better homogeneity were observed in the case of the humus
   horizon developed in the rape-cereal system of agricultural use,
   although certain differences were recorded in profile morphology
   depending on the level of the applied mineral fertilisation (1NPK and
   2NPK).
   Post-mining ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment
   was found to contain the smallest quantities of organic material carbon
   and nitrogen (2.65-2.84 g.kg(-1)). The amount of oxidisable carbon in
   the fodder-cereal system of agricultural use was 2.5 to 3 times higher
   (6.45-8.82 g.kg(-1)) than in the untreated post-mining ground
   irrespective of the level of mineral fertilisation. On the other hand,
   the amount of carbon was more varied in the rape-cereal system of use.
   In the case of absence of fertilisation (0NPK), this quantity was by
   about 50\% higher in comparison with the post-mining ground and amounted
   to 3.1 g.kg(-1). Elevated fertilisation with 1NPK and 2NPK doses
   increased levels of carbon to values similar as in the fodder-cereal
   system. The highest quantity of carbon of about 12 g.kg(-1) was recorded
   in the humus horizon developed on the surface representing permanent
   lucerne (so-called ``conservation{''}).
   A distinct variability was also observed in the physical properties of
   soils from the examined systems of agricultural use. Untreated
   post-mining grounds were characterised by high bulk density (1.97-2.02
   Mg.m(-3)) and, consequently, by low general porosity (23.6 to 25.3\%).
   In the fodder-cereal use system, soil density was found to be by about
   0.30 Mg.m(-3) lower and porosity by about 10\% higher. In the case of
   the rape-cereal system of agricultural use, soil density was only by
   about 0.1 Mg.m(-3) higher and general porosity by about 5\% lower in
   comparison with the fodder-cereal system. Bulk density and general
   porosity in the so-called ``conservation{''} system of use amounted to
   1.35-1.51 Mg.m(-3) and 42.8-48.9\%, respectively, in other words,
   exhibited the most advantageous values of these features from the point
   of view of agricultural usage.
   Recapitulating, it should be emphasised that widely distinguished two
   soil-forming factors, namely: time and human activity begin to play a
   dominant role in the formation of soils, especially in areas which
   undergo large industrial geomechanical transformations mainly as a
   result of open-cast mining of different minerals.}},

   cultivation increased bulk density and reduced the void ratio, total

Abstract = {{Most of the world's grasslands are managed for livestock production. A
   critical component of the long-term sustainability and profitability of
   rangelands (e. g., grazed grassland ecosystems) is the maintenance of
   plant production. Amending grassland soils with organic waste has been
   proposed as a means to increase net primary productivity (NPP) and
   ecosystem carbon (C) storage, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
   from waste management. Few studies have evaluated the effects of
   amendments on the C balance and greenhouse gas dynamics of grasslands.
   We used field manipulations replicated within and across two rangelands
   (a valley grassland and a coastal grassland) to determine the effects of
   a single application of composted green waste amendments on NPP and
   greenhouse gas emissions over three years. Amendments elevated total
   soil respiration by 18\% +/- 4\% at both sites but had no effect on
   nitrous oxide or methane emissions. Carbon losses were significantly
   offset by greater and sustained plant production. Amendments stimulated
   both above-and belowground NPP by 2.1 +/- 0.8 Mg C/ha to 4.7 +/- 0.7 Mg
   C/ha (mean +/- SE) over the three-year study period. Net ecosystem C
   storage increased by 25-70\% without including the direct addition of
   compost C. The estimated magnitude of net ecosystem C storage was
   sensitive to estimates of heterotrophic soil respiration but was greater
   than controls in five out of six fields that received amendments. The
   sixth plot was the only one that exhibited lower soil moisture than the
   control, suggesting an important role of water limitation in these
   seasonally dry ecosystems. Treatment effects persisted over the course
   of the study, which were likely derived from increased water-holding
   capacity in most plots, and slow-release fertilization from compost
   decomposition. We conclude that a single application of composted
   organic matter can significantly increase grassland C storage, and that
   effects of a single application are likely to carry over in time.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilization plays an important role in soil fertility and rice yield.
   A long-term (19902006) field experiment was conducted at a typical
   subtropical hilly agriculture region in south central China. The
   objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of long-term
   fertilizations on i) accumulations and distributions of soil carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in different sizes of water-stable
   aggregates (WSA); ii) dynamic change of soil C, N, and P over years; and
   iii) the rice yield. Application of organic materials (OM), especially
   in combination with chemical fertilizers, increased soil organic C
   (SOC), soil total N (NT), and soil total P (PT) concentrations in all
   sizes of WSA, and they more concentrated in WSA (>1 mm). However, single
   chemical fertilizers had little impact on SOC and NT. There were
   significantly positive correlations between SOC and NT in each size of
   WSA, (r0.977, n = 15, P < 0.01). It illuminated that application of
   organic materials benefited the conservation of soil nitrogen. However,
   application of organic materials had less impact on PT. Variation of C/P
   was larger than C/N. PT was mainly affected by input of phosphorus. Data
   over years showed that SOC and NT continued to rise, whereas PT tended
   to decline irrespective of treatments. Furthermore, economical chemical
   fertilizers application combining with green manure and half straw
   returning (NPKe + SR) can produce approximate effects on PT as
   conventional dose of chemical fertilizers (NPKc). Average rice yield of
   NPKc for 17years was 9399kg ha1. Compared with NPKc, OM decreased yield
   by only 4.4\%, which indicated that traditional organic fertilization
   could obtain relatively high yield. NPKe + SR obtained approximate yield
   as NPKc did, which showed that green manure and half amount of straw
   effectually reduced chemical fertilizers by about one third.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture based on no-tillage (CA/NT) becomes a current
   tendency to enhance crop productivity by improving: (i) soil quality,
   (ii) water management and (iii) organic supply. In Tunisia, the
   applicability of CA was poorly documented. This study was carried out to
   evaluate changes in soil organic matter (SUM) and water properties
   generated by seven (NT7) and three (NT3) years of applying NT as
   compared to conventional tillage (CT). On three adjacent large plots, a
   field experiment was established since the growing season 2000/01 under
   rain-fed conditions on a clay loam soil in a dry subhumid zone of North
   Tunisia. In NT3 plot, a cultivation of wheat/fava bean sequence was
   investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 450 kg ha(-1)
   were left on the soil surface for wheat and fava bean, respectively. In
   NT7 plot, a cultivation of wheat/sulla sequence was investigated and
   residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 700 kg ha(-1) were left on the
   soil surface for wheat and sulla, respectively. However for the CT plot,
   a moldboard plowing at approximately 20 cm depth was managed for
   continuous wheat production. The selected key parameters evaluated for a
   0-30 cm soil profile were SOM, bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP),
   macro-porosity (MP), micro-porosity (mP), soil water retention at field
   capacity (FC) and at permanent wilting point (PWP), available water
   content (AWC) and soil moisture content (SMC).
   NT7 have increased significantly (p < 0.05) levels of SOM at the top 30
   cm soil layer, which in turn enhanced BD and TP of soil as compared to
   CT. However, improvement of these parameters was restricted to 0-10 cm
   layer with NT3. Both NT3 and NT7 have increased considerably (p < 0.05)
   mP at 030 cm thereby increasing soil water content at FC and PWP,
   whereas MP was remarkably reduced by NT treatments as compared to CT but
   reduction was less important in NT7 plot. AWC was significantly (p <
   0.05) higher in NT7 across the 30 cm profile while NT3 and CT have
   similar effect to each other. SMC was improved at different soil depths
   by NT system during the whole agricultural season and the highest
   content was found with NT3. Soil moisture values increased with
   increasing soil depth in both NT3 and NT7 indicating a good water
   infiltration induced by these treatments. Hence, water storage
   properties in rooting zone could be enhanced by NT7 and NT3 but water
   availability for plants was more important with NT7. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Considering extreme events of climate change and declining availability
   of appropriate quality water and/or highly productive soil resources for
   agriculture in dryland regions, the need to produce more food, forage
   and fibre will necessitate the effective utilization of marginal-quality
   water and soil resources. Recent research and practices have
   demonstrated that effective utilization of these natural resources in
   dry areas can improve agricultural productivity per unit area and per
   unit water applied. This paper focuses on the following three case
   studies as examples: (1) low productivity soils affected by high levels
   of magnesium in soil solution and on the cation exchange complex; (2)
   degraded sandy soils under rainfed conditions characterized by low
   water-holding capacity, organic matter and clay content and (3)
   abandoned irrigated soils with elevated levels of salts inhibiting
   growth of income generating crops. The results of these studies
   demonstrate that application of calcium-supplying phosphogypsum to
   high-magnesium soils, addition of clays to light textured degraded soils
   and phytoremediation of abandoned salt-affected soils significantly
   improved productivity of these soils. Furthermore, under most
   circumstances, these interventions were economically viable, revealing
   that the efficient use of marginal-quality water and soil resources has
   the potential to improve livelihoods amid growing populations in dry
   areas while reversing the natural resource degradation trend. However,
   considerably more investment and policy-level interventions are needed
   to tackle soil degradation/remediation issues across both irrigated and
   dryland agricultural environments if the major challenge of producing
   enough food, forage and fibre is to be met. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Abstract = {{Soil structure is the combination or arrangement of primary soil
   particles into secondary units that are characterized on the basis of
   size, shape, and grade. Stability of soil structure describes the
   ability of the soil to retain its arrangement of solid and pore space
   (i.e., aggregates and pores) when exposed to external forces (e.g.,
   tillage, cropping, compaction and irrigation). Studying the effects of
   agricultural management practices on soil structure is important for the
   development of effective soil conservation practices to avoid risks of
   soil deterioration. The current review presents and discusses results of
   water retention curves at near saturation (matric potential, psi, 0 to
   -5 J kg(-1)) obtained by the High Energy Moisture Characteristic (HEMC)
   method for >200 soil samples from humid and arid zones. Quantifying
   differences in the water retention curves using the modified van
   Genuchten model (Soil-HEMC) yielded soil structure indices which were
   then used to elucidate in quantitative terms possible interactions among
   soil physical processes and management practices. Analyses of the water
   retention curves indicated that kaolinitic humid zone soils are (i) more
   stable than smectitc semiarid zone soils, and (ii) less sensitive to
   management, soil texture, organic matter content and wetting rate.
   Parameters of the van Genuchten model were successfully employed for
   evaluation of the contribution of large (>0.25-0.50 mm) and small
   (<0.25-0.50 mm) aggregates/particles to the pore size distribution and
   soil structure condition. The presented detailed analyses of the
   contribution of soil inherent properties and extrinsic conditions (e.g.,
   spatiotemporal variation) to inter-and intra-aggregate porosity, the
   soil structure indices and model parameters at near saturation, sheds
   additional light on the processes that are involved in stabilizing soil
   structure, and may assist in developing more efficient soil and
   environment management practices.}},

Abstract = {{In semiarid areas, low and erratic rainfall, together with the intensive
   agricultural use of soils, has depleted soil organic carbon and degraded
   the soil's chemical, biological and physical fertility. To develop
   efficient soil-management practices for the rapid restoration of
   severely degraded soils, no-till, mulch-based cropping systems have been
   adopted. Thus, a study was conducted on a farm to evaluate the effect of
   a no-tillage system (NT) versus conventional tillage (CT) on the
   vertical (0-50 cm) distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk
   density (BD), total porosity (TP), structural instability (SI), stable
   aggregates and infiltration coefficient (Ks) in a clay loam soil under
   rain-fed conditions in a semiarid region of northwestern Tunisia. CT
   consisting of moldboard plowing to a depth of 20 cm was used for
   continuous wheat production. NT by direct drilling under residue was
   used for 3 (NT3) and 7 (NT7) years in wheat/fava bean and wheat/sulla
   crop rotations, respectively. SOC was more significantly increased (p <
   0.05) by NT3 and NT7 than by CT at respective depths of 0-10 and 0-20
   cm, but a greater increase in the uppermost 10 cm of soil was observed
   in the NT7 field. NT3 management decreased BD and consequently increased
   TP at a depth of 0-10 cm. The same trend was observed for the NT7
   treatment at a depth of 0-30 cm. Ks was not affected by the NT3
   treatment but was improved at a depth of 0-30 cm by the NT7 treatment.
   Changes in BD, TP and Ks in the NT7 plot were significant only in the
   first 10 cm of the soil. Both NT3 and NT7 considerably reduced SI (p <
   0.1) and enhanced stable aggregates (p < 0.05) across the soil profile.
   These differences were most pronounced under NT7 at a depth of 0-10 cm.
   The stratification ratio (SR) of the selected soil properties, except
   that of SI, showed significant differences between the CT and NT trials,
   indicating an improvement in soil quality.
   NT management in the farming systems of north-western Tunisia was
   demonstrated in this study to improve soil quality, especially in the
   surface layers, by increasing storage of organic carbon and enhancing
   the physical properties of the soil. These effects were most pronounced
   in the long term. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of conservation agriculture on catchment runoff and soil loss
   under changing climate conditions in May Zeg-zeg (Ethiopia)}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the practice of conservation agriculture (CA) in
   the May Zeg-zeg catchment (MZZ; 187 ha) in the North Ethiopian Highlands
   as a soil management technique for reducing soil loss and runoff, and
   assesses the consequences of future large-scale implementation on soil
   and hydrology at catchment-level. The study of such practice is
   important especially under conditions of climate change, since EdGCM
   (Educational Global Climate Model) simulation predicts by 2040 an
   increase in precipitation by more than 100 mm yr(-1) in the study area.
   Firstly, field-saturated infiltration rates, together with soil texture
   and soil organic carbon contents, were measured. The relation with local
   topography allows to generate a pedotransfer function for
   field-saturated infiltration rate, and spatial interpolation with Linear
   Regression Mapping was used to map field-saturated infiltration rates
   optimally within the catchment. Secondly, on several farmlands, CA was
   checked against plain tillage (PT) for values of field-saturated
   infiltration rates, soil organic carbon, runoff and soil loss. Results
   show no significant differences for infiltration rates but significant
   differences for runoff and soil loss (as measured in the period
   2005-2011). Runoff coefficients were 30.4\% for PT and 18.8\% for CA;
   soil losses were 35.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) for PT and 14.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1)
   for CA. Thirdly, all collected information was used to predict future
   catchment hydrological response for full-implementation of CA under the
   predicted wetter climate (simulation with EdGCM). Curve Numbers for
   farmlands with CA were calculated. An area-weighted Curve Number allows
   the simulation of the 2011 rainy season runoff, predicting a total
   runoff depth of 23.5 mm under CA and 27.9 mm under PT. Furthermore, the
   Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation management factor P was calibrated
   for CA. Results also show the important influence of increased surface
   roughness on water ponding, modeled with a hydrologic conservation
   balance. By coupling this model with the infiltration rate map, a
   `ponding map' of the catchment was established. Finally, a sediment
   budget for a full future implementation scenario of CA has been
   estimated, predicting a large impact of CA on sheet and rill erosion
   rates, since total soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion in cropland
   would become 581 t yr(-1) instead of 1109 t yr(-1), if CA would be
   practiced in MZZ. Simulation of several policy scenarios shows that
   especially under a future wetter North-East-African climate, CA would be
   a beneficial alternative for the current plain tillage, as it will
   increase infiltration and keep runoff coefficients under control. (C)

Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{284-291}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to study the influence of four process
   variables (turning frequency, gas-phase oxygen level, type of bulking
   agent and sludge/bulking agent mixing ratio) on the performance of the
   sewage sludge composting process using a rotary drum pilot scale
   reactor, in order to optimize the thermophilic stage and reduce the
   processing time. Powdered sawdust, wood shavings, wood chips, prunings
   waste and straw were used as bulking agents and the thermophilic stage
   temperature profile was used as the main indicator for gauging if the
   composting process was developing correctly. Our results showed that a
   12 h(-1) turning frequency and an oxygen concentration of 10\% were the
   optimal conditions for the composting process to develop. The best
   results were obtained by mixing the sewage sludge with wood shavings in
   a 3:1 w/w ratio (on a wet basis), which adapted the initial moisture
   content and porosity to an optimal range and led to a maximum
   temperature of 70 degrees C being reached thus ensuring the complete
   removal of pathogens. Moisture, C:N ratio, pH, organic matter, heavy
   metals, pathogens and stability were all analysed for every mixture
   obtained at the end of the thermophilic stage. These parameters were
   compared with the limits established by the Spanish regulation on
   fertilizers (RD 824/2005) in order to assess if the compost obtained
   could be used on agricultural soils. The right combination of having
   optimal process variables combined with an appropriate reactor design
   allowed the thermophilic stage of the composting process to be speeded
   up, hence obtaining a compost product, after just two weeks of
   processing that (with the exception of the moisture content) complied
   with the Spanish legal requirements for fertilizers, without requiring a
   later maturation stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Stream Discharge in Tropical Headwater Catchments as a Result of Forest
   Clearing and Soil Degradation}},
Journal = {{EARTH INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tropical Africa is affected by intense land-use change, particularly
   forest conversion to agricultural land. In this study, the stream
   discharge of four small headwater catchments located within an area of 6
   km 2 in western Kenya was examined for 2 years (2007 and 2008). The four
   catchments cover a degradation gradient ranging from intact forest to
   agricultural land under maize cultivation for 5, 10, and 50 years. The
   runoff ratio (e. g., annual catchment discharge expressed as a
   percentage of rainfall) increased with increasing duration of
   cultivation from an average of 16.0\% in the forest to 32.4\% in the
   50-yr-old agricultural catchment. Similarly, the average runoff ratio
   due to the stormflow component was 0.033 in the forest and increased
   gradually to 0.095 with increasing duration of cultivation. The
   conversion from forest to agricultural land in the first 5 years caused
   about half of the total observed increases in runoff ratio (46.3\%) and
   discharge in relation to rainfall (50.6\%). The other half of the
   changes in discharge occurred later during soil degradation after forest
   clearing. With increasing duration of cultivation, soil bulk density
   rho(b) at a depth of 0-0.1 m increased by 46\%, while soil organic
   carbon (SOC) concentrations and total porosity decreased by 75\% and
   20\%, respectively. The changes in hydrological responses that occurred
   in the initial years after forest clearing may suggest a significant
   potential for improved land management in alleviating runoff and
   enhanced storm flow and moisture retention in agricultural watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{The management of irrigation water presents a great challenge for the
   agriculture field. In view of increasing soil water-holding capacity and
   increasing water-use efficiency, an efficient strategy of managing
   irrigation water based on formulating highly absorbent polymer-inorganic
   clay composite (polyacrylic acid-layered double hydroxide: PAA-LDH) was
   offered. The PAA-LDH composite was synthesized by an incorporation/in
   situ polymerization technique. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
   analysis and infrared spectroscopy were used to confirm the composite
   structure. The thermal gravimetric analysis was applied to investigate
   the polymer thermal stability after the composite formation. The
   irrigation experiments were conducted in a wooden soil box with a
   transparent plexiglas side by using a subsurface drip irrigation system.
   The X-ray patterns and infrared spectra confirmed the incorporation of
   acrylic acid monomer (AA) into the gallery of LDH. The SEM images
   emphasized the composite structure of PAA-LDH and indicated its ability
   to absorb and keep water. The stability of PAA was promoted against the
   thermal decomposition after the composite formation. The composite
   structure of PAA-LDH worked as water barrier and secondary water source
   during the irrigation process. The soil moisture distribution patterns
   were enhanced after the application of PAA-LDH composites as a soil
   conditioner. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the changes occurred in a set of soil attributes,

   commercial sites under these agroecosystems were compared to neighboring
   areas of native forest in five areas along this region (Coruripe,
   Umbauba, Acajutiba, Cruz das Almas and Nova Vicosa). Soil samples were
   taken from 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth and analyzed for particle size
   distribution, bulk density, organic C (OC), particulate organic matter,
   C in soil solution, microbial biomass C, total cation exchange capacity
   and water stable aggregates. Linear correlation and multivariate
   techniques were used for data analysis. The values of base saturation

   all the studied areas, soils under native forest presented better status
   of physical and chemical attributes than their agroecosystem
   counterparts, especially in the 0-5 cm layer. For both layers, OC
   content was the attribute most strongly correlated with the overall
   changes in all attributes. Unexpectedly, the OC content showed no
   significant correlation with the sum of silt and clay contents. The set

Abstract = {{An essential prerequisite for a sustainable soil use is to maintain a
   satisfactory soil organic-matter (OM) level. This might be achieved by
   sound fertilization management, though impacts of fertilization on OM
   have been rarely investigated with the aid of physical fractionation
   techniques in semiarid regions. This study aimed at examining changes in
   organic C (OC) and N concentrations of physically separated soil OM
   pools after 26 y of fertilization at a site of the semiarid Loess
   Plateau in China. To separate sensitive OM pools, total macro-OM (>
   0.05?mm) was obtained from bulk soil by wet-sieving and then separated
   into light macro-OM (< 1.8 g?cm3) and heavy macro-OM (> 1.8 g?cm3)
   subfractions; bulk soil was also differentiated into light OM (< 1.8
   g?cm3) and mineral-associated OM (> 1.8 g?cm3). Farmyard manure
   increased concentrations of total macro-OC and N by 19\% and 25\%, and
   those of light fraction OC and N by 36\% and 46\%, compared to no
   manuring; both light OC and N concentrations but only total macro-OC
   concentration responded positively to mineral fertilizations compared to
   no mineral fertilization. This demonstrated that the light-fraction OM
   was more sensitive to organic or inorganic fertilization than the total
   macro-OM. Mineral-associated OC and N concentrations also increased by
   manuring or mineral fertilizations, indicating an increase of stable OM
   relative to no fertilization treatment, however, their shares on bulk
   soil OC and N decreased. Mineral fertilizations improved soil OM quality
   by decreasing C : N ratio in the light OM fraction whereas manuring led
   to a decline of the C : N ratio in the total macro-OM fraction, with
   respect to nil treatment. Further fractionation of the total macro-OM
   according to density clarified that across treatments about 3/4 of total
   macro-OM was associated with minerals. Thus, by simultaneously applying
   particle-size and density separation procedures, we clearly demonstrated
   that the macro-OM differed from the light OM fraction not only in its
   chemical composition but also in associations with minerals. The
   proportion of the 0.50.25?mm water-stable aggregates of soil was higher
   under organic or inorganic fertilizations than under no manure or no
   mineral fertilization, and increases in OC and N concentrations of
   water-stable aggregates as affected by fertilization were greater for
   10.5 and 0.50.25?mm classes than for the other classes. Results indicate
   that OM stocks in different soil pools can be increased and the loose
   aggregation of these strongly eroded loess soils can be improved by
   organic or inorganic fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{Physical, chemical and biological attributes of soil surface are
   significantly affected by tillage practices and crop rotation. The
   objective of this study was to determine the short-term (2006-2009)
   effects of conventional and conservational tillage practices on selected
   soil physical properties of a heavy clay soil under two wheat-corn and
   wheat-legume rotation in a semi-arid Mediterranean Region. Treatments
   included conventional tillage with residue incorporated in soil (CT1),
   conventional tillage with burned residue (CT2), reduced tillage with
   heavy tandem disc-harrow (RT1), reduced tillage with rotary tiller
   (RT2), reduced tillage with heavy tandem disc harrow fallowed by
   no-tillage (RNT) and no tillage (NT). Disturbed and undisturbed soil
   samples were collected to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (HC), bulk density (BD), mean weight diameter (MWD), available water
   content (AWC) and total porosity at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths. The
   highest HC values of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths were obtained with CT1
   (9.70x10(-6) m s(-1), 8.74x10(-6) m s(-1)) and CT2 (9.39x10(-6) m s(-1),
   8.58x10(-6) m s(-1)) applications. CT2 treatment destructed the soil
   aggregates and resulted in greater bulk density and low total porosity
   at 0-10 cm depth. The available water content at 0-10 cm depth was
   significantly reduced with the CT1 (P<0.01) and CT2 applications
   (P<0.05). Although three years of no-tillage application in clay rich
   soils caused higher bulk density and low porosity, increase in MWD is an
   indication of soil and water conservation. Therefore, no till and
   reduced till applications should be adapted to the farmers' conditions
   for sustainability in agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Copper (Cu) is accumulating in agricultural soils because it is an
   essential component of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. This could
   lead to toxic effects on soil macro- and micro-organisms and impact soil
   structure development. We investigated the effect of historical Cu
   contamination (>80 years; from background concentrations up to 3837 mg
   Cu kg(-1)) on soil microbial enzyme activity, physical properties and
   resilience to compression. Soil samples and cores were taken from a
   fallow sandy loam field in Denmark. Microbial activity was quantified
   using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and dehydrogenase (DHA) assays. Water
   dispersible clay was measured on field moist and air dried samples. For
   the resilience assay, soil cores (drained to -100 hPa) were subjected to
   uniaxial confined compression (200 kPa) followed by wet-dry or
   freeze-thaw cycles. Microbial enzyme activity significantly decreased
   with Cu concentration greater than or similar to 500 mg kg(-1) with the
   two microbial assays linearly correlated with each other as well as with
   the water dispersible clay. An effect concentration causing a 50\%
   reduction (EC50) in enzyme activity was observed at 521 mg kg(-1) for
   FDA and 542 mg kg(-1) for DHA. Significant increases in water
   dispersible clay, bulk density and decreases in air-filled porosity and
   air permeability were observed from Cu greater than or similar to 900 mg
   kg(-1). The increased density of the contaminated soils led to greater
   compression resistance and resilience relative to the uncontaminated
   soil. The results suggest that a threshold level for Cu exists (similar
   to 500 mg kg(-1) for this soil type) beyond which microbial activity
   decreases and soil structure becomes more compact with reduced
   permeability to air. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of diffusive and convective gas transport parameters can be
   used to describe soil functional architecture and reveal key factors for
   soil structure development. Undisturbed 100-cm(3) soil samples were
   sampled at the Long-term Research on Agricultural Systems experiment
   located at the University of California, Davis. The 18 plots used in
   this study represented fairly wide ranges in organic carbon (0.
   0072-0.0153 kg kg(-1)) and clay (0.30-0.44 kg kg(-1)). Soil-air
   permeability, k(a), and soil-gas diffusivity, D-P/D-0, were determined
   at field-moist conditions (fin) and, subsequently, after saturation and
   drainage to - 100 cm of matric potential (pF2). Gas diffusivity in
   intact samples at fm conditions exhibited a general, linear relationship
   with air-filled porosity (epsilon), independent of soil texture and
   treatment. Comparing intact and repacked samples drained to pF2,
   repacked soil displayed markedly lower D-P/D-0 values at similar
   air-filled porosity, illustrating soil structure effects on D-P/D-0. The
   Currie tortuosity-connectivity parameter, X=Log(D-P/D-0)/Log(epsilon),
   decreased with increasing bulk density in the intact samples at both
   moisture conditions, suggesting less tortuous and well-connected
   pathways for gas diffusion at higher bulk density. Pore organization, PO
   = k(a) / epsilon, showed a treatment effect with typically higher values
   for the organic plots, implying that an improved possibility for
   formation of organomineral soil aggregates resulted in better-connected
   macropore networks. Fitting a linear model to D-P/D-0 versus epsilon
   measurements revealed different slopes at the two moisture conditions,
   suggesting short-term nonsingularity (hysteretic) effects after
   rewetting and drainage. Defining the ratio of slopes at the fin and pF2

Abstract = {{Biochar (BC) application to agricultural soils could potentially
   sequester recalcitrant C, increase N retention, increase water holding
   capacity, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biochar addition
   to soils can alter soil N cycling and in some cases decrease extractable
   mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) and N2O emissions. These benefits are not
   uniformly observed across varying soil types, N fertilization, and BC
   properties. To determine the effects of BC addition on N retention and
   GHG flux, we added two sizes (>250 and <250 mu m) of oak-derived BC
   (10\% w/w) to two soils (aridic Argiustoll and aquic Haplustoll) with
   and without N fertilizer and measured extractable NO3- and NH4+ and GHG
   efflux (N2O, CO2, and CH4) in a 123-d laboratory incubation. Biochar had
   no effect on NO3-, NH4+, or N2O in the unfertilized treatments of either
   soil. Biochar decreased cumulative extractable NO3- in N fertilized
   treatments by 8\% but had mixed effects on NH4+. Greenhouse gas efflux
   differed substantially between the two soils, but generally with N
   fertilizer BC addition decreased N2O 3 to 60\%, increased CO2 10 to
   21\%, and increased CH4 emissions 5 to 72\%. Soil pH and total treatment
   N (soil + fertilizer + BC) predicted soil N2O flux well across these two
   different soils. Expressed as CO2 equivalents, BC significantly reduced
   GHG emissions only in the N-fertilized silt loam by decreasing N2O flux.
   In unfertilized soils, CO2 was the dominant GHG component, and the
   direction of the flux was mediated by positive or negative BC effects on
   soil CO2 flux. On the basis of our data, the use of BC appears to be an
   effective management strategy to reduce N leaching and GHG emissions,
   particularly in neutral to acidic soils with high N content.}},

Abstract = {{Degraded sodic lands in north India are rehabilitated under agriculture
   and forest sector as per national policies. Afforestation on such lands
   with monoculture and mixed species reclaims the soils with different
   efficiencies. We studied the physico-chemical and microbial properties
   along with enzymatic activities of degraded sodic land (control),
   rehabilitated sodic lands planted under Terminalia arjuna (R-TA),
   Prosopis juliflora (R-PJ) and mixed forest (R-MF) from two depths (0-15
   and 15-30 cm). The properties of rehabilitated land uses were compared
   with the soils of corresponding reference (standard) land use under
   Tectona grandis (Ref-TG) plantation and mixed forest (Ref-MF) growing in
   the natural forest range of same biogeographic region to determine the
   status of improvement. The objective of the study was to determine
   efficient ecological model for the restoration of degraded sodic land.
   The bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable
   sodium percentage (ESP) reduced during restoration under both, pure
   plantations as well as mixed forest. Increase in water holding capacity
   (WHC), organic carbon, soil nutrients, microbial biomass (MB) {[}carbon,
   nitrogen and phosphorus], microbial counts, CO2 flux and enzymatic
   activities (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, protease and acidic
   phosphatase) showed significant improvement in the soil quality of
   rehabilitated sites. At 0-15 cm soil depth in rehabilitated and
   reference land uses, in comparison to D-SL, organic carbon, nitrogen
   (total and available), available phosphorus, exchangeable cations (Na+,
   Ca++ and Mg++), MB (carbon and nitrogen) and activities of all enzymes,
   except alkaline phosphatase, were significantly greater, while other
   soil properties showed land use specific trends. The overall gain
   percent in physico-chemical soil properties varied from 54\% under

Abstract = {{Soil surface porosity (SSP) is often a concern in agro-ecosystem. The
   technique of indirect determination of SSP using a laser scanner was
   proposed but an ideal index relating soil surface roughness (SSR) to SSP
   is still expected. This study presented an index based on
   two-dimensional Fourier Transform (2DFT). The field experiment was
   conducted at the Dikopshof Farm (6 degrees 57'17 `' E, 50 degrees 48'17
   `' N), Bonn, Germany, where soil textural composition (g g(-1)) was:
   sand 0.17, silt 0.67, clay 0.16, and organic matter content 0.019
   (silt-loam, USDA Standard), Because SSP is not only altered by specific
   cultivation, but also temporally affected by weather factors, this index
   was validated with the data laser-scanned from an agricultural field
   tilled by two types of cultivators and the rainfall data of two years.
   We found that the variations of soil surface elevation in large- or
   small-scale could be separated by the spectrum of 2DFT. Consequently,
   the defined index was sufficient to transform the measured SSR into SSP
   for these tillage treatments (0.893 <= R-2 <= 0.969) even though the
   rainfall data of the two years were different. More importantly, the
   laser scanning time was considerably reduced from about 40 min to 2.5

Abstract = {{Soil moisture has important implications for meteorology, climatology,
   hydrology, and agriculture. This has led to growing interest in
   development of in situ soil moisture monitoring networks. Measurement
   interpretation is severely limited without soil property data. In North
   Carolina, soil moisture has been monitored since 1999 as a routine
   parameter in the statewide Environment and Climate Observing Network
   (ECONet), but with little soils information available for ECONet sites.
   The objective of this paper is to provide soils data for ECONet
   development. The authors studied soil physical properties at 27 ECONet
   sites and generated a database with 13 soil physical parameters,
   including sand, silt, and clay contents; bulk density; total porosity;
   saturated hydraulic conductivity; air-dried water content; and water
   retention at six pressures. Soil properties were highly variable among
   individual ECONet sites {[}coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging from
   12\% to 80\%]. This wide range of properties suggests very different
   behavior among sites with respect to soil moisture. A principal
   component analysis indicated parameter groupings associated primarily
   with soil texture, bulk density, and air-dried water content accounted
   for 80\% of the total variance in the dataset. These results suggested
   that a few specific soil properties could be measured to provide an
   understanding of differences in sites with respect to major soil
   properties. The authors also illustrate how the measured soil properties
   have been used to develop new soil moisture products and data screening
   for the North Carolina ECONet. The methods, analysis, and results
   presented here have applications to North Carolina and for other regions
   with heterogeneous soils where soil moisture monitoring is valuable.}},

Abstract = {{Application of biochar has been suggested to improve water- and
   fertilizer-retaining capacity of agricultural soil. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the effects of bagasse charcoal (sugarcane
   {[}Saccharum officinarum L.] bagasse-derived biochar) on nitrate (NO3-)
   leaching from Shimajiri Maji soil, which has low waterand
   fertilizer-retaining capacity. The nitrate adsorption properties of
   bagasse charcoal formed at five pyrolysis temperatures (400-800 C) were
   investigated to select the most suitable bagasse charcoal for NO3-
   adsorption. Nitrate was able to adsorb onto the bagasse charcoal formed
   at pyrolysis temperatures of 700 to 800 degrees C. Nitrate adsorption by
   bagasse charcoal (formed at 800 degrees C) that passed through a 2-mm
   sieve was in a state of nonequilibrium even at 20 h after the addition
   of 20 mg N L-1 KNO3 solution. Measurements suggested that the saturated
   and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of bagasse charcoal (800 degrees
   C)-amended soils are affected by changes in soil tortuosity and porosity
   and the presence of meso-and micropores in the bagasse charcoal, which
   did not contribute to soil water transfer. In NO3- leaching studies
   using bagasse charcoal (800 degrees C)-amended soils with different
   charcoal contents (0-10\% {[}w/w]), the maximum concentration of NO3- in
   effl uents from bagasse charcoal-amended soil columns was approximately
   5\% less than that from a nonamended soil column because of NO3-
   adsorption by bagasse charcoal (800 degrees C). We conclude that
   application of bagasse charcoal (800 degrees C) to the soil will
   increase the residence time of NO3- in the root zone of crops and
   provide greater opportunity for crops to absorb NO3 (-).}},

Abstract = {{Biologically derived emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide
   (N2O) at 0 degrees C vary with soil depth during soil thawing.
   Micro-site soil properties, especially those which influence porosity
   and substrate availability, also vary with depth and may help explain
   gas emissions. Intact soil cores collected to a depth of 80 cm from an
   undisturbed prairie Mollisol in central North Dakota were uniformly
   subjected to distinct temperature steps during a simulated soil thaw
   (-15 to 5 degrees C) and sampled for CO2 and N2O emissions throughout
   the soil profile. Emission data were fit to a first order exponential
   equation (E = alpha e(beta T)). Cores were then analyzed in 10 cm depth
   increments for micro-site properties including root length and mass,
   aggregation, and organic substrate availability (available,
   aggregate-protected and mineral-bound pools). Both CO2 and N2O emissions
   at 0 degrees C declined exponentially with depth. Emissions of CO2 and
   N2O at 0 degrees C were strongly related to root length (R-2 = 0.80 and
   0.76, respectively), root mass (R-2 = 0.56 and 0.74), large
   macroaggregate mass (R-2 = 0.63 and 0.54), and aggregate-protected
   organic matter (R-2 > 0.57), while available organic matter was related
   to CO2 (R-2 > 0.60) and not N2O. When CO2 and N2O emissions were
   normalized by available and aggregate-protected carbon pools,
   respectively, nutrient use efficiency increased significantly with
   depth. Results suggest CO2 and N2O emissions are (1) positively
   influenced by the rhizosphere and (2) differentially affected by
   substrate pool or location. CO2 emissions were more positively affected
   by available substrate, while N2O emissions were more positively
   affected by less labile, aggregate-protected substrate. (C) 2012

   regimes on soil organic matter (SOM) in an irrigated maize-based (Zea
   mays L.) conservation agriculture (CA) system following four years of
   continuous practice. Separate plots of oat and grazing vetch cover crops
   were grown in winter and then maize was planted in all plots in the
   following summer season. The four fertilization regimes used were: (i)
   fertilizer applied to the cover crops and the maize crop (F1), (ii)
   fertilizer applied to cover crops only (F2), (iii) fertilizer applied to
   the maize crop only (F3) and (iv) no fertilizer applied (F4). Control
   plots (weedy fallows) were included and the treatments were laid out in
   a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soil samples
   from 0-5, 5-20 and 20-50 cm depths were analyzed for total SOM,
   particulate organic matter (POM) fractions, hot water soluble C (HWC)
   and C-associated with water stable macro- and micro-aggregates (WSAC).
   While total SOM was more concentrated in the 0-5 cm soil depth across
   treatments, a lack of maize fertilization (F2 and F4 regimes)
   significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the stratification ratio. Oat and
   grazing vetch rotations produced significantly higher (P < 0.05) fine
   POM, coarse POM and HWC than weedy fallow rotations at 0-5 and 5-20 cm.
   When fertilized, oat was better able to support SOM sequestration in
   water stable aggregates at 0-20 cm while grazing vetch was more
   effective at 20-50 cm. The F3 regime had similar SOM levels as the F2.
   When no fertilizer was applied (F4-regime), there were significant (P <
   0.01) reductions in biomass input and total SOM on the oat-maize and
   weedy fallow-maize rotations whereas the grazing vetch-maize rotation
   did not respond, both at 0-5 and 5-20 cm. The findings suggested that in
   the low fertilizer input CA system, targeting fertilizer to the winter
   cover crop as opposed to the maize crop could give similar SOM response,
   with less fertilizer invested and that grazing vetch cover crops may be
   better suited to low N input CA systems for SOM improvement. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study are to convert at laboratory scale
   agricultural residues into activated carbons (AC) with specific
   properties, to characterize them and to test them in adsorption reactor
   for tetracycline removal, a common antibiotic. Two new ACs were produced
   by direct activation with steam from beet pulp (BP-H2O) and peanut hulls
   (PH-H2O) in environmental friendly conditions. BP-H2O and PH-H2O present
   carbon content ranged between 78\% and 91\%, similar BET surface areas
   (821 and 829 m(2).g(-1) respectively) and pH(PZC) values (9.8). Their
   porosities are different: PH-H2O is mainly microporous (84\%) with 0.403
   cm(3).g(-1) of total porous volume, whereas BP-H2O develops a mesoporous
   volume of 0.361 cm(3).g-(1) representing 50\% of the total porous
   volume. Two other commercial granular AC carbons (GAC1 and GAC2) were
   also characterised and used for comparison. The adsorption study is
   conducted in batch reactors. Two parts can be observed from kinetic
   decay curves: a very fast concentration decrease during the first 12 h,
   followed by a slow adsorption. An optimal contact time of 120 h is also
   deduced from these curves. It is shown as well that adsorption decreases
   with an increase of pH, indicating that the form preferentially adsorbed
   is probably the zwitterion form of the tetracycline. From equilibrium
   isotherms data, two adsorption models have been used: Langmuir and
   Freundlich. Both of them lead to a very good description of the
   experimental data. Maximum adsorption capacities deduced from the
   Langmuir equation follow the sequence: GAC2 (817 mg.g(-1))>BP-H2O (288
   mg.g(-1))>GAC1 (133 mg.g(-1))>PH-H2O (28 mg.g(-1)). In real spring
   waters spiked with TC (tetracyclines), adsorption isotherms show that
   the maximum adsorption capacity of BP-H2O is slightly increased to 309
   mg.g(-1) while it is decreased by one third to 550 mg.g(-1) in the case
   of GAC2. This study demonstrates that the production of AC from
   agricultural residues, at lab-scale, is feasible and leads to genuine
   activated carbons with different intrinsic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of fungi to aggregation of soil is thought to be
   mediated via hyphal enmeshment of particles and increased adhesion
   between particles. The role of saprotrophic fungi in soil aggregation
   remains uncertain. This study explored the role of saprotrophic
   Trichocomaceae in water-stable aggregation of soil. Eighty-five isolates
   derived from agricultural and undisturbed Australian soils were
   identified by morphological and molecular (ITS1-5.85 rRNA-ITS2) methods.
   The formation and stabilisation of soil aggregates by each isolate
   either through increased adhesion between particles, mediated by
   extracellular materials, or enmeshment during hyphal growth, and the
   effects of nutrition on aggregation were examined. The creation of
   water-stable aggregates by Trichocomaceous fungi was uncommon and
   largely transient, whether measured by adhesive materials alone or
   growth of the fungus in soil. Water-stable aggregation by adhesion was
   increased significantly by only one isolate. The adhesive properties of
   extracellular materials produced by this isolate were affected by the
   source of carbon. When grown in soil only six isolates increased
   water-stable aggregation by more than 12\% after three weeks. When grown
   on compost (complex carbon) selected isolates were capable of forming
   water-stable aggregates although these aggregates were generally not
   persistent. Mean weight diameter peaked after three weeks and declined
   thereafter with increased period of fungal growth. The potential to
   create water-stable aggregates by adhesion or soil enmeshment was
   isolate specific: the potential varied within species and was unrelated
   to extensive hyphal growth in culture. Saprotrophic Trichocomaceae are
   capable of aggregate formation by physical enmeshment; however the
   aggregates formed are not stabilised beyond the short growth period of
   the fungi. Any increase in water-stable aggregation by Trichocomaceae as
   a group is likely to be transient. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of biological
   geotextiles on soil erosion and on the main physical (porosity,
   texture), chemical (soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN)) and
   biological (cellulose decomposition activity) properties of the topsoil.
   16 runoff plots were installed in Abaujszanto, NE Hungary, on a slope
   with 15\% gradient. The plots are in orchard, traditional and espalier
   vineyards. The lower half of 8 plots were covered by Jute, Borassus and
   Buriti geotextiles respectively, the other 8 plots served as control
   plots (uncovered). All the used geotextiles reduce soil loss. Higher
   runoff volume provides a better water retention efficiency of the
   geotextile. In the measurement period of 30 month no significant
   (p<0.05) changes could be identified in porosity, SOC, TN content and
   microbiological activity of the topsoil. Regarding the texture of the
   eroded soil the filtering effect of runoff seems to be important as the
   eroded sediment is enriched in fine (clay) fraction. Borassus mats were
   the most effective geotextiles against soil erosion followed by Jute.
   The upscaling and the extrapolation of these results are rather
   difficult because of the high variability of environmental factors.
   Further research is needed on the effect of the environmental conditions
   to be able to give a reliable assessment on the protecting effect of
   geotextiles under the conditions of a sub-humid climate.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorhizal fungi (AMF) produce a glycoprotein (glomalin)
   which play an important role in the maintenance of soil structure and
   fertility. On the other hand, it can be used to evaluate the impact of
   agricultural practices on soil quality across many land use systems. We
   assessed land use impact on glomalin related soil proteins (GRSPs), soil
   quality and aggregation in the humid forest zone in southern Cameroon.
   Forest, short fallow and field crop production soil samples were used to
   determine GRSPs, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water stable aggregate
   (WSA(1-2mm)). Results showed that GRSPs significantly decreased from the
   forest to fallow and the field crop production systems. The easily
   extractable GRSP (EEGRSP) was 30\% and 39\% less under fallow and field
   crop production respectively, relative to the forest soils. Similarly,
   total GRSP (TGRSP) was 17\% and 46\% less under fallow and field crop
   production respectively, relative to the forest soils. C, N, and organic
   matter (OM) did not change significantly within the land use systems.
   The WSA(1-2mm) was 20\% less under fallow, and 33\% less under field
   crop production relative to the forest system. However, AMF spores
   augmented from forest to fallow and field crop production system. There
   was a positive correlation between GRSPs (EEGRSP, TGRSP) and AM fungal
   spore density suggesting the possible implication of these fungi to the
   production of the GRSP in this zone. There was also a positive
   correlation between C, N and EEGRSP, suggesting the implication of GRSP
   in stocking soil C and N in this zone. Likewise, a positive correlation
   between OM and TGRSP was found meaning the implication of GRSPs to OM
   pools in the soil of this zone. WSA(1-2mm) was also correlated with
   TGRSP, C and OM, suggesting the possible coactions of GRSP, OM to the
   formation of WSA(1-2mm), and thereby promoting the build up of soil
   structure. These results highlight the view that GRSP can be used as an
   indicator of soil quality in this region and should be considered as a
   criteria when define agricultural management strategies. AM fungal and
   GRSP might be useful to monitor soil degradation in this zone. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In this study, we compared the effects of three pruning frequencies (3,4
   and 6 cuts yr(-1)) of Gliricidia sepium hedgerows on (i) the
   productivities of shoot residues and maize grain, and (ii) on chemical
   and physical properties of a kaolinitic soil. Productivities of
   gliricidia shoots (GSP) and maize grain (MGP) were evaluated from 2001
   to 2003. In 2004, soil samples were taken from the experimental plots at
   0-5 cm and 5-20 cm depths and analyzed for total and particulate organic
   C (TOC and POM-C), percent of water stable aggregates (WSA), aggregate
   mean weighed diameter and cation exchange capacity (CEC). An adjacent
   native forest and a sole maize field under conventional till were also
   sampled as reference areas. Increasing pruning frequency resulted in a
   reduction of GSP from 6 and 4 t ha(-1) y(-1), with 3 and 4 cuts yr(-1)
   respectively, to 1 t ha(-1) y(-1), with 6 cuts yr(-1). However, the 3
   cuts yr(-1) treatment significantly reduced MGP in about 40\% and 25\%,
   respectively in 2000 and 2001, compared to the other pruning treatments,
   likely due to an increased competition between the maize and gliricidia
   plants. The high input to the soil of gliricidia shoot biomass with 3 or
   4 cuts yr(-1) promoted an improvement in soil quality at the 0-5 cm soil
   layer characterized by an increase of 35\% in POM-C and 10\% in WSA, and
   a multivariate-based soil profile closer to that of the native forest,
   compared to the 6 cuts yr(-1) treatment. Our results indicate that 4

Abstract = {{To improve our understanding of how clay-organic carbon dynamics affect
   soil aggregate strength and physical resilience, we selected three
   nearby soils (MFC, Mixed Forage Cropping; MCC, Mixed Cash Cropping; CCC,
   Cereal Cash Cropping) with identical clay content and increasing
   contents of organic carbon (CCC<MCC<MFC). The objective was to assess
   the resistance and resilience of the three soils to compaction using air
   permeability (k(a)), void ratio (e) and air-filled porosity (E) as
   functional indicators and to characterise aggregate stability, strength
   and friability. Aggregate tensile strength measurements were done at
   -1000 hPa and in the air dried state. Soil cores were subjected to
   uniaxial confined compression (200 kPa) followed by a period of natural
   recovery and wet-dry or freeze-thaw cycles. The MFC soil displayed
   greater tensile strength, specific rupture energy and friability at both
   soil-water potentials than the MCC and CCC soils possibly due to higher
   biotic binding of soil particles by the greater organic carbon content.
   The water dispersible clay was negatively correlated with the level of
   clay saturation by organic carbon. The resistance of the soils to
   compaction, quantified by both the compression index and a proposed
   functional index, was significantly greater for the MFC soil compared to
   the other two soils. The change in compression index with initial void
   ratio was significantly less for the MFC than the other soils. Plastic
   reorganisation of the soil particles immediately after compaction, prior
   to removal of the load, was greatest for the high organic soil Physical
   resilience after natural recovery followed the organic carbon gradient

   greater resilience for all three indicators (k(a), e and epsilon).
   Resilience (k(a), and e) after freeze-thaw cycles was significantly
   lower for the CCC soil than the MFC and MCC soils. A significant

Abstract = {{Utilization of treated wastewater (TWW) for agriculture is a widely
   accepted practice in regions suffering from freshwater (FW) shortages.
   Soil aquifer treatment is often employed for wastewater purification in
   regions with sandy soil. Infiltration rates of water through the soil
   can decrease as a result organic matter (OM) accumulation and the
   consequential water repellency. We examined several infiltration regimes
   with the aim of achieving lower levels of OM accumulation, reduced water
   repellency and increased infiltration rate in the topsoil layer of the
   infiltration basin. OM accumulation in the topsoil layer was found to be
   the main factor adversely affecting soil permeability. In measurements
   performed in the infiltration basins of the Tel Aviv
   wastewater-purification facility over a 1-year period, infiltration
   rates were found to differ with season, being low in the winter and high
   in the summer. Similar observations were made on small model
   infiltration ponds established to simulate the large basins. Several
   water-application regimes were tested for enhancement of the
   infiltration rates. Rapid application of TWW was the most efficient
   method in terms of reducing OM accumulation and water repellency in the
   topsoil layer. Low-rate, and spraying of TWW over the soil using
   sprinklers produced the highest OM accumulation and consequently, higher
   water repellency. Low-rate, single outlet application-the conventional
   infiltration method employed in the commercial infiltration
   basins-exhibited moderate OM accumulation and water repellency. Neither
   water repellency nor OM accumulation were observed in the FW-application
   regime. Accumulation of OM originating from the percolating TWW, at the
   topsoil layer was identified as dominating infiltration rate at the
   infiltration basins. Reduction of OM content by the means proposed and
   evaluated in this experiment can drastically increase infiltration
   rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Land cover and agricultural management practices can significantly
   influence soil structure. However, little is known about how fertilizer
   applications and land cover affect soil hydrology and groundwater
   recharge over longtime periods. The objective of this study was to use
   stable water isotopes as environmental tracers to provide additional
   information required for better understanding of water flow and solute
   transport processes in the unsaturated zone influenced by land cover and
   type of fertilizer applications. Five lysimeters containing undisturbed
   soil monoliths from the same agricultural field site were investigated
   over a period of 5 yr. Liquid cattle slurry and solid animal manure were
   applied to the maize (Zea mays L.) and winter rye (Secale cereale L.)
   lysimeters. The grass-clover lysimeter was treated with mineral
   fertilizer. Quantitative influence of land cover and type of fertilizer
   application on water flow and solute transport was evaluated for all
   lysimeters using a modified version of HYDRUS-1D. The highest drainage
   was observed in the maize lysimeter treated with cattle slurry, and the
   lowest in the grass lysimeter treated with mineral fertilizer.
   Pronounced differences in water contents and estimated saturated
   hydraulic conductivities between the lysimeters were restricted to the
   upper 25 to 30 cm of the soil. In particular, the lysimeters treated
   with animal manure had higher porosities, indicating a higher content of
   organic matter. Main differences in discharge between the lysimeters
   were observed in spring and during the plant growth periods, indicating
   the importance of nonuniform, patchy infiltration patterns during snow
   melt and of root water uptake, respectively. Mean water flow velocities,
   transit times, and effective water contents were estimated from the
   stable water isotope data, providing evidence on the impact of land
   cover and type of fertilizer application. We found smaller mean transit
   times in the maize lysimeters and for soils with liquid cattle slurry
   applications. Simulations indicate that numerical modeling can reproduce
   the general trend of water flow and isotope transport. Despite
   differences in mean transit times, fitted dispersivities were all in the
   same range, suggesting similar soil structures in the five lysimeters.
   However, more data for calibration and more information about
   heterogeneous infiltration would be required to improve the model
   accuracy. In general, stable water isotopes clearly contributed an added
   value, elucidating differences in mean flow parameters between the
   lysimeters. Thus, they provided evidence of the impacts of land cover
   and fertilizer applications, which are not obvious from water balance
   and mean discharge rates alone.}},

Abstract = {{Bioassays for ecotoxicity testing for the same non-target soil organism
   are not currently available for contaminants that can be present in the

   modes (liquid, solid or gaseous phase, LPB, SPB and GPB, respectively)
   allowing the assessment of the embryotoxicity of chemicals or
   pluri-contaminated matrices on land snail eggs are presented. Eight
   pesticides commonly used in vineyards (based on 10 active ingredients:
   copper, sulfur, metiram-zinc + pyraclostrobin, cymoxanil + folpet +
   fosetyl-Aluminium, tebuconazole, glyphosate, glufosinate) were tested by
   LPB: all of them reduced egg hatching success at concentrations lower
   than those applied in the field. The SPB was developed with one
   artificial ISO substrate and seven natural soils: three non-contaminated
   agricultural soils (Agr1-3) and four metal-contaminated soils (Me1-4).
   The moisture content (from 40 to 60\% of the water holding capacity) in
   the natural soils did not influence the hatching success. Hatching
   success did not vary in the three agricultural soils suggesting the
   relative insensitivity of eggs to some soil properties. Among the two
   pesticides tested in SPB, Corail (R) (tebuconazole based-fungicide) was
   more toxic than Bypass (R) (glyphosate based-herbicide) to snail embryos
   with EC50 values of 1 and 219 mg kg(-1) respectively in a natural soil
   (Agr2). Both pesticides were less toxic when tested in the ISO substrate
   (EC50 of 7.8 and higher than 400 mg kg(-1), respectively for Corail (R)
   and Bypass (R)), highlighting the influence of the organic matter
   content (lower in soil Agr2) on the bioavailability and thus the
   toxicity of the chemicals. LPB showed that soluble compounds of the most
   toxic soil in SPB (Me4) did not affect embryos. Similarly, GPB did not
   reveal toxic volatile compounds from this soil. These bioassays are
   complementary and efficient tools for soil risk assessment. (c) 2011

   slightly decreased from 248 to 237 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil in GB
   treatment during 2 years. The surface (0-10 cm depth) had greater enzyme
   activities and WSA than sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples. WSA increased
   from 178 to 314 g kg(-1) in row crop areas while all other treatments
   had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth
   interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for beta-glucosidase and
   beta-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and
   beta-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly
   correlated with soil organic carbon content (r a parts per thousand yen
   0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and
   microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus
   improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also
   support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management
   practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are
   of great agricultural and ecological importance.}},

Abstract = {{Land abandonment might be an alternative management for restoring soil
   conditions and C from prolonged cultivation and agricultural practices.
   In the present study, the influence of 18-22 years of land abandonment
   on soil properties, C dynamics and microbial biomass was evaluated in
   closely situated wheat and alfalfa farmlands, and abandoned lands on
   calcareous soils, Central Iran.
   Soil properties of the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths from abandoned lands
   were compared to those from conventionally cultivated lands (i.e.,
   continuous wheat-fallow and alfalfa-wheat rotation) common in calcareous
   soils of Central Zagros Mountains.
   Soil bulk density in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers decreased
   significantly while total porosity increased significantly in abandoned
   lands. Generally, soil aggregate stability tended to increase within the
   abandoned fields owing to increased water-stable macro-aggregates. Soil
   organic C (OC) contents (g kg(-1)) and pools (Mg ha(-1)) in the 0-15 cm
   soil layer increased significantly in abandoned lands compared with
   cultivated lands, with no effect in the 15-30 cm soil layer after 18-22
   years of land abandonment, suggesting the restoration of C is pronounced
   in the upper 0-15 cm soil depth . The total C accumulation in abandoned
   lands was 7.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the entire sampling depth (0-30 cm) over
   the 18-22 years of land abandonment, which was 26\% greater relative to
   cultivated lands. Carbon mineralization (Cmin) followed a trend similar
   to organic C, whereas C turnover (Cmin/OC ratio) was slightly greater in
   wheat fields. However, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) did not vary
   considerably among the three land uses.
   In brief, improvements, albeit slowly, in soil properties of the top
   layer with the cessation of cultivation indicated that land abandonment
   may result in enhanced soil C sequestration, and would maintain
   fertility and productivity of the farmlands of semi-arid climates.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) belowground is important to
   current and future climate models as soils warm in northern latitudes.
   Currently, little is known about the sensitivity of microbial
   respiration to temperature changes at depths below 15 cm. We used
   whole-core (7.6 cm dia. x 90 cm) laboratory incubations to determine if
   temperature response quotients (Q(10)) for CO2 and N2O varied with depth
   for undisturbed prairie while plants were senescent and clipped at the
   surface. We collected intact soil cores from an undisturbed prairie in
   central North Dakota and uniformly subjected them to freezing (5 to -15
   degrees C) and thawing (-15 to 5 degrees C). We measured rates of CO2
   and N2O emissions at 5 degrees C temperature increments at 0, 15, 30,
   45, 60, and 75 cm depths. During freezing, active and sterilized core
   emissions occurred only between 0 and -10 degrees C. During thawing, a
   simple first-order exponential model, E = alpha e(beta T), fit observed
   CO2 and N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.91 and 0.99, respectively). Parameter
   estimates for beta were not significantly different across depths for
   CO2 and for N2O (Q(10) = 4.8 and 13.7, respectively). Parameter
   estimates for alpha (emissions when temperature is 0 degrees C)
   exponentially declined with depth for both gases for similar
   depth-response curves. Stepwise regressions of soil properties on alpha
   parameter estimates indicated emissions of CO2 and N2O at 0 degrees C
   during thawing were positively correlated (R-2 > 0.6) with soil
   porosity. Results indicate pedogenic properties associated with depth
   may not necessarily influence temperature response curves during thawing
   but will affect emissions at 0 degrees C for both CO2 and N2O. Published

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{149-165}},
Abstract = {{Agriculture production has to increase by 70\% within 2050 in order to
   keep pace with population growth and changing diets. However, this
   production increase will have to be achieved in a way that preserves the
   environment and reduces the vulnerability of agriculture to climate
   change. Agriculture will furthermore need to minimize the emissions of
   greenhouse gases, pesticides and plant nutrients like nitrogen and
   phosphorous to the environment. Organic agriculture, conventional
   agriculture and conservation agriculture can be considered as different
   approaches for dealing with these production and environmental
   challenges. This chapter discusses the production and environmental
   implications of these three different approaches for agricultural
   development. Conventional agriculture is characterised by ploughing and
   limited recycling of organic materials. Organic agriculture uses no
   pesticides and mineral fertiliser whereas conservation agriculture is
   characterized by zero tillage, use of mulch and crop rotations.
   The studies reviewed show that conventional agriculture and conservation
   agriculture have similar yield levels, but the yield levels in organic
   agriculture is in the order of 30-50\% lower than in these two systems.
   One important reason for lower productivity in organic agriculture is
   limited supply of plant nutrients as organic sources of plant nutrients
   only supply 30-35\% of the nitrogen taken up by crops. Conservation
   agriculture is furthermore more efficient in building soil organic
   matter than organic agriculture and conventional agriculture.
   Conservation agriculture has been found to sequester between 0.1 and 1 t
   C ha(-1) year(-1). Building soil organic matter content can be
   considered as a cornerstone in adaption to climate as this will increase
   soil water holding capacity. and reduce soil temperature. System studies
   have shown that nitrogen and greenhouse gas emission are less in
   conservation agriculture as compared to conventional and organic
   agriculture. The non-use of pesticides is the major environmental
   advantages of organic agriculture.
   It appears from this review that conservation agriculture is the
   approach that can best deliver on the production and environmental
   objectives of agriculture.}},

Journal = {{BRAGANTIA}},

Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{502-508}},
Abstract = {{Soil compaction in areas under no-tillage has been pointed as a problem
   faced by farmers, particularly in areas with clay soils. Compaction is
   mainly caused by machinery traffic when the adequate soil moisture is
   not respected. Straw on the soil surface, by creating a physical barrier
   between the wheel and the ground may be a factor to minimize compaction.
   Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   millet straw on soil surface in reducing compaction caused by the
   tractor wheels. The experiment consisted of four treatments of straw
   quantity on surface (without straw and 5, 10 and 15 Mg ha(-1)) and three
   straw managements (standing up, lying down and fragmented). After the
   tractor passage, penetration resistance, water content, density and
   total porosity of soil were evaluated on the area where the wheel passed
   over. Density and porosity were not affected by wheel traffic.
   Treatments with straw had higher water content and as a result less
   resistance. There was no significant difference on resistance and soil
   moisture among straw management treatments. For an equal soil water
   content, higher densities of straw resulted in lower penetration
   resistance, which indicates less compaction.}},

Abstract = {{Post-mining land created as a result of the deposition of the strippings
   from Konin Brown Coal Mine (Konin BCM) is being rehabilitated in
   accordance with principles of the target species concept developed by
   Bender. The rehabilitation technology realised in accordance with this
   concept is based on the enhancement of soil chemism and improvement of
   physical properties supporting the development of vegetation cover and
   stimulating biogeochemical processes. The basic soil-forming factor in
   this concept is the anthropogenic factor integrating the action of
   biotic and abiotic factors into a consistent, mutually supporting system
   of rehabilitation actions and activities whose aim is to transform,
   within the period of 10 years, this specific maternal material into
   soil. One of the forms of integration of the anthropogenic factor into
   the composition of the solid phase of the developing soils was the
   addition of brown coal dust - a by-product created in the production of
   briquettes. The usefulness of brow coal for fertilisation purposes stems
   from the composition of its organic matter as well as specific physical,
   physico-chemical and chemical properties. The objective of the research
   project was to determine the effect of the addition of brown coal on
   major physical and water properties of anthropogenic topsoil 18 years
   after application. The research object was situated on the experimental
   plot of the Department of Soil Science and Restoration established in
   1978 on post-mining land of Patnow Mine internal dumping ground. The
   experiment comprised two variants. Variant A control comprised the area
   on which, from 1978, the applied treatments were consistent with
   Bender's concept of target species. In the case of variant B, on an
   experimental area subjected to restoration treatments for 14 years,
   fertilisation with brown coal dust in the amount of 1000 t.ha(-1) was
   applied in 1992. The following four fertiliser combinations were
   employed in this variant: 0 NPK (1); 100 kg N, 80 kg K2O, 40 kg P2O5
   (2); 200 kg N, 80 kg K2O, 40 kg P2O5 (3); 300 kg N, 80 kg K2O, 40 kg
   P2O5 (4). In both experimental variants, winter cereals were cultivated.
   Straw and other plant residues were ploughed under every year.
   In 2010, soil samples of intact and broken structure (V=100 cm(3)) were
   collected from the topsoil of individual plots for laboratory
   exanimations. The following parameters were determined: total carbon and
   nitrogen, texture composition, solid phase density, soil density, total,
   drainage and differential porosity, hygroscopic moisture content,
   maximal hygroscopic capacity, filtration, soil water binding potentials,
   potential and effective useful retention. It was concluded, among
   others, that the selected major physical, chemical and water properties
   of the arable layer of the agriculturally rehabilitated soils in
   accordance with principles of the concept of target plants were at the
   typical level characteristic for cultivated soils of similar texture and
   total carbon content. The addition of brown coal to the top layer of
   soil developing from post-mining land caused: a decrease in the soil
   density as well as the density of its solid phase, increase of total
   porosity, increase in proportions of mezo- and micropores, enhancement
   in the value of hygroscopic moisture content as well as maximal
   hygroscopic capacity. In the examined soils, together with the increase
   of the applied nitrogen fertilizer doses, the content of total carbon as
   well as C:N ratio narrowed. This was probably due to a faster rate of
   organic matter mineralisation. Long-term nitrogen fertilisation
   comprising four combinations failed to affect diversification of the
   total nitrogen content. In the case of soils with the addition of brown
   coal, the availability of production water was extremely low. On the
   other hand, the content of water available for plants but bonded with
   strong forces was high.}},

Abstract = {{An important issue for soil conservation and waste disposal is the use
   of biosolids in agriculture and for land reclamation. Most biosolids
   contain valuable nutrients that could be used to improve soil fertility.
   The aim of this work was to establish the effects of the application of
   biosolids on some chemical, biological and physical properties in an
   Andisol from southern Chile. This study was carried out under farm
   conditions during the wheat (Triticum aestivum) growing cycle. Five land

   fertilisation (TAF) and applications equivalent to 30 ton biosolids/ha
   (TA30), 60 ton biosolids/ha (TA60) and 90 ton biosolids ha(-1) (TA90).
   The soil samples of both treatment and non-treatment groups were
   collected after the application of biosolids, after sowing and before
   the wheat harvest. The evaluated chemical soil parameters were modified
   by the application of biosolids. Base levels of organic carbon, pH and P
   increased. Biological activity measured by the evolution of C-CO2
   followed the sequence TA90>TA60>TA30>TAF>TAT. The physical properties
   evaluated, namely water infiltration rate, accumulated infiltration and

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{We hypothesize that biological diversification across ecological,
   spatial, and temporal scales maintains and regenerates the ecosystem
   services that provide critical inputs-such as maintenance of soil
   quality, nitrogen fixation, pollination, and pest control-to
   agriculture. Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming
   practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to
   agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for
   off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically
   diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we
   examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient
   management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and
   pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and
   reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate
   change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional
   farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially
   greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and
   water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and
   resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional
   monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds,
   diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services;
   however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be
   insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient
   pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to
   agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming
   systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support,
   diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop
   productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce
   far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more
   research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming
   systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single
   diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence
   multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and
   integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed
   agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and
   region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests.}},

   total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), total iron, nitrate,
   nitrite, chloride, calcium and heavy metals like copper, zinc, and lead.
   Most of these parameters indicated pollution but were below the World

   to 6.8 indicating toxic pollution, the turbidity values were between 1.6
   and 6.6 NTU, and the temperature ranged from 26.5 degrees C to 27.5
   degrees C. The concentrations of iron, nitrate, nitrite and calcium
   ranged from 0.9 to 1.4, 30 to 61, 0.7 to 0.9, and 17 to 122 mg/l,
   respectively. Out of heavy metals, zinc ranged between 3.3 and 5.4 mg/l

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) has long been recognized as an important
   indicator of soil productivity. The SOM refers to the organic fraction
   of the soil exclusive of undecayed plant and animal residues. It plays a
   crucial role in maintaining sustainability of cropping systems by
   improving soil physical (texture, structure, bulk density, and
   water-holding capacity), chemical (nutrient availability, cation
   exchange capacity, reduced aluminum toxicity, and allelopathy), and
   biological (nitrogen mineralization bacteria, dinitrogen fixation,
   mycorrhizae fungi, and microbial biomass) properties. The preservation
   of SOM is crucial to ensure long-term sustainability of agricultural
   ecosystems. Improvement/preservation of soil organic matter can be
   achieved by adopting appropriate soil and crop management practices.
   These practices include conservation tillage, crop rotation, use of
   organic manures, increasing cropping intensity, use of adequate rate of
   chemical fertilizers, incorporation of crop residues, liming acidic
   soils, and keeping land under pasture. Organic matter can adsorb heavy
   metals in the soils, which reduce toxicity of these metals to plants and
   reduce their escape to ground water. Similarly, SOM also adsorbs
   herbicides, which may inhibit contamination of surface and ground water.
   Furthermore, SOM also functions as a sink to organic carbon and
   mitigates carbon dioxide (CO2) gas escape to the environment. Globally,
   soil organic matter contains about three times as much carbon as found
   in the world's vegetation. Hence, organic matter plays a critical role
   in the global carbon balance that is thought to be the major factor
   affecting global warming. Overall, adequate amounts of soil organic
   matter maintain soil quality, preserve sustainability of cropping
   systems, and reduce environmental pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the native forest in the highlands of western Kenya has been
   converted to agricultural land in order to feed the growing population,
   and more land is being cleared. In tropical Africa, this land use change
   results in progressive soil degradation, as the period of cultivation
   increases. Both rates and variation in infiltration, soil carbon
   concentration and other soil parameters are influenced by management
   within agricultural systems, but they have rarely been well documented
   in East Africa. We constructed a chronosequence for an area of western
   Kenya, using two native forest sites and six fields that had been
   converted to agriculture for up to 119 yr.
   We assessed changes in infiltrability (the steady-state infiltration
   rate), bulk density, proportion of macro- and microaggregates in soil,
   soil C and N concentrations, as well as the isotopic signature of soil C
   (delta C-13), along the 119-yr chronosequence of conversion from natural
   forest to agriculture. Infiltration, soil C and N decreased within 40 yr
   after conversion, while bulk density increased. Median infiltration
   rates fell to about 15\% of the initial values in the forest, and C and
   N concentrations dropped to around 60\%, whilst the bulk density
   increased by 50\%. Despite high spatial variability, these parameters
   have correlated well with time since conversion and with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Soil physical properties are important indicators of the potential for
   agricultural production. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of
   long-term inputs of green manures on physical properties of a reddish
   paddy soil (Fe-Typic Hapli-Stagnic Anthrosols) under a double cropping
   system. The common cropping pattern before the study was early-late
   rice-fallow (winter). The field treatments included rice-rice-fallow
   (R-R-WF), rice-rice-rape (R-R-RP), rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch
   (R-R-MV), and rice-rice-ryegrass (R-R-RG). The rape, Chinese milk vetch
   and ryegrass were all incorporated as green manures 15 d before early
   rice transplanting during the following year. The soil bulk density in
   all green manure treatments was significantly reduced compared with the
   winter fallow treatment. Soil porosity with green manure applications
   was significantly higher than that under the winter fallow. The green
   manure treatments had higher 0.25-5 mm water stable aggregates and
   aggregates stabilities in the plow layer (0-15 cm depth) compared with
   the fallow treatment. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and normalized mean
   weight diameter (NMWD) of aggregates in the green manure treatment were
   larger than that with the winter fallow. Soil given green manure
   retained both a higher water holding capacity in the plow layer soil,
   and a larger volume of moisture at all matric potentials (-10, -33 and
   -100 kPa). We conclude that the management of double-rice fields in
   southern central China should be encouraged to use green manures along
   with chemical fertilizers to increase SOC content, improve soil physical
   properties and soil fertility.}},

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{509-515}},
Abstract = {{Particle size fractions, varying from 1.6 to 0.1 mm, were separated from
   samples of municipal solid waste (MSW) compost. Several physical and
   chemical parameters of the samples with different particle sizes were
   measured. The results indicated particle size fractionation changed the
   physical properties and chemical component distribution of compost. Bulk
   density of the compost increased as particle size decreased However,
   with the decrease of particle size there is a trend to decrease some
   soil parameters as pH, porosity, saturated water holding capacity,
   organic content, and Ca, Fe, Mg, and Mn contents. Higher organic content
   was found in fractions of diameter exceeding 0.4 mm, and total N content
   was higher (P<0.05) in fractions of diameter exceeding 0.8 mm than <0.8
   mm fractions. Phosphorus was mainly distributed in coarse fractions
   larger than 0.8 min, but K was concentrated in fine fractions of <0.8
   mm. Calcium, Fe, Mg, and Mn contents in fractions >0.8 mm were higher
   (P<0.05) than those in fractions < 0.4 mm and control. Heavy metal
   concentrations in individual particles have strong particle size
   dependence. Lead was largely contained in fractions <0.8 mm, 244\%
   higher than in >0.8 mm fractions. High Cu content was observed in the
   size range of 0.2-0.4 min and 0.8-0.4 mm, with the maximum of 1,317
   mg.kg(-1) in the range of 0.8-0.4 mm. Zinc concentration was found to be
   the lowest in the range of 1.6-0.8 mm as compared to other fractions and
   control. No significant differences in Cd content were found between
   each treatment and control. Chromium and Ni were associated with the
   <0.8 mm particles more than any other fractions, and their
   concentrations were 177\% and 140\% higher than other particle sizes
   obtained, respectively. Based on the physical and chemical properties of
   different compost fractions used in this experiment, it is observed that
   coarse compost particles larger than 0.8 mm have considerable potential
   in agricultural applications as soil amendments.}},

Journal = {{SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{167-176}},
Abstract = {{It is generally believed that plantations of Eucalyptus bring about a
   decrease in soil fertility. Soil physicochemical and microbiological
   properties were measured across a range of E. grandis plantation ages
   (1-10 years) in south-western China to determine whether and how
   eucalypt afforestation of agricultural land affected the soil fertility.
   The results indicate that afforestation with E. grandis caused changes
   in soil properties with soil depth, and the changes were dependent on
   the stand age. Soil bulk density decreased significantly, but
   water-holding capacity increased significantly with time. Soil organic
   matter content, C:N ratio, and soil microbial biomass C and N
   concentrations showed an initial phase of decline and then increased
   significantly over time in the upper soil layers of E. grandis
   plantations aged from 1 to 4 or 5 years. Soil pH in E. grandis
   plantations did not change significantly with stand age or soil layer.
   Cation exchange capacity in the upper soil layer of E. grandis
   plantations increased significantly over time. Total exchangeable bases
   and base saturation in the soil decreased significantly with depth and
   with increasing plantation age. Furthermore, E. grandis afforestation of
   arable soils had no significant effects on total N, total P, and
   available P contents. The requirements of the trees, understory
   microenvironmental conditions, and allelopathic effects might play
   important roles in the dynamic changes of soil physicochemical and
   microbiological properties. The results demonstrate the progressive
   development of processes that lead to the restoration of soil fertility
   following E. grandis afforestation of arable soils. However, most of the
   properties measured for the afforested soils resembled the properties of
   arable soils and did not resemble those of the soil of control forests.
   Thus, reversion of soil properties in the study plantations is likely to
   require a considerable period of time. Long-term research is needed to
   understand changes in the soil properties resulting from afforestation
   with Eucalyptus and to predict future trends.}},

Abstract = {{In the province of Entre Rios (Argentina), land-use changes have been
   noticeable in recent years, because the portion of land devoted to
   pasture decreased whereas the proportion and length of crops in the
   rotation increased. We evaluated soil-use intensity effects on selected

   rotation experiment located in Entre Rios. Treatments included (1)
   continuous cropping, (2) crop-pasture rotation, (3) pasture, and (4)

   analyzed for chemical (pH, carbon and nitrogen contents, extractable
   phosphorus, cation exchange capacity) and physical (aggregate stability,
   percolation index, bulk density, pore-size distribution, and specific
   surface area) properties. Clearing of the native vegetation resulted in
   a significant reduction of soil organic carbon content and losses of
   structure stability and soil porosity. No differences were seen in
   cation exchange capacity between native forest and cultivated land,
   whereas specific surface area increased with decreased levels of organic
   carbon content following agricultural use. Although the studied soil

   doses of PBSW (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 m(3) ha(-1)), farmyard
   manure (FYM) + recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), and FYM + gypsum at
   50\% gypsum requirement (GR) + RDF] with three replications. The FYM
   dose was 5 Mg ha(-1). The experimental soil was sodic calcareous, being
   of the Sawargaon series of isohyperthermic family of Vertic haplustepts
   with high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), low available nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P), and high available potassium (K). The results
   revealed that the physical properties {[}bulk density, mean weight
   diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates, and hydraulic conductivity]
   of soil were improved in both layers of sodic soil (0-30 and 30-60 cm)
   as a result of the addition of increased doses of PBSW. The significant
   reduction in pH, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), ESP and increase in organic
   carbon, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and electrical conductivity (EC)
   were observed in both soil layers as a result of the addition of PBSW at

   PBSW (30 to 90 m(3) ha(-1)). The microbial populations {[}bacteria,
   fungi, actinomycetes, azotobacter, and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria]
   increased with an increase in the levels of application of PBSW.
   However, it was maximum in FYM + GR + RDF treatment, and it showed an
   overall increase up to the flowering stage and thereafter reduced at
   harvest. The soil basal respiration as mg carbon dioxide (CO2) increased
   with the increase in levels of PBSW application but it was the greatest
   in the FYM + gypsum + RDF treatment. Among the PBSW treatments, the
   greatest activities of soil enzymes (urease, dehydrogenase, and acid
   phosphatase) under the treatment of 180 m(3) ha(-1) PBSW were observed
   at the flowering stage. The available N, P, and K after harvest of
   sunflower crop were significantly greater in the PBSW treatment applied
   at 180 m(3) ha(-1); however, N, P, and K uptake and yield of sunflower
   were significantly greater in FYM + RDF + gypsum treatment followed by

Abstract = {{Soil aggregate character is a crucial soil property affecting soil
   stability and crop production. It has been assumed that enhanced plant
   growth and reduced soil erodibility following the application of gel
   polymers results from increased soil macro-aggregate content and
   stability. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of gel
   polymer on soil aggregates following the application of different N
   fertilizers. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of a
   gel polymer application, named sodium polyacrylate (PAAS), with
   different N-fertilizers on soil aggregate size distribution and
   stability of three typical soils (aeolian sandy soil, loessial soil and
   Lou soil) on loess plateau in China. PAAS was used at 4 concentrations
   of 0, 0.8, 2 and 5 g kg(-1)soil and five different N fertilizer
   treatments were applied as none, urea, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium
   nitrate and ammonium sulphate. A concentration of N 260 mg kg(-1) was
   added into the soil of all N fertilizer treatments. The dry and
   water-stable aggregate size distributions were determined by dry-sieving
   and wet-sieving methods, respectively. Mass fractal dimension (Dm) was
   used to characterize soil aggregate-size distributions. The results
   showed that with increase in PAAS content > 0.25 mm soil aggregates
   (R-0.25), mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD)
   were all significantly increased while aggregate deterioration rate (AD)
   and Dm were reduced. The effect of N fertilizer on soil aggregates was
   not obvious, however, each of them reduced the effect of PAAS on
   improving soil aggregate stability and urea effect was least. The
   results could provide efficient information to improve soil aggregate
   stability and enhance crop planting and reduce soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Various anionic polyacrylamide polymers (PAMs) are frequently used
   to improve soil properties and reduce erosion. However, the effects of
   their application on plant growth remain unclear.
   Methods Aggregate-free loess with high water holding capacity was used
   as growing substrate to test the effects of two rates (10 and 40 kg
   ha(-1)) of a linear PAM on the growth of maize (Zea maize L.) for a
   period up to one month. The PAM effects were evaluated at three levels
   of soil water content (SWC) and three plant ages, based on water
   consumption, shoot and root biomass, as well as allocation of recently
   assimilated C in plants and soil using C-14 labeling.
   Results Both SWC and maize age significantly affected water consumption,
   biomass accumulation, and C-14 allocation in plant parts and soil. Even
   though consistent increases in plant biomass and total assimilated C-14
   were observed, the effects of PAM application were insignificant on
   either of these variables.
   Conclusions The effects of PAM application were directly connected to
   soil rather than to maize, and could be masked by the non-structural
   loess. The effects tended to be age and soil-moisture specific, and were
   modulated by the rhizodeposition processes. The possible mechanisms of

Abstract = {{Laboratory incubation experiments in addition to physicochemical
   analyses of volcanic ash soils were carried out in order to identify
   biogeochemical factors related with soil organic C (SOC) stabilization
   in the long term and with the potential for C sequestration of
   agroecosystems. Up to 24 vineyard plots under similar subtropical
   conditions in Tenerife Island (Spain) were sampled. Soil samples were
   incubated for 30 days in laboratory conditions (27 degrees C and 66\%
   water holding capacity) and the CO(2) released was periodically measured
   to plot C mineralization curves. Soil organic matter (SOM) with special
   emphasis paid on the humic acid (HA) was characterized by elemental
   composition, spectroscopic techniques: visible, infrared (IR) and (13)C
   nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR) and analytical pyrolysis gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The dependent variables
   examined were either the total mineralization coefficient (TMC, g C . kg
   C soil(-1) day(-1)) in laboratory incubations, or the SOC. A very
   significant negative correlation was found between SOC and TMC, i.e., in
   our soils, the higher the biodegradation rates under laboratory
   conditions, the lower the soil C sequestered in the corresponding plots.
   In it was also observed that the concentration of amorphous minerals
   (Al(o) + 1/2 Fe(o) index) and the water holding capacity at 0.033 MPa
   were associated with lower CO(2) release; the latter could suggest
   microanaerobic conditions hampering biodegradation in these thixotropic
   soils. Conversely, no correlation was found between SOC or TMC and
   typical soil physical and chemical factors, such as granulometric
   fractions or exchangeable calcium. The molecular characteristics of the
   HAs showed also predictive potential as regards SOC resilience,
   reflecting the comparatively fast biodegradation of SOM composed mainly
   of biomass constituents (prominent lignin signature and O-alkyl (13)C
   NMR region). The poor correlation between total aromaticity of the HAs
   and SOM resistance against biodegradation could be explained by a dual
   origin of aromatic structures in HAs, either consisting of
   methoxyl-containing non-decomposed lignin structures or condensed black
   carbon-like polyaromatic structures. The results suggested the
   possibility of predicting the vulnerability of SOC to biodegradation
   from laboratory incubation experiments, which results of interest for
   modeling global change scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of industrial residues from fruit processing in agriculture can

   irrigated orchard of guava trees (cv. Paluma) seven years old on a
   Red-Yellow Ultissol. The experimental design was randomized block and
   split plot with five treatments (doses: 0, 9, 18, 27 and 36 Mg ha(-1) of
   residue) and two soil layers (0.00 to 0.10 and 0. 10 to 0.20 m). It was
   evaluated the same type of soil on a native forest adjacent to the
   experimental area. It was analyzed the size distribution of water stable
   aggregates, the average diameter, the geometric mean diameter,
   aggregates larger than 2 mm and SOC. Data were subjected to analysis of
   variance (F test) following a randomized complete block design with
   split-plot (5 x 2 layers). The treatment means were compared by Tukey
   test at 5\% probability and the average of the layers were compared by F
   test at 5\% probability. The data collected in the forest soil were used
   only as a reference soil in natural state and therefore were not
   considered as a factor of variation in the analysis of variance. The
   values of aggregation index with the soil organic carbon stock were
   subjected to Pearson correlation (p <= 0.05). The effect of residual
   doses of guava seeds on the soil organic carbon from 0.00 to 0.20 m of
   soil layer was evaluated by regression analysis. The treatments did not
   differ in relation to soil aggregation; however, SOC was directly
   related to the amount of residues applied to the soil. There was
   significant positive correlation between aggregation index and SOC. The

Abstract = {{In the Three Gorges Area of China, soil erosion and the resultant
   non-point source pollution and ecological degradation have endangered
   agricultural ecosystems and fresh water reservoirs. Although efforts
   have been undertaken to reduce soil and water losses from slope land
   used for citrus production, information on the effects of management
   practices on soil fertility indices is either limited or nonexistent.
   This study was conducted to compare the effects of 10 years of various
   management practices, citrus intercropped with white clover (WC), citrus
   mulched with straw (SM), citrus intercropped with contour hedgerows
   (CH), citrus orchard land with impermeable membrane (IM), and citrus
   intercropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum) and peanut (Arachris
   hypogaea) (WP), as treatments on soil fertility indices with that of the
   conventional citrus management (CM). Results showed that the soil
   organic carbon, total and available nitrogen, available potassium, and
   water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at the 0-5 cm depth were
   higher for the WC and SM treatments than the CM treatment. There was
   also spatial variation in soil fertility along slopes of the WC and SM
   treatments. The soil total and available nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   potassium, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at both the
   0-5 and 5-20 cm depths were higher for the CH and IM treatments than the
   CM treatment. The average soil available nitrogen and available
   potassium contents were higher for the WP treatment than the CM
   treatment, but the WP treatment had little effect on the soil organic
   carbon, total nitrogen, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents.
   These suggested that white clover intercropping and straw mulching were
   the most effective approaches to improve soil fertility in citrus

Abstract = {{Intra- and interannual variability of precipitation can lead to major
   modifications of grassland production and carbon storage capacity.
   Greater understanding of how climatic variability affects net CO2
   exchange {[}i.e. net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] of grazed grasslands is
   important to adapt grassland management and reduce risks of carbon
   losses. Since 2002, we continuously measured NEE (i.e. eddy covariance
   technique) on an upland grassland site (7 ha), divided in two paddocks
   grazed by heifers (intensive: 1 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), 213 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1) and extensive: 0.5 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), no fertilization). For
   years with dry and warm growing seasons (i.e. 2003, 2005 and 2008),
   absolute annual NEE was higher in the intensive paddock compared with
   the extensive paddock. The opposite was observed during years of ample
   seasonal rainfall and soil moisture (i.e. 2004, 2006 and 2007).
   Contrasted management led to two distinct plant communities being
   different in leaf area index (LAI), soil bulk density and soil water
   holding capacity. Differences in annual NEEs could thus be assigned to
   interactions between in carbon and water fluxes during dry and wet
   growth periods. Dry growth periods led to a reduction in weekly gross
   primary productivity (GPP) in the extensively managed paddock, whereas
   the GPP was maintained in the intensive paddock. In turn, during wet
   growth periods, GPP was similar in both paddocks, whereas N amendment
   and frequent defoliation significantly increased ecosystem respiration
   in the intensive paddock, presumably through a higher heterotrophic
   respiration following on a better C substrate quality and availability
   (rhizodeposition and senescent fine roots). In the extensive paddock,
   where plant cover was denser (reducing soil temperature) and less
   decomposable, C losses through heterotrophic respiration were
   comparatively smaller under wet conditions. Our results demonstrate that
   grassland subjected to a moderately intensive management could be more
   resilient in terms of carbon storage during drought and heat waves,
   presumably because of a trade-off between heterotrophic and autotrophic
   respiration.}},

Abstract = {{Windrow-composted livestock manure has been shown to be less hazardous
   to the environment compared to manure directly applied to cropland and
   other agricultural areas. Although offsite contaminant losses through
   runoff and leaching can occur during the composting process, these
   losses are suspected to increase under different compost moisture
   conditions and as composted materials mature. This research quantified
   the effects of windrow-composted livestock manure and straw bedding
   components on runoff and infiltration characteristics from laboratory
   rainfall simulations. Compost samples collected on three dates at
   approximately the beginning (day 0), middle (day 30), and end (day 60)
   of a June-July 2004 field research windrow composting period were used
   for this rainfall simulation study. Replicated compost windrow-shaped
   cross-section samples were constructed in a specially-designed Plexiglas
   container apparatus for viewing and recording infiltrated leachate
   wetting front position boundary movement from simulated rainfall events.
   Runoff and leachate samples were collected and analyzed for drainage
   volumes and concentrations and total mass losses of sediment,
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)-N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO(4)-P) during and
   following rainfall simulation trials. Leachate wetting front position
   boundary movement was significantly lower for day 60 compost samples
   compared among day 0 and day 30 compost sample material. Drainage volume
   analysis results indicated significantly higher average runoff versus
   leachate volumes within all compost sampling dates, and runoff volumes
   were significantly higher among day 30 and day 60 compost samples
   compared to runoff volumes from day 0 compost samples. Average sediment,
   NO(3)-N, and PO(4)-P concentrations were significantly higher in
   leachate versus runoff within all compost sampling dates. Conversely,
   the total mass losses of these contaminants were significantly higher in
   runoff compared to leachate within all compost sampling dates. Results
   of this study suggest that biological and mechanical functions of the
   composting process reduced compost sample aggregates and increased
   compost bulk density. We hypothesize that these changes in compost
   material structure and porosity volume decreased infiltration and
   increased runoff sediment, NO(3)-N, and PO(4)-P losses during the second
   and final compost sampling stages of a field windrow composting period.}},

Abstract = {{Due to water scarcity, the agricultural production in arid areas is
   dependent on a sustainable irrigation management. In order to optimize
   irrigation systems, the application of superabsorbent polymers (SAP) as
   soil amendments, frequently studied within the last years, may be an
   appropriate measure to enhance the water holding capacity and the
   plant-available water in poor arable soils. These persistent polymers
   are also able to reduce heavy metal and salt stress to crops by
   accumulating those inorganic compounds. However, the impact of SAP on
   fate and behavior of organic xenobiotics in soil is unknown. Therefore,
   transformation and sorption of the model substance C-14-imazalil were
   monitored without and with SAP amendment in silty sand and sand soil
   under laboratory conditions.
   Within the 100-d incubation period, the transformation of C-14-imazalil
   was not substantially affected by the SAP amendment even though the
   microbial activity increased considerably. In the silty sand soil,
   extractable residues dropped from 90\% to 45\% without and from 96\% to
   46\% with SAP amendment. Non-extractable residues continuously increased
   up to 49\% and 35\% while mineralization reached 6\% and 5\%,
   respectively. In the sand soil, characterized by its lower microbial
   activity and lower organic carbon content, extractable residues merely
   dropped from 99\% to 81\% and from 100\% to 85\% while non-extractable
   residues increased from 2\% to 14\% and 1\% to 10\%, respectively.
   Mineralization was lower than 2\%. The increased microbial activity,
   usually promoting transformation processes of xenobiotics, was
   compensated by the enhanced sorption in the amended soils revealed by
   the increase of soil/water distribution coefficients (K-d) of 26 to 42 L
   kg(-1) for the silty sand and 6 to 25 L kg(-1) for the sand,

   samples (rings) to determine bulk density (Ds) and soil porosity.
   Results indicated that the land use and management systems induced

   This was inferred from the higher values of soil Ds, maximum bulk

Abstract = {{The imposition of agricultural systems changes the natural equilibrium
   of the soil to an extent that it becomes dependant on management
   practices and soil resilience. Agroforestry systems (AFs) mimic
   characteristics of natural ecosystems such as multistrata canopy and
   deep rooting and may minimize the consequences of these changes by
   providing soil protection and maintenance of conditions similar to those
   under natural vegetation. This study evaluates the physical properties
   of a Luvisol at a site where since 1997 alternative agro-forestry
   systems (AFs) (agrosilvipasture-AGP and silvipasture-SILV), conventional
   crop management (CCM) and natural vegetation (NV) have been maintained.
   Undisturbed soil cores were collected in 2005 and submitted to a range
   of matric suction for which soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration
   resistance (Q) and soil water content (theta) were determined. Water
   retention and penetration resistance were used to determine the least
   limiting water range (LLWR) and the slope of the soil water retention
   curve at its inflection point (S-value). Particle size, total organic
   carbon (TOC) and particle density were determined using the disturbed
   soil samples. Water retention and porosity followed the sequence
   NV>SILV>CCM>AGP. The AFs studied (AGP and SILV) improved or maintained
   soil physical quality when compared to NV with no significant
   differences between the S-values of 0.044, 0.042 and 0.050,
   respectively. However, the S-value of 0.035 for CCM indicates that this
   management was unable to maintain soil physical quality on the same
   levels as AFs and NV. The decrease of LLWR with BD occurred for all
   treatments, and the BD at a maximum effect (LLWR=0) which is called the
   critical BD (BD(c)), was, respectively, 1.69, 1.62, 1.56 and 1.56 Mg
   m(-3) for AGP, SILV, NV and CCM. The larger values of LLWR for AFs (AGP
   and SILV) are similar to the value for NV, with associated superior
   aeration, matric suction and reduced resistance to penetration by roots.
   Indices such as LLWR and S-value were suitably sensitive and could be
   used in future research, but it is important to identify other potential
   indices for these situations that can show how quickly changes in soil
   quality may occur. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil aggregation is important for the resistance of land surfaces to
   erosion, and it influences the ability of soils to remain productive. At
   the same time, it is also an important process of carbon sequestration.
   The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effects of different
   land use patterns on soil aggregate stability and the distribution of
   organic carbon in different aggregate fractions in order to prove that
   the different land use patterns enhance soil aggregate stability. Five
   kinds of soil samples were collected from the hilly area of western
   Sichuan under different land use patterns, such as abandoned farmlands,
   eucalyptus plantations, Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and
   loquat orchards. The results demonstrated that the five land use
   patterns had high proportions of aggregates at the size of > 2 mm after
   dry sieving, and had high proportions of aggregates at the size of < 0.5
   mm after wet sieving. The aggregation abilities of the soils were
   significantly different depending on land use patterns. Water-stable
   aggregate stability was highest in the Chinese fir plantations, followed
   by eucalyptus plantations and tea plantations. Water-stable aggregate
   stability was the lowest in loquat orchards and abandoned farmlands.
   Except for coarse particle, soil particle contents of the same size were
   affected according to the different land use patterns. As the size of
   aggregates decreased, the organic carbon content of the soil aggregates
   in tea plantations increased after a decrease, and then reduced again.
   However, the organic carbon contents of soil aggregates in other land
   uses increased continuously with the decreasing size of aggregates.
   Organic carbon content of the soil aggregates was strongly increased in
   land areas that had been converted from abandoned farmland to Chinese
   fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards, while it was
   decreased when abandoned farmland was converted to eucalyptus
   plantations. The results provided the basis of implementation of
   returning farmland to forest and the process of carbon sequestration in

Abstract = {{Agricultural activity has direct consequences on the soil and water
   quality. Thus, assessing environmental impacts of this vital economic
   activity, through soil attribute analysis, is essential to the proposal
   of alternatives. The aim of this study was to analyze soil quality under
   different land management practices, conventional and organic. The study
   was carried out in a watershed of the Ibiuna municipality, SP, Brazil,
   an important supplier of agricultural products for the sao Paulo
   metropolitan area. A hundred samples were collected, 20 in each type of
   land use: reforested areas, native vegetation, pasture, conventional
   cultivation and organic cultivation. The soil resistance to penetration,
   its pH (in water and KO), electrical conductivity, bulk density,
   particle density, porosity, soil color, soil texture and the percentages
   of carbon and nitrogen were analyzed. The data were statistically
   analyzed, searching for significant differences. The results of soil
   analysis showed great similarity between the organic and conventional
   culture, with no statistical differences. However, organic cultivation
   showed greater similarity to the soil of native vegetation in the
   percentage of carbon and nitrogen in soils compared to conventional
   culture. Thus, the discussion begins on a topic very little explored so
   far, and the results obtained should be further studied.}},

Title = {{Nitrogen fertilization but not soil tillage affects nitrous oxide

Abstract = {{Conversion of agricultural systems from conventional to no tillage
   practices usually increases soil carbon storage. However, adoption of no
   tillage may increase emissions of N(2)O, a very potent greenhouse gas.
   The objective of the study was to determine the effects of tillage
   (mouldboard plough {[}MP] and no-tillage {[}NT]) and three mineral N
   application rates (0,80 and 160 kg N ha(-1)) on annual and biennial
   (2004-2005) N(2)O fluxes. The experiment was organized using a
   split-plot design using tillage as the main plots and fertilizer rates
   as the sub-plot. The site was an artificially drained and therefore well
   structured humic gleysol near Montreal QC, on a maize (Zea mays
   L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Emissions (April-November) ranged
   from 1.0 to 2.5 kg N(2)O-N ha(-1). Throughout both years tillage had no
   effect (P > 0.05) on N(2)O emissions. During 2004, under maize
   cultivation, N(2)O emissions increased with the N fertilization rate (P
   < 0.001). Between 0.9 and 1.3\% of applied fertilizer N was lost as
   N(2)O-N, similar to the IPCC estimate of 1\%. There was also no
   significant interaction between tillage and N fertilization rate on
   N(2)O emissions during either year (P = 0.79). During the second year,
   under soybean cultivation, no N fertilizer was applied. As N(2)O
   emissions from the different fertilizer treatments were similar (P =
   0.99), we concluded that there was no carry-over effect of the
   fertilization applied to maize in the previous year. Yield-based N(2)O
   emissions were similar between the different tillage types (P = 0.63 and
   0.12 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and fertilization rates (P = 0.30
   and 0.84 for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and ranged from 17.0 to 22.7 g
   N(2)O-N kg(-1) N export in 2004 and 6.6 to 12.8 g N(2)O-N kg(-1) N
   export in 2005. Overall our results indicate that for this well-drained
   soil: (i) N fertilizer applications increased N(2)O emissions,
   supporting the use of IPCC-type emission factors; and (ii) soil tillage
   and the tillage-fertilization interaction had no measurable effect,
   consistent with previous reports that tillage of well-aerated
   agricultural soils has little effect on N(2)O emissions. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{The cocomposting of agricultural waste is a new management priority in

   respectively). Composts CI and CII were composed of AS/SB and OH/SB,
   respectively, at a ratio of 75/25 (wet weight basis). CHI consisted of
   OH, SB and CAS (coarsely-ground almond shell used as a bulking agent) at
   a ratio of 55/25/20. Finally, CIII was composed of
   25\%SB+9\%CAS+18\%GW+48\%WW. The composts studied were characterized by
   basic pH and an electric conductivity (EC) value ranging from 1.6 to 2.4
   mS/cm. The organic matter contents (OM) and C/N ratios of composts
   ranged from 20 to 46\% and from 10 to 21\%, respectively. Based on
   hydrophysical analyses, composts CI, CBI and CIV, containing AS, were
   shown to have a porosity and a water content of 10-26\% and 10-20\%,
   respectively. The phytotoxicity of composts was studied on the basis of
   cress seed germination. Results revealed that differences in properties

Abstract = {{Low soil organic carbon (SOC) levels in dry areas can affect soil
   functions and may thus indicate soil degradation. This study assesses
   the significance of SOC content in Mediterranean arable soils based on
   the analysis of a broad data set of 2613 soils sampled from
   Mediterranean grasslands and agricultural land. The distribution in
   values of SOC, pH, clay and carbonates was analysed according to
   different climatic areas (semi-arid, Mediterranean temperate,
   Mediterranean continental and Atlantic) and with respect to six
   different land uses (grassland, cereal crops, olives and nuts,
   vineyards, fruit trees and vegetable gardens). The general trend was for
   low SOC in arable land and decreased with aridity. In wet areas
   (Atlantic and Mediterranean continental), acidic soils had a higher SOC
   content than did calcareous soils, whereas in the Mediterranean
   temperate area SOC had little relationship to soil pH. In low SOC arable
   soils, the SOC content was related to clay content. In calcareous arable
   soils of the Mediterranean temperate zone, SOC content was more closely
   related to carbonates than to clay. In contrast to the Atlantic area,
   Mediterranean grassland soils had much lower amounts of SOC than forest
   soils. Mediterranean calcareous and temperate acidic soils under
   grassland had SOC-to-clay ratios similar to or only slightly greater
   than that under a crop regime. In contrast, Mediterranean continental
   acidic soils under grassland had a much higher SOC-to-clay ratio than
   arable soils. This suggests a low resilience of the Mediterranean
   temperate and calcareous arable soils in terms of SOC recovery after the
   secession of ploughing, which may be a result of intensive use of these
   soils over many centuries. Consequently, we hypothesize that the
   Mediterranean calcareous soils have undergone significant changes that
   are not readily reversed after ploughing ceases. Such changes may be
   related to alterations in soil aggregation and porosity which, in turn,
   are associated with soil carbonate dynamics. Decarbonation processes
   (the depletion of active carbonates) may therefore be relevant to the
   reclamation of highly calcareous arable soils through fostering soil
   re-aggregation. The article concludes by discussing the suitability of
   zero tillage, manuring or the introduction of woody species to increase
   SOC in calcareous arable soils that are highly depleted of organic
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{The high input of mechanical energy in common agricultural practice can
   negatively affect soil structure. The impact of compaction (P) and
   rotovation (R) on soil pore characteristics was compared with those in
   soil from untreated reference (U) plots of a loamy sand soil receiving
   for 14 yr, either only mineral fertilizer (MF) or, in addition, animal
   manure (OF). Undisturbed soil cores were taken from two separate fields
   in consecutive years at an identical stage in the crop rotation. We
   measured soil organic carbon (OC), soil microbial biomass carbon (BC),
   and hot-water extractable carbon (C(hot)). Water retention, air
   permeability and gas diffusivity were determined at -100 hPa in both
   years and for a range of water potentials in one of the years. The
   continued addition of animal manure had increased OC, BC, and C(hot)
   compared with the soil receiving only mineral fertilizer. Soil under
   treatment OF had larger porosity than that from treatment MF. Treatment
   P eliminated this difference and significantly reduced the volume of
   macropores. This interaction between soil organic matter content and
   mechanical impact was also reflected in the gas diffusion data. Specific
   air permeability was mainly influenced by mechanical treatment.
   Modelling the diffusion data normalized to the inter-aggregate pore
   space showed no significant treatment effects on pore-connectivity,
   although there was a tendency of more water blockage in soil under
   treatment MF. More studies are needed to confirm this interpretation.
   Our studies indicate that organic manure increases soil porosity, but
   compaction reduces the related gas exchange effects to the level of
   compacted soils receiving mineral fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{Even over short time intervals, soil properties are subject to
   variation, especially in managed soils. The objective of this study was
   to assess the temporal changes of soil physical and hydraulic properties
   in strawberry fields cultivated under surface drip fertigation in
   Turucu, Brazil. Intact core samples were collected from the near surface
   soil layer of seedbeds to determine the total porosity (TP),
   macroporosity (MA), matrix porosity, bulk density (BD), available water
   capacity (AWC), field capacity, wilting point and Dexter's S index.
   Aggregate samples were collected from the arable layer to determine the
   aggregate size distribution and aggregate mean weight diameter. All
   samples were collected from 15 strawberry fields and at four different
   times during the 2007-2008 strawberry growing cycle. Although soil
   pore-solid relations are expected to adjust soon after seedbed
   construction, their variation was only evident after >13 weeks. Even
   though values of TP and MA decreased with time, and those of BD
   increased near the end of the growing cycle, all the soils maintained
   their capacity to support root activity as indicated by critical values
   of Dexter's index (S>0.03). The amount of relatively large aggregates
   (9.51-2.00 mm) and AWC increased towards the end of the strawberry
   cultivation cycle. With changes in soil structure improving soil
   physical quality, strawberry development benefitted. We showed that if
   farmers gradually increase the amount of water through fertigation to a
   maximum value occurring at the end of crop cycle instead of applying
   water at a constant rate, water and energy use efficiency in agriculture

   analyses of total and particulate organic matter carbon, cation exchange
   capacity, mean weigh diameter and percentage of water stable aggregates

   quantify microbial biomass (MB), fungi to bacteria ratio (F/B) and an
   indicator of bacterial stress (19:0cy/18:1 omega 7c), whereas microbial
   enzyme activity was determined by the hydrolysis of fluorescein

Abstract = {{The application of pyrogenic carbon, biochar, to agricultural soils is
   currently discussed as a win-win strategy to sequester carbon in soil,
   thus improving soil fertility and mitigate global warming. Our aim was
   to investigate if biochar may improve plant eco-physiological responses
   under sufficient water supply as well as moderate drought stress. A
   fully randomized greenhouse study was conducted with the pseudo-cereal
   Chenopodium quinoa Willd, using three levels of biochar addition (0, 100
   and 200 t ha(-1)) to a sandy soil and two water treatments (60\% and
   20\% of the water holding capacity of the control), investigating
   growth, water use efficiency, eco-physiological parameters and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Biochar application increased growth,
   drought tolerance and leaf-N- and water-use efficiency of quinoa despite
   larger plant-leaf areas. The plants growing in biochar-amended soil
   accumulated exactly the same amount of nitrogen in their larger leaf
   biomass than the control plants, causing significantly decreased leaf
   N-, proline- and chlorophyll-concentrations. In this regard, plant
   responses to biochar closely resembled those to elevated CO2. However,
   neither soil- nor plant-soil-respiration was higher in the larger
   plants, indicating less respiratory C losses per unit of biomass
   produced. Soil-N2O emissions were significantly reduced with biochar.
   The large application rate of 200 t ha(-1) biochar did not improve plant
   growth compared to 100 t ha(-1); hence an upper beneficial level exists.
   For quinoa grown in a sandy soil, biochar application might hence
   provide a win-win strategy for increased crop production, GHG emission
   mitigation and soil C sequestration.}},

   detected in the 0.10-0.20 m layer only for all tilling devices. Porosity
   varied according to tilling, i.e., values were highest in the untilled
   soil and lower in soil that was chisel-tilled and harrowed with 0.61 m

Abstract = {{Increasing organic matter stocks in soils reduce atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2), but they may also promote emissions of nitrous oxide
   (N2O) by providing substrates for nitrification and denitrification and
   by increasing microbial O-2 consumption. The objectives of this study
   were to determine the effects of fertilization history, which had
   resulted in different soil organic matter stocks on (1) the emission
   rates of N2O and CO2 at a constant soil moisture content of 60\%
   water-holding capacity, (2) the short-term fluxes of N2O and CO2
   following the application of different fertilizers (KNO3 vs. farmyard
   manure from cattle) and (3) the response to a simulated heavy rainfall
   event, which increased soil moisture to field capacity. Soil samples
   from different treatments of three long-term fertilization experiments
   in Germany (Methau, Sproda and Bad Lauchstadt) were incubated in a
   laboratory experiment with continuous determination of N2O and CO2
   emissions and a monitoring of soil mineral N. The long-term
   fertilization treatments included application of mineral N (Methau and
   Sproda), farmyard manure + mineral N (Methau and Sproda), farmyard
   manure deposition in excess (Bad Lauchstadt) and nil fertilization (Bad
   Lauchstadt). Long-term addition of farmyard manure increased the soil
   organic C (SOC) content by 55\% at Methau (silt loam), by 17\% at Sproda
   (sandy loam) and by 88\% at Bad Lauchstadt (silt loam; extreme treatment
   which does not represent common agricultural management). Increased soil
   organic matter stocks induced by long-term application of farmyard
   manure at Methau and Sproda resulted in slightly increased N2O emissions
   at a soil moisture content of 60\% water-holding capacity. However, the
   effect of fertilization history and SOC content on N2O emissions was
   small compared to the short-term effects induced by the current
   fertilizer application. At Bad Lauchstadt, high N2O emissions from the
   treatment without fertilization for 25 years indicate the importance of
   a sustainable soil organic matter management to maintain soil structure
   and soil aeration. Emissions of N2O following the application of nitrate
   and farmyard manure differed because of their specific effects on soil
   nitrate availability and microbial oxygen consumption. At a soil

Abstract = {{Contrary to earlier studies, this study suggests that even one year of
   tillage within a long-term no-till agroecosystem adversely affected the
   soil quality, with possible negative impact on crop yields. Worldwide
   interest in conservation tillage is increasing, because conventional
   tillage adversely impacts the long-term quality of the soil and its
   vulnerability to erosion. No-till agriculture minimizes adverse impacts
   of an intensive arable land use. In some cases, occasional tillage is
   used as a means of weed or pathogen control. Therefore, this study was
   conducted in eastern Ohio to examine soil quality as affected by
   occasional tillage, i.e. disk plowed every 3-4 years, within a long-term
   no-till agroecosystem. The study compared the soil characteristics
   between two fields, both under corn (Zea mays L.) at the time of the
   study. Soil properties were studied for three depths of 0-6, 6-12, and
   12-18 cm. Compared with the continuous no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly higher bulk density of 1.45 versus
   1.31 gcm(-3), and somewhat higher soil penetration resistance of 1.77
   versus 1.56 MPa. Also, compared with the no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly lower water stable aggregate of 475
   versus 834 gkg(-1), mean weight diameter of 1.4 versus 3.4 mm, field
   moisture capacity of 293 versus 360 gkg(-1), equilibrium infiltration
   rate of 2.0 versus 6.7 mm min(-1), and cumulative infiltration of 353.4
   versus 1,211.8 mm. The field under occasional tillage had somewhat lower
   soil organic carbon of 16.0 versus 19.2 gkg(-1), soil water sorptivity
   of 16.3 versus 36.5 mm min(-0.5), and transmissivity of 2.1 versus 4.9
   mm min(-1). The occasional tillage had no effect on the soil shear
   strength. In general, the effect of tillage on soil properties decreased
   with increase in soil depth. Also corn yields were compared between the
   two agroecosystems. Compared with the no-till field, the field under
   occasional tillage had significantly lower grain moisture content of
   22.4 versus 28.2\%, and somewhat lower wet stover biomass of 14.6 versus
   20.2 Mg ha(-1), wet corn ear yield of 10.0 versus 11.4 Mg ha(-1), and
   dry grain yield of 8.2 versus 9.4 Mg ha(-1). As contrasted with earlier
   studies which were conducted under controlled research plots, this study
   was conducted under on-farm conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Homegardens or ``solares{''} have a long history of intensive
   cultivation by the Maya in southeastern Mexico and Central America, and
   have recently been the subject of increasing studies that characterize
   them as ``multistrata agroforestry systems{''}, although no soil
   evaluation has been reported. We have conducted this study in a
   traditional homegarden named ``El Naranjal{''}, a rural village in the
   north of Quintana Roo, Mexico, in order to evaluate soil date and
   quality from this specific site, being the soil the main factor of this
   traditional Maya agroforestry management system. The (14)C analysis of
   the A(1) horizon humic fraction, from the deepest soil profile exposed
   in a karstic depression, gave a date that corresponds with the
   occupation of the site at the Maya peak of the mayan possession from the
   Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition, beginning about 100 B.C.
   The soils found (Rendzic Leptosols) into El Naranjal homegarden are well
   structured, very dark brown, shallow, and have an abrupt contact with
   the limestone bedrock at a highly variable depth. According to this
   fact, soil depth showed along the studied transect, the highest
   variation (variation coefficient = 72\%) compared to Ranch Santa Maria
   (VC = 46.3\%) and El Eden (43\%) soils, being sites with similar
   heterogeneity degrees. The pH values ranged from neutral to moderately
   basic (7.10-8.00); this parameter that influences the humification and
   mineralization processes, showed a low VC (3.37\%). Organic matter
   content varied from high to very high (7.30-20.23\%, at 30-80 cm deep,
   and ranged in the deepest soil profiles from 2.00\% to 3.98\%). High
   levels of P retention (21.5-83.0\%) were found; this characteristic is
   related to high values of exchangeable Ca(2+) and dithionite-extractable
   Fe, present in all studied profiles. The soils are clayish and have
   middle to high values of hydraulic conductivity (4.8-64.8 cm h(-1)) that
   displayed a high VC (65.74\%). The values of the ``S{''} index (soil
   physical quality index) fluctuated between 0.059 and 0.068, indicating
   good physical soil quality, with regard to the proposed critical value
   of 0.035. According to other physical and chemical properties, it was
   found that the soils from this homegarden have favorable qualities for
   air transport, heat, water and soluble substances. The iron oxides and
   organic components are responsible for soil color, high aggregation with
   good stability and consequently of their high porosity. But, on the
   other hand, the highly variable soil depth (often insufficient for the
   development of root systems) and the large level of P retention
   (phosphorus-fixing capacity) are the most obvious physical and chemical
   disadvantages to crop growth. These are also the most common and
   restrictive factors in many soils from the Yucatan Peninsula. However,
   results showed that the cultivation system, successfully employed in the
   homegarden, uses an uncommon edaphic environment. This occurs through a
   traditional crop adaptation to particular areas of thicker soils
   ({''}containers{''}), known traditionally as ``precision
   agriculture{''}. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming and improvements to agricultural sustainability are
   often seen as synonymous. However, an extensive European review
   demonstrated that in practice this is not always true. This study aims
   to compare the status of soil and water properties between separate
   fields managed in either an organic or a conventional manner. Soil
   samples were collected from 16 pairs of farms, throughout England, with
   both arable and grass fields within each pair on similar soil type.
   Chemical (nutrients, pesticides, herbicides) and physical (aggregate
   stability, field capacity, shear strength, soil organic matter,
   infiltration rates) soil properties were measured in four main soil
   texture classes in organic and conventional fields. The physical soil
   properties varied significantly between the different classes of texture
   and land use. The heavier textured soils have significantly higher soil
   organic carbon (SOC), aggregate stability and shear strength. The
   coarse-textured soils have significantly lower field capacity moisture
   contents. The grassland has a significantly higher level of SOC, field
   capacity moisture content, aggregate stability and soil shear strength.
   However, there were no significant differences between organic and
   conventional treatments for any of the soil physical properties
   measured. There were fewer traces of agrochemicals in the soil water
   from the organic fields compared with the conventionally managed fields.
   The conventional arable fields had higher levels of total inorganic
   nitrogen than the other land uses and treatments. There was evidence to
   show that infiltration rates were significantly higher on organically
   managed grassland soils (7.6 mm/h) than conventionally managed grassland
   (2.5 mm/h) with lower stocking rates. The results suggest that improved
   grassland management, whether organic or conventional, could reduce
   predicted runoff by 28\%.}},

Abstract = {{Establishment of buffers and incorporation of trees and shrubs are
   believed to improve soil quality and thereby improve water quality from
   grazed pasture systems. Although enzyme activities and water stable
   aggregates have been identified as measurable soil quality parameters
   for early responses to changes in soil management, the literature lacks
   information on those parameters for grazing systems with agroforestry
   buffers. The objective of this study was to examine the activities of
   fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase
   and beta-glucosaminidase, the percentage of water stable aggregates
   (WSA) and soil organic carbon and nitrogen as soil quality parameters
   for grazed pasture and row-crop systems. The study consisted of four
   management treatments: grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB),
   grass buffer (GB) and row-crop (RC). The WSA was determined by wet
   sieving method while the enzyme activities were colorimetrically
   quantified using a spectrophotometer in laboratory assays. Soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were also determined. Two
   soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed for all treatments. The
   row-crop treatment showed significantly lower activities compared to all
   other treatments for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes
   along with lower WSA. The dehydrogenase activities were significantly
   higher in GP treatment compared to RC treatment. The FDA hydrolase
   activities were not significantly different among treatments. Surface
   soil revealed higher enzyme activities and higher WSA than the
   subsurface soil. The treatment by depth interaction was significant for
   beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes. The soil organic
   carbon and total nitrogen data strongly supported the results of enzyme
   activities and WSA. Implications can be made that perennial vegetation
   enhances organic matter accumulation in the soil, has minimum
   disturbance to the soil and will have positive impacts on the ecosystem.

Abstract = {{In Spain, agriculture triggers soil degradation and erosion processes.
   New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or
   maintain soil functionality in order to achieve a sustainable
   agriculture. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of two
   olive mill wastes (olive leaves and ``alperujo{''}) on soil properties
   and soil erosion in a rain fed olive grove in SE Spain. After three
   years experiment, oil mill wastes application significantly improved
   physical and chemical properties of the studied soil with respect to
   control. The organic matter content, bulk density and porosity were
   increased, which confirmed the interactions of these properties.
   Available water capacity increased with olive leaves but decreased when
   applied ``alperujo{''}. With respect to erosion, after simulated
   rainfall experiments it was found that the oil mill wastes contributed
   to increase the roughness and the interception of raindrops, delaying
   runoff generation and enhancing the infiltration of rainwater. Treatment
   with oil mill wastes contributed to a reduction in runoff generation and
   soil losses compared to bare soil, especially when applied olive leaves.

Abstract = {{Maintenance of soil organic matter through integrated soil fertility
   management is important for soil quality and agricultural productivity,
   and for the persistence of soil faunal diversity and biomass. Little is
   known about the interactive effects of soil fertility management and
   soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and SOM dynamics in
   tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term
   trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic
   inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil
   macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable
   aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as
   well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed
   arable systems were compared to a long-term green fallow system
   representing a relatively undisturbed reference.
   Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with
   fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as
   well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the
   soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the
   percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within
   macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with
   whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters.
   Factor analysis showed that 35.3\% of the total sample variation in
   aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was
   explained by earthworm parameters, and 25.5\% by termite parameters.
   Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome.
   The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total
   macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be
   linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the
   arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that
   feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small
   excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm
   abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of
   management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools
   than differences in termite populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Biodiversity has been a focal aim of environmental protection since the

   soil biodiversity become an important aspect of international policy.
   Edaphic fauna play a key role in many soil functions, such as organic

   moreover, affect the porosity, aeration, infiltration and distribution
   of organic matter in soil horizons, modifying soil structure and
   improving its fertility. The ecosystem services provided by soil animals
   are becoming progressively lost due to agricultural practice
   intensification, which causes a reduction in both abundance and

   permanent grassland habitat was studied in order to evaluate its
   potential as a soil biodiversity reservoir in agroecosystems. Grassland
   samples were compared with samples from a semi-natural woodland area and
   an arable land site. Microarthropod abundances, Acari/Collembola ratio

   taxa characterized both woodland and grassland soils, whereas their
   abundances were significantly higher in woodland soil. Taxon diversity
   and soil biological quality in the grasslands did not differ from the
   woodland samples. The microarthropod community in the arable land showed

Abstract = {{Exogenous organic matter has been shown to have a positive impact on the
   physical properties of agricultural soils. In some situations, the wide
   availability of organic matter and the necessity of highly restructuring
   the soils lead to the addition of very large quantities of organic
   matter (up to 40\% v/v, or 30 times more than under agricultural
   conditions). The long-term effects of the evolution of this large
   quantity of organic matter on the aggregation dynamics and structural
   characteristics of the soil arc not well known. We monitored the
   granulometric evolution of the organic matter and the stabilisation of
   the structure of urban soils placed in 600 L containers. The top layer
   was a sandy loam amended with 20\% or 40\% of organic compost - sewage
   sludge and wood chip compost or a green waste compost - laying on a
   layer of sandy loam. The organisation and the evolution of the pore
   space of the mixtures were quantified by image analysis. Our results
   showed that the total C content of the mixtures rapidly decreases during
   the first year. This decrease in C is high for coarse fractions (>1 mm)
   and is accompanied by an increase in C or the fine fractions (<0.05 mm).
   At the same time, we measured an increase in C content in aggregates
   greater than 3 mm. This preferential carbon sequestration in the
   macroaggregates leads to a significant increase in the structural
   stability over time and a modification of the aggregate organisation and
   pore distribution. After 5 months, the arrangement of the pores is
   unimodal and consists mainly of pores with a 300 mu m radius. At the end
   of the first year, the distribution becomes bimodal for the mixtures,
   with the appearance of a new porosity corresponding to elongated pores
   (radius >550 mu m). In 40\% v/v mixtures, this neoporosity corresponds
   to 39\% and 62\%, respectively, of the total surface porosity observed
   at 12 and 24 months. It results from the fractionation and the
   alteration of organic matter particles. We showed that when organic
   particles break down, they surround the aggregates already present in
   the soil with a fine film and protect them from degradation. In our
   study, aggregates are dynamic entities whose stability increases over
   time in relation to the breakdown of organic matter particles introduced
   in large quantities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   degradation impacts Africa's agricultural viability and food security.
   Primary forest and farm fields deforested between 1930 and 2000 were
   sampled along a chronosequence on two parent materials in western Kenya.
   Two traditional long-term management systems were sampled: continuous
   low-input maize (Zea mays; Co), and kitchen garden (Ki) polyculture with
   organic inputs. Physical, biological, and chemical SQ indicators were
   measured. Degradation in Co followed exponential decay trends for most
   indicators (organic matter, active C, water-stable aggregates, available
   water capacity, electrical conductivity, CEC, pH, Ca, Mg and Zn), as
   well as for yield. Organic matter quality declined linearly, suggesting
   degradation will continue. For both parent materials and most indicators
   degradation of 25-93\% below initial values resulted, but with <= 40\%
   further drop below initial values and for more indicators under Co than
   Ki. P. Zn and possibly K accumulated over time under Ki. The extent of
   degradation was influenced by parent material. In conclusion, a basic
   accessible set of SQ indicators was successfully used to describe soil
   degradation dynamics under cultivation. Results suggest that regular
