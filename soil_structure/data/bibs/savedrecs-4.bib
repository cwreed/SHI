Abstract = {{Upland blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Read.) requires acidic and organic
   matter rich soils for its cultivation. Recently, the raised bed
   cultivation system has widely been used for blueberry cultivation, but
   it has a potential to cause nitrogen (N) losses via leaching and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emission especially with high rate of N application. We
   investigated the effects of organic amendments on N losses; via leaching
   ammonium ({[}image omitted]) and nitrate ({[}image omitted]) and N2O
   emission under acid soil conditions. The treatments were (i) ammonium
   sulfate application (AS), (ii) AS with peat moss (AS + PM), and (iii) AS
   with sawdust compost (AS + SD). A container (surface area: 47 cm x 40 cm
   = 0.188 m2) experiment to simulate raised bed cultivation system using
   an ochric Cambisol was conducted at Chiba University, Japan, during 2008
   and 2009. A blueberry plant in each container received N fertilizer
   three times: 14.8, 23.8, and 14.8 g N m-2 in July 2008, March, and July
   2009, respectively. Incorporation of peat moss and sawdust compost with
   ferrous sulfate effectively decreased soil pH to its optimal ranges
   (4.0-5.2) and resulted in increased growth and yield of blueberry (berry
   yield of 2009: 93, 285, and 348 g plant-1 in AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD
   treatment, respectively) due to increased soil porosity and consequently
   enhanced plant root biomass. Concurrently, the AS + SD treatment
   resulted in the least N losses, followed by AS + PM and AS treatment
   both through leaching and N2O emission. The emitted N2O amount over
   about two-year blueberry cultivation were 1.28, 0.80, and 0.58 g N m-2
   for AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatments, respectively. These results
   indicated that application of organic amendments decreased N losses to
   the environment most likely due to increased plant N uptake, microbial N
   immobilization, and consequent reduction in nitrification,
   denitrification, and leaching.}},

Title = {{Impact of organic inputs on wettability characteristics and structural
   stability in silty vineyard topsoil}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{183-194}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Organic inputs were used for 10 years on a French vineyard topsoil to
   improve structural stability and thus to protect against erosion. The
   three types of organic inputs (mulches) included: conifer compost, CC
   (100 m3 ha-1 every 3 years); conifer bark, CB (300 m3 ha-1 every 5
   years); and cereal straw, S (10 t ha-1 every 2 years). The other two
   types of organic inputs were cover crops of clover (C) and fescue (F).
   The impacts of these organic inputs on soil organic carbon (SOC)
   content, wettability (capillary rise and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS)) and structural stability were studied. The SOC
   content was twice as large in the CC, C and F topsoils (SOC content of
   2.56-3.24\%) as in the reference (R) topsoil (SOC content of 1.39\%).
   Both apparent contact angle (theta) and surface OH:C mass ratio
   indicated that the R and S topsoils were hydrophilic (theta of 27.4-33.4
   degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 3.20-4.41), whereas the CB, C and F
   topsoils were partially hydrophobic (theta of 69.1-79.8 degrees, surface
   OH:C ratio of 1.36-2.86), and the CC topsoil had intermediate values
   (theta of 46.9 degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 2.43-2.81). Moreover, the
   greater the theta value, the smaller the water sorptivity value and the
   greater the proportion of water-stable aggregates, Ag(w). The increase
   in SOC content had beneficial effects on Ag(w), particularly for the
   partially hydrophobic C and F topsoils (Ag(w) of 22.3-44.5\%) against
   the hydrophilic R and S topsoils (Ag(w) of 8.2-12.7\%). Development of
   hydrophobicity, correlated with the decrease in the surface OH:C ratio
   and the increase in the C-O, C-N proportion on surface C, should be
   attributed to humified organic matter or/and to plant and microbial
   polysaccharides. As the XPS and aggregate stability data describe soil
   physical processes at small scales (nm to mm), we suggest an
   experimental and modelling framework for upscaling these results for
   practical improvement and management of vineyard soils.}},

Abstract = {{The role of organic matter (OM) in soil aggregation and saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) has long been recognised but their
   depedence on the intensity of decay is less studied. The objective of
   this study was to determine the effect of decomposition intensity of
   incorporated chickpea manure on soil aggregate stability and Ksat.
   Samples of a clay loam and clay soil were collected from the top 15 cm
   layer and amended with chickpea green or mature dry manure and incubated
   at 30 degrees C and similar to 60\% water holding capacity.
   Decomposition intensity was determined by measuring CO2 evolution using
   NaOH traps, aggregate stability by wet sieving and Ksat by the constant
   head method. All determinations were made 3, 7 and 30 days after
   incubation and the data analysed following the general linear model for
   a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial in randomised complete block design. Evolution of
   CO2 in both soils and manure was highest on day 7 compared to day 3 and
   30. In both soils >60\% of the soil aggregates were macroaggregates >0.5
   mm but the relative proportion of microaggregates <0.5 mm increased from
   similar to 10 to similar to 20\% in the control and to similar to 15\%
   in the amended cay loam soil in the day 30 treatments. Decomposition
   intensity was increased by incorporating chickpea manure which resulted
   in improved soil aggregate stability and Ksat especially in soil with
   low clay content. CO2 which is a simple product of decomposition may be
   used as a rapid indicator of soil aggregate stability and water movement
   in agricultural soils.}},

Abstract = {{A field survey was conducted to quantify the benefits of applying

   infiltration rate and gravimetric water at 1 bar tension. Across all

   soil microbial activity (2.23 x control), gravimetric water (1.57 x

   compost amended soils was similar to availability in conventionally
   managed soils. Infiltration times were significantly reduced in compost
   amended soils in comparison to control soils. High rates of compost
   application showed more significant benefits in comparison to low rates
   of compost application and control soils. At lower application rates,
   compost amended soils were statistically similar to controls for most

Abstract = {{The influence of cover crops and their management on the maintenance or

   and fallow on physical properties of soil under organic cultivation of
   common bean and corn, in no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)
   systems. The study was conducted in Santo Antonio de Goias-GO, on an

   November 2003 four experiments were installed, two of them under NT and
   the other two in CT. In each management system, one experiment was

   from the layers 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m in November 2007, from the
   plots and from a neighboring native forest, to determine soil organic
   matter (SOM) and physical properties. The use of this soil for
   agricultural production, regardless of the tillage system, reduced the
   SOM content and affected the physical properties, increased bulk density
   (BD) and soil penetration resistance (PR) and decreased macroporosity
   (Mp), soil porosity (SP), and the weighted mean diameter of aggregates
   (WMDA). However, BD and Mp did not reach the critical values indicated
   in the literature as limiting for crop growth. The soil tillage systems
   diverged in relation to WMDA and PR. The soil physical properties were

Abstract = {{Concerns about groundwater contamination as well as pesticide residues

   of chemical-intensive agriculture. Search has been prompted for
   agronomic strategies with lower environmental hazards. In this
   multidisciplinary study we compared the characteristics of soils from 20
   agricultural farms selected in five geographical areas of Southern Italy
   with different soil types. In each farm, fields with management regime
   classified as high-input (HIMR, intensive cultivation under plastic
   tunnels) or low-input (LIMR, tree orchards) were selected. Soil samples
   were analyzed for 31 parameters including physical and chemical
   properties (bulk density, water holding capacity, texture, pH,
   limestone, electrical conductivity, organic Cm a depth of 0-20 and 20-40
   cm, total N, P(2)O(5), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), Na(+), cation exchange
   capacity), enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase,arylsulphatase,
   beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and urease) and microbiological features
   (potential respiration, functional diversity of microbial populations by
   BIOLOG EcoPlates (TM), microbial biomass, fungal mycelium, culturable
   actinomycetes, bacteria and fungi, pseudomonads and bacterial species
   richness by 16S rDNA-DGGE). Finally, a soil bioassay was performed in
   order to evaluate the plant growth of a biotest plant (Lactuca sativa)
   and soil suppressiveness of the Rhizoctonia solani-L. sativa
   pathosystem.
   Results showed that many soil properties were influenced by management
   regime more than by the sampling area. Compared to LIMR, HIMR soils
   consistently had reduced soil organic C (-24\%), enzymatic activities,
   microbial biomass and fungal mycelium (-40\% and -18\%, respectively),
   functional diversity (-18\%) and bacterial species richness (-14\%). On
   the contrary, the same soils showed a remarkable increase in the values
   of the parameters related to the mineral soil fraction (electrical
   conductivity +370\%; P(2)O(5) +72\%; Na(+) +86\%). Management regime did
   not affect cation exchange capacity, pH, limestone and soil texture. The
   lettuce bioassay showed a higher plant growth (+17\%) in the LIMR
   compared to HIMR soils, despite the lower content of mineral nutrients.
   Suppression of R. solani was not influenced by management regime, but
   significant differences were recorded among farms. Differences among the
   assessed soil parameters indicate a trend of soil quality deterioration
   under the high-input management regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This work investigated sediment samples collected from Dapeng Bay and
   three neigh-boring rivers (Kaoping River, Tungkang River, and Lingbeng
   River) in southwestern Taiwan, Republic of China. Multivariate
   statistical analysis techniques, i.e., factor analysis, cluster
   analysis, and canonical discriminant analysis were used for the
   evaluation of spatial variations to determine the types of pollution and
   to identify pollutant sources from neighboring rivers. Factor analysis
   results showed that the most important latent factors in Dapeng Bay are
   soil texture, heavy metals, organic matter, and nutrients factors.
   Contour maps incorporating the factor scores showed heavy metals
   accumulate along the lakesides, especially on the southeastern banks of
   the lakes. A cluster analysis was performed using factor scores computed
   from these latent factors. We then classified these areas into five
   distinct classes using sampling stations, and we illustrate that in the
   three river classes, the sediment properties are influenced by
   industrial and domestic wastewater and agricultural activities
   (including livestock rearing and farm activities). However, in Dapeng
   Bay, the rivers were influenced more by complicated biogeochemical
   processes; these could be identified as a type of pollution. Canonical
   discriminant analysis illustrated that two constructed discriminant
   functions made a marked contribution to most of the discriminant
   variables, and the significant parameters of porosity and Cd, Cr, Al,
   and Pb content were combined as the ``heavy metal factor{''}. The
   recognition capacities of the two discriminant functions were 82.6\% and
   17.4\%, respectively. It is also likely that the annual mean of the
   water exchange rate is insufficient (taking about 7 days to eliminate
   pollutants) and therefore has significantly influenced the carbon and
   nutrient biogeochemical processes and budgets in the semi-enclosed
   ecosystem. Thus, the sediment properties are not similar between the
   lagoon and the neighboring rivers. Our results yield useful information
   concerning estuary recovery and water resources management and may be
   applicable to other basins with similar characteristics that are
   experiencing similar coastal environmental issues.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of composted buffalo manure may lead to qualitative and
   quantitative improvement of the organic matter content of degraded
   tropical agricultural soils in Northern Vietnam. The objectives of this
   study were to follow the biochemical changes occurring during composting
   of buffalo manure with and without earthworms during 3 months and to
   study the effect of the end products (compost and vermicompost) on soil
   biochemical parameters and plant growth after two months of incubation
   under controlled conditions in an open pot experiment. Our conceptual
   approach included characterisation of organic matter of the two composts
   before and after addition to soil by elemental, isotopic analysis and
   analytical pyrolysis and comparison with conventional fertilisation. We
   also analysed for lignin content and composition.
   Our results showed that composting in the presence of earthworms led to
   stronger transformation of buffalo manure than regular composting.
   Vermicompost was enriched in N-containing compounds and depleted in
   polysaccharides. It further contained stronger modified lignin compared
   to regular compost. In the bulk soil, the amendment of compost and
   vermicompost led to significant modification of the soil organic matter
   after 2 months of exposure to natural weather conditions. The lignin
   component of SOM was unaffected whatever the origin of the organic
   amendment. Compost and vermicompost amendments both enhanced aggregation
   and increased the amount of organic matter in water stable aggregates.
   However, vermicompost is preferable to compost due to its beneficial
   effect on plant growth, while having similar positive effects on
   quantity and quality of SOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions are good indicators of
   soil quality and environmental stability. Among the factors affecting
   SOC pool and fluxes in a watershed, land use changes and soil erosion
   are factors of importance. The differences in SOC and its fractions
   among different land uses can help understand the process of soil carbon
   dynamics. A study was conducted in Typic Ustochrepts of Northwest India
   to understand the impact of forest, grassland, agricultural and eroded
   lands on aggregate stability and SOC fractions. The undisturbed soil
   aggregates were sampled from different land uses in a watershed in
   Shiwaliks of lower Himalayas. The aggregate stability was determined by
   shaking the pre-saturated aggregates under water and by single simulated
   raindrop technique. The SOC, labile carbon, hot-water soluble carbon,
   particulate organic carbon and aggregate associated organic carbon were
   determined in aggregates of different sizes as well as in the bulk
   soils. The water stability of aggregates expressed as mean weight
   diameter (MWD) and stability index (SI(SRT)) was highest in surface
   soils (0-15 cm) of grasslands followed by forest, agricultural and
   eroded lands. The WSA > 2 mm (water stable aggregates > 2 mm) were
   highest (17.3\%) in grasslands and lowest (0.85\%) in eroded lands. The
   eroded soils had 2.2, 7.4 and 3.4 times higher amount of
   micro-aggregates (WSA < 0.25 mm) than agricultural, forest and grassland
   soils, respectively. The SOC in surface soils significantly decreased by
   27\% in forest and 45\% in agricultural land from that in grassland
   soils. In subsoil (15-30 cm), the SOC in eroded, agricultural and
   grasslands was statistically similar. The SOC stock in the subsoil
   (15-100 cm) was of significance. The grassland soils could store 41 Mg
   ha(-1) SOC stock compared to 31 Mg ha(-1) in the subsurface layer. This
   difference widened in forestland, where subsoil contained 73.4\% of
   total SOC stock in 100 cm soil profile. Among all the SOC fractions
   studied, labile carbon was mostly affected by erosion and was 91.6\%
   lower in eroded than in grassland soils. The magnitude of aggregate
   associated organic carbon decreased with aggregate size in all the land
   uses. Among the SOC fractions, the aggregate stability under simulated
   raindrop impact could better be explained (R (2) = 0.78) by hot water
   soluble carbon whereas the water stability of aggregate could better be
   explained (R (2) = 0.69) by particulate organic carbon.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Establishment of cover crops is an effective way to reverse the soil
   fertility decline, which can be caused by a range of inappropriate
   traditional agriculture practices, particularly tillage and inorganic
   fertiliser application. In this study, soil properties were assessed
   under various cultivation regimes of different crops, including legumes,
   grass, and nursery natural rubber (NR) trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.
   Arg.), in southern Vietnam. The crops studied had all been growing for 7
   years commencing in 1999, on light-textured Acrisols. Soils under the
   cultivation regime of creeping legumes including Calopogonium caeruleum,
   Pueraria phaseoloides, and Stylosanthes gracilis had significantly
   higher carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and porosity than
   soils under the other management types studied. Soils under Brachiaria
   ruziziensis and P. phaseoloides had the highest aggregate stability.
   Cultivation regimes with tillage, field traffic, and inorganic
   fertilisers applied to nursery NR trees increased phosphorus (P)
   availability, but this was accompanied by increased soil compaction and
   reductions in most of the other soil properties analysed. Relative to
   the nursery NR cultivation, creeping-legume cultivation increased soil C
   concentration (by 95\%), soil pH(H2O) (by 19\%), macro-aggregates (by
   29\%), and porosity (by 8\%). From principal component analysis, three
   soil properties-soil organic carbon (SOC), porosity, and P
   availability-were selected as key indicators suitable for the evaluation
   of the effects of cultivation on soils. Establishment of C. caeruleum
   and B. ruziziensis was most effective in improving soil C content, and
   soil porosity was significantly higher under C. caeruleum and P.
   phaseoloides. These findings suggest that each cover crop had its own
   dominant agro-characteristics and that selection of a cover crop to
   either improve soil fertility or reduce compaction should be considered
   by farmers in this region.}},

Abstract = {{The productivity of the Vertisols of the Accra plains is low, in spite
   of its high potential fertility. This could be attributed to physical
   constraints and low organic matter content. A study was conducted at the
   Agricultural Research Centre, Kpong, to assess the suitability of Mucuna
   pruriens, Mimosa invisa and Stylosanthes guianensis, in short fallows,
   for improving the fertility, physical properties, moisture conservation
   and weed control in the case of these soils. Mucuna had the highest
   biomass of 5.3tha(-1), as opposed to 4.1tha(-1) under natural fallow.
   The mucuna and stylosanthes biomass had comparatively higher total N
   values (240.75 and 203.51kgha(-1), respectively) than mimosa and natural
   fallow (152.46 and 162.74kgha(-1), respectively). Soil organic carbon,
   one year after the incorporation of cover crops, was found to be
   relatively higher under the cover crops (mucuna, stylosanthes and
   mimosa) than it was under natural fallow. Bulk densities were thus lower
   under the cover crops than they were under natural fallow. Also, soils
   under the cover crops had higher total porosity, water infiltration
   rates and moisture storage than they did under natural fallow. Weed
   cover, 115 days after planting maize, was significantly lower in plots
   previously under Mucuna pruriens than it was under natural fallow,
   Stylosanthes guianensis and Mimosa invisa. There was a negative linear
   correlation between cover crop biomass and weed density (R(2) =
   0.593-0.805). Grain and stover yields of maize were higher under Mucuna
   pruriens than they were under natural fallow (138 and 70 per cent
   higher, respectively). Burning of the natural fallow resulted in greater
   weed growth than when the material was worked into the soil (41 and 8
   per cent, respectively). Grain yield was significantly greater under
   mucuna than it was under natural fallow (3.1 and 1.3tha(-1),
   respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Tillage practices can pronouncely affect soil hydraulic and physical

   completely randomized plots with three replicates, representing

   (RT3) and no-till (NT) in Arik Clay (Typic Haploxererts) in southern
   Anatolia of Turkey. In each plot, five infiltration tests were conducted
   using double-ring constant-water-level infiltrometers. The data were
   analyzed by ANOVA and the means of treatments were grouped by LSD
   technique. Both RT and NT decreased infiltration rate (IR),
   significantly, and this was attributed to decreased total and
   macroporosity together with high proportion of swelling clays.
   Furthermore, residue burning decreased infiltration rate significantly
   compared to residue incorporated soils in conventionally tilled soils,
   and this was attributed to decreased total porosity and macroporosity in
   the former. Arik clay series is one of the largest soil series
   intensively used for agriculture on level to slightly sloping landscapes
   of Southeastern region of Turkey. Therefore, the results suggest that
   reduced and no-tillage should be applied cautiously in Arik series soils
   to avoid problems such as water loss by runoff in sloping areas and
   water logging in level areas. The results may have significant
   implications for similar soils formed in Mediterranean climate.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the tillage and application of mulch are important strategies
   for soil and water conservation and sustainability of agricultural
   systems. Soil can be a source or sink for carbon (C) depending on
   management strategies and plays a major role in the global C cycle.
   These interacting practices can alter nutrient movement and availability
   to the crops, reduce water loss, slow down organic-matter (OM)
   decomposition, and thus enhance C sequestration. A 2-year field study
   was conducted to quantify the tillage and mulching effect on soil
   organic C (SOC), OM, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) at
   two depths (i.e., 0-15 and 15-30 cm deep) in the soil profile and N, P,
   and K concentrations (g kg-1) in plant shoots at harvest on a Typic
   Calciargids in wheat-maize rotation. The four tillage systems used were
   zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT), and
   deep tillage (DT), and four mulch rates {[}control, 2 (M2), 4 (M4), and
   6 (M6) Mg ha-1 year-1 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw] were applied
   in combination with each tillage system, keeping recommended rates of
   fertilizers. There was a linear positive response of mulch application
   on SOC for both years, but it was more pronounced during the second
   year. Greater values were found in ZT and the lowest in CT at all
   depths, although greater SOC content was found in upper layers than in
   deeper ones. Greater shoot N, P, and K concentrations were found in MT,
   CT, and DT, whereas the lowest concentration was found in ZT. Mulch
   application has no effect on N, P, and K concentrations in shoots. The
   soil N concentration was not affected by tillage and mulch, yet greater
   soil N content was found at 0-15 cm than 15-30 cm deep. There was
   significant effect of tillage on soil P and K during one year as greater
   P and K concentrations were found under MT, CT, and DT compared to ZT.
   More N, P, K, and OM concentrations were found at 0-15 cm deep than at
   15-30 cm deep during the whole study period. Mulch effect was
   significant on K, and significantly greater amounts were found at
   greater levels of mulch application. The increases in the soil OM were
   34.5, 35.75, and 24\% at 0-8, 8-16, and 16-24 cm deep respectively from
   the first year to the second year. Tillage effect on soil organic-matter
   content was not significant. Tillage increased grain production for both
   years. For the first year, 22.9 and 27\% greater yields were found in CT
   and DT, whereas in the second year yields were 10.6, 17.9, and 57\%
   greater, respectively, in MT, CT, and DT as compared to ZT. Grain
   production was increased at a result of mulch application by 12.9, 20.3,
   and 10.6\% during the first year and 11.45, 23.74, and 10.9\% during the
   second year as compared to control (i.e., without mulch). Results show
   the importance of mulch application and crop residue retention. Both can
   increase the SOC content and water-holding capacity, which will result
   in improved production and soil physical health over long and continuous
   use of mulch.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive use of poultry litter (PL) on agricultural land is known to
   cause eutrophication of surface waters. Consequently, both poultry
   producers and PL users have to meet strict state and federal guidelines
   on litter storage and land application. This study examined the
   environmental benefits of adding lime, alum, ferrous sulfate, fly ash
   (FA), fluidized bed ash (FBA) and soil fix (SF) to PL for immobilizing
   excess phosphorus (P) while providing sufficient nutrients for proper
   growth of soybean {[}Glycine max (L.)] and corn {[}Zea mays (L.)] on a
   rotation. Amending PL with lime, alum, SF, FA and FBA significantly
   (p0.05) increased corn and soybean yield. In contrast control plots that
   received a 10-10-10 (N-P2O5-K2) fertilizer showed lower yield and corn
   quality. Increased yield was observed when PL was amended with lime,
   alum and ferrous sulfate. Results from a soybean root, shoot, and nodule
   growth study indicated variability with respect to PL application and
   amendment use. Smaller size nodules were obtained with NPK fertilizer
   and PL plus lime treated plots, whereas PL with alum yielded fewer but
   larger nodules. Soil aggregation was significantly lower in soils
   treated with NPK compared to those treated with PL as indicated by water
   stable aggregation (WSA), mean aggregate diameter (MWD) and geometric
   mean of aggregate diameter (GMD) (p0.05). Increased soil aggregation was
   a result of the combined effect of amendment and PL additions rather
   than PL alone. The amount of carbon (C) in soil aggregates was lowest
   with NPK and highest with PL treatments. In the presence of PL, alum and
   iron treatments showed higher capacities to store C and immobilize P in
   macro-aggregates (8 to 5 mm diameter). These results suggest that soil
   treatment with PL and chemical amendments, especially alum and ferrous
   sulfate, could result in improved crop yield, soil aggregation, carbon
   storage, and P immobilization.}},

   and NT a/m, respectively) Avena strigosa + Vicia sativa and maize +
   Vigna unguiculata (CT av / mu and NT av / mu, respectively). A

   concentration, water stable aggregate-size distribution and aggregate
   carbon concentration from 0 to 40 cm soil depth. Three tillage
   experiments were chosen, all located in northeast Spain and using
   contrasting tillage types but with different lengths of time since their
   establishment (20, 17, and 1-yr). In the two fields with mouldboard
   ploughing as CT, NT sequestered more SOC in the 0-5 cm layer compared
   with CT. However, despite there being no significant differences, SOC
   tended to accumulate under CT compared with NT in the 20-30 and 30-40 cm
   depths in the AG-17 field with 25-50\% higher SOC content in CT compared
   with NT. Greater amounts of large and small macroaggregates under NT
   compared with CT were measured at 0-5 cm depth in AG-17 and at 5-10 cm
   in both AG-1 and AG-17. Differences in macroaggregate C concentration
   between tillage treatments were only found in the AG-17 field at the
   soil surface with 19.5 and 11.6 g C/kg macroaggregates in NT and CT,
   respectively. After 17 yr of experiment, CT with mouldboard ploughing
   resulted in a greater total SOC concentration and macroaggregate C
   concentration below 20 cm depth, but similar macroaggregate content
   compared with NT. This study emphasizes the need for adopting whole-soil
   profile approaches when studying the suitability of NT versus CT for SOC
   sequestration and CO(2) offsetting.}},

Abstract = {{The latest advances in bioregenerative strategies for long-term life
   support in extraterrestrial outposts such as on Mars have indicated
   soil-based cropping as an effective approach for waste decomposition,
   carbon sequestration, oxygen production, and water biofiltration as
   compared to hydroponics and aeroponics cropping. However, it is still
   unknown if cropping using soil systems could be sustainable in a Martian
   greenhouse under a gravity of 0.38g. The most challenging aspects are
   linked to the gravity-induced soil water flow; because water is crucial
   in driving nutrient and oxygen transport in both liquid and gaseous
   phases, a gravitational acceleration lower than g = 9.806 m s(-2) could
   lead to suffocation of microorganisms and roots, with concomitant
   emissions of toxic gases. The effect of Martian gravity on soil
   processes was investigated using a highly mechanistic model previously
   tested for terrestrial crops that couples soil hydraulics and nutrient
   biogeochemistry. Net leaching of NO(3)(-) solute, gaseous fluxes of
   NH(3), CO(2), N(2)O, NO and N(2), depth concentrations of O(2), CO(2)
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and pH in the root zone were
   calculated for a bioregenerative cropping unit under gravitational
   acceleration of Earth and for its homologous on Mars, but under 0.38g.
   The two cropping units were treated with the same fertilizer type and
   rate, and with the same irrigation regime, but under different initial
   soil moisture content. Martian gravity reduced water and solute leaching
   by about 90\% compared to Earth. This higher water holding capacity in
   soil under Martian gravity led to moisture content and nutrient
   concentrations that favoured the metabolism of various microbial
   functional groups, whose density increased by 5-10\% on Mars as compared
   to Earth. Denitrification rates became substantially more important than
   on Earth and ultimately resulted in 60\%, 200\% and 1200\% higher
   emissions of NO, N(2)O and N(2) gases, respectively. Similarly, O(2) and
   DOC were consumed more rapidly in the Martian soil and resulted in about
   10\% increase in CO(2) emissions. More generally, Martian cropping would
   require 90\% less water for irrigation than on Earth, being therefore
   favourable for water recycling treatment; in addition, a substantially
   lower nutrient supply from external sources such as fertilizers would
   not compromise nutrient delivery to soil microorganisms, but would
   reduce the large N gas emissions observed in this study. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The rehabilitation of sandy desertified land in semi-arid and arid
   regions has a great potential to increase carbon sequestration and
   improve soil quality. Our objective was to investigate the changes in
   the soil carbon pool and soil properties of surface soil (0-15 cm) under
   different types of rehabilitation management. Our study was done in the
   short-term (7 years) and long-term (32 years) desertification control
   sites in a marginal oasis of northwest China. The different management
   treatments were: (1) untreated shifting sand land as control; (2)
   sand-fixing shrubs with straw checkerboards; (3) poplar (Populus
   gansuensis) shelter forest; and (4) irrigated cropland after leveling
   sand dune. The results showed that the rehabilitation of severe sandy
   desertified land resulted in significant increases in soil organic C
   (SOC), inorganic C, and total N concentrations, as well as enhanced soil
   aggregation. Over a 7-year period of revegetation and cultivation, SOC
   concentration in the recovered shrub land, forest land and irrigated
   cropland increased by 4.1, 14.6 and 11.9 times compared to the control
   site (shifting sand land), and increased by 11.2, 17.0 and 23.0 times
   over the 32-year recovery period. Total N, labile C (KMnO4-oxidation C),
   C management index (CMI) and inorganic C (CaCO3-C) showed a similar
   increasing trend as SOC. The increased soil C and N was positively
   related to the accumulation of fine particle fractions. The accumulation
   of silt and clay, soil C and CaCO3 enhanced the formation of aggregates,
   which was beneficial to mitigate wind erosion. The percentage of >0.25
   mm dry aggregates increased from 18.0\% in the control site to
   20.0-87.2\% in the recovery sites, and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of
   water-stable aggregates significantly increased, with a range of
   0.09-0.30 mm at the recovery sites. Long-term irrigation and
   fertilization led to a greater soil C and N accumulation in cropland
   than in shrub and forest lands. The amount of soil C sequestration
   reached up to 1.8-9.4 and 7.5-17.3 Mg ha(-1) at the 0-15 cm layer over a
   7- and 32-year rehabilitation period compared to the control site,
   suggesting that desertification control has a great potential for
   sequestering soil C and improving soil quality in northwest China. (C)

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage and judicious use of animal manures as fertilizers
   can make significant contributions for sustainable food production in
   the twenty-first century. Identifying and understanding the many
   interactions occurring within agricultural systems is fundamental for
   accomplishing this feat. This paper synthesizes 14 years of research
   results from a study that began in the early 1990s in which researchers
   from USDA-ARS and the University of Georgia investigated cropping system
   influences on nutrient management under natural rainfall. Increases in C
   and N with no-till resulted in improved soil structure that increased
   infiltration rate and soil water availability. Biological activity as
   indicated by earthworms was greater with no-till and poultry litter
   (PL). In all but the very driest year, yields of cotton and corn
   increased on average 10-27\% with no-till and 32-42\% with combination
   of no-till and PL. On the other hand soil nutrient accumulation,
   particularly P and Zn from long-term use of poultry litter in corn
   production, reached excessive levels and could present environmental
   risks. Drainage increased in no-till raising the risk of leaching of
   nutrients into the soil profile. However, runoff decreased in no-till
   and the presence of a rye cover crop during the winter reduced the
   leaching losses of N compared to no cover crop. During cotton production
   under relative drought, no-till and poultry litter led to somewhat
   elevated dissolved phosphorus concentration in runoff, and fluometuron
   was detected in runoff and drainage while pendimethalin was not. Fecal
   indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal enterococci), and the
   hormones estradiol and testosterone were observed in drainage and runoff
   but concentrations were similar across all treatments. By conducting the
   study for an extended period under natural environmental conditions, we
   were able to highlight real risks and potentials of the contrasting
   cropping systems. While 6 out of 14 years of relative drought might have
   limited the water quality response of treatments, such droughts are
   common features of the weather pattern in the region. Even then, use of
   no-till as the predominant tillage system was supported by improved
   yields. Fertilizer management, especially crop N need-based use of PL,
   requires closer monitoring to insure that production advantages of
   no-till and poultry litter are not offset by concerns with environmental
   risks. Long-term research requires sustained resource inputs to answer
   critical questions of environmental risk and emerging unknown issues.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid areas comprise a large portion of the world's agricultural
   crop land. These areas are characterised by high temperature and low
   rainfall which hinders soil organic matter accumulation. The reported
   experiments were designed to study the effect of soil organic matter
   (SOM) from green manure crops on soil physical properties in two
   contrasting soils, sandy clay loam and loamy sand under the severe
   conditions of high temperature and low rainfall that exist in the
   eastern wheat belt of Western Australia. To remove soil physical and
   chemical constraints, the soils were deep ripped to 0.4 m after the
   application of 2.5 t/ha of gypsum. Basal fertilizers were applied
   according to soil tests to remove possible nutrient deficiencies.
   Cereals and legume crops were incorporated by disc cultivation into the
   soils as green manure for four consecutive years. Two plant groups,
   cereals and legumes were used to provide green manure. Oat (Avena
   sativa) as a cereal with high C:N ratio (95) and either faba bean (Vicia
   faba), field pea (Pisum sativum) or lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) were
   used as legumes with low C: N ratios (12 - 18). These crops were
   arranged in three treatments for each soil type consisting of different
   crop sequences. A total of between 14 and 20 t/ha of green material was
   incorporated into the top soil over four years. All treatments increased
   soil organic matter significantly compared to the initial soil values
   but no significant differences between treatments (crop sequences) were
   observed. Water stable aggregates and soil bulk density were
   significantly improved by all treatments but no significant differences
   were observed between treatments. Soil water infiltration was not
   significantly increased by the green manure treatments after ripping and
   gypsum addition, though it was significantly different between
   treatments. The SOM increased from around 1.28 to 1.96\%, well below the
   critical value suggested in the literature for more humid areas to
   sustain healthy soil, and not as high as expected from the high quantity
   of green material returned to the soil. However, the levels of organic
   carbon increase were comparable with those predicted from a CSIRO carbon
   model. These results point to the dominant role of soil and weather
   conditions in the low rainfall cropping zone of Western Australia in
   limiting the build-up of soil organic matter content, regardless of
   amount or composition of green manure applied.}},

Title = {{Mapping suitability for Sangiovese wine by means of delta C-13 and

Abstract = {{A three year experiment was carried out to test the possibility of using
   the carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) measured in wine, combined with
   data of proximal and remote soil sensors, to assess viticultural and
   oenological suitability for Sangiovese. Two specialized vineyards on
   similar geomorphological conditions were investigated. Twelve plots were
   positioned differently along slopes. The soils were similar, except for
   structure, porosity and related hydrological characteristics, and
   salinity of the deeper horizons.
   Soil electrical conductivity and resistivity were measured at three
   different depths, as well as cumulative soil moisture down to the
   root-limiting layer. Satellite images were analyzed to obtain the NDVI.
   Soil water content in the plots was monitored at different depths.
   Yield, phenological phases, and chemical analysis of grapes were
   determined. Stem water potential was measured during summer. Grapes of
   each plot were collected for wine making in small barrels. The wines
   obtained were analyzed and submitted to a blind organoleptic testing.
   The wine was also analyzed for its delta C-13 isotopic ratio.
   Almost all plots had rather high amounts of transpirable water, even
   during the driest time of the year. However, only yield components of
   Sangiovese were influenced by water availability. Wine quality was
   instead significantly improved by the moderate salinity of the deeper
   horizons, which increased plant water stress during berry ripening and
   reduced production. The moderate physiological stress affecting vines
   was reflected in stem water potentials and delta C-13 values. delta C-13
   was correlated with several viticultural and oenological parameters, and
   also with panel test evaluations of wine quality. The threshold between
   good and bad scores corresponded to a delta C-13 value of -26.7 +/- 1.2
   parts per thousand.
   Soil salinity affected the geophysical survey and its relationship with
   the viticultural and oenological result. In particular, the
   electromagnetic conductivity measured at the beginning of the experiment
   was functional in distinguishing the two vineyards, but it was not
   useful for a more detailed prediction of Sangiovese performance.
   However, electromagnetic resistivity in the first 0.5 m was not
   influenced by salinity of the deep soil horizons, but only by clay
   content, and permitted a significant estimation of the Sangiovese
   anthocyanins content, colour intensity, and must acidity.
   The outcomes of this study recommend the use of delta C-13 in
   combination with electromagnetic resistivity to map soil suitability for
   Sangiovese. The favourable performance of Sangiovese in moderately
   saline soils may encourage diffusion of the cultivar outside its
   traditional areas of cultivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   no-till with corn-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) conventional
   tillage with wheat/soybean sequence (CT-S) at Galvez: and a) no-till
   with corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) no-till with
   wheat/soybean sequence (NT-S) at Videla. Tension values of 0, 1.5 and 3
   cm were applied using tension infiltrometers with the aim of obtaining
   soil hydraulic conductivity measurements (K(0), K(1.5), and K(3)), and
   several hydraulic parameters (pore size, pore number, effective
   macroporosity, conducting macroporosity (epsilon((a,b))), water flow and
   water flow decrease). Undisturbed soil cores were collected to determine
   water release curves (WRC) and soil bulk density (Db). The total
   macroporosity (Ma) and pore size frequency curve were determined from
   the fitted model of the WRC. Macropore connectivity was calculated using
   epsilon((a,b)) and Ma. In Galvez, the Db values. K at all tensions, the
   number of effective pores, the mean pore radius and the effective
   macroporosity were significantly higher for NT-R. The conducting and
   total macroporosity values were similar in NT-R and CT-S, but the pores
   had better continuity in NT-R. In Videla, only K(0) and K(1.5) showed
   statistical differences in favor of NT-R. This treatment also had a
   greater number of effective pores, and higher effective, conducting and
   total macroporosity values, apart from the overall better pore
   connectivity. There were no significant differences between the NT-R and
   CT-S for Db and K(3). The evaluated indicators determined that the pore
   network characteristics are affected not only by tillage system, but
   also by the crops chosen for the rotation. When used jointly, tension
   infiltrometers and water release curves can be very useful tools for
   monitoring the evolution of the soils physical conditions. (C) 2010

   an important role in these processes and in the provision of ecosystem
   services, biological soil parameters should be an integral part of soil
   assessment. The general objective of the current study is to investigate
   to what extent biotic soil parameters provide additional value in soil
   quality assessment of grassland on sandy soils. We measured abiotic and
   biotic soil parameters together with process parameters underlying
   ecosystem services in 20 permanent production grasslands.
   Cross-validated stepwise regression was used to identify abiotic and
   biotic soil parameters that explained the soil ecosystem services soil
   structure maintenance, water regulation, supply of nutrients, and
   grassland production, respectively.
   Process parameters underlying the ecosystem service soil structure
   maintenance such as bulk density and the percentage of sub-angular
   blocky elements were mainly influenced by SUM and its qualities. The
   correlations between penetration resistance at 0-10 cm and the
   percentage of soil crumbs with earthworms suggested a relationship to
   earthworm activity. Parameters underlying the service of water
   regulation showed no clear relationship to biotic soil parameters. Water
   infiltration rate in the field was explained by the penetration
   resistance at 10-20 cm. Process parameters underlying the service of
   nutrients' supply such as the potentially mineralizable C and N were
   mainly determined by soil total N. The potential C and N mineralization
   were more related to biotic soil parameters, whereby each parameter was
   the other's antithesis. The grassland production without N fertilization
   viz, the nitrogen supply capacity of the soil measured as N yield, was
   mainly explained by soil organic matter (SOM) and soil moisture, and to
   a lesser extent by soil total N. One gram of SUM per kg of dry soil
   corresponded to 3.21 kg N yield ha(-1), on top of a constant of 15.4 kg
   N ha(-1). The currently applied calculations in the Dutch grassland
   fertilization recommendation, underestimated in 85\% of the production
   grasslands, the measured nitrogen supply capacity of the soil by on
   average 42 kg N ha(-1) (31\%). This legitimizes additional research to
   improve the currently applied recommendations for sandy soils. The
   response of N yield to N fertilization ranged from 35 to 102\%. This
   wide range emphasizes the importance of a better recommendation base to
   target N fertilizer. The response of N yield to N fertilization was
   predicted by the total number of enchytraeids, the underlying mechanism
   of which needs further investigation on different soil types. This
   knowledge can be important for the optimal use of fertilizer and its
   consequences for environmental quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Investigations on soil compaction focused mainly on effects on soil
   physical parameters and on plant growth. Nevertheless, a substantial
   number of papers deal with effects of soil compaction on soil organisms
   (soil fauna, soil microorganisms) and biologically driven processes in
   soils (e.g., macropore formation, respiration rates, N-mineralisation).
   In view of soil and soil functions protection, there is an essential
   need to identify soil compaction threshold values with respect to soil
   biota and soil biological processes. No such values are currently
   available. Thus the aim of our study was to evaluate literature on the
   effects of soil compaction mainly in agricultural soils on soil
   organisms and soil biological processes (e.g., respiration,
   nitrification); to identify relevant parameters which are helpful for
   assessing soil compaction from the soil biological point of view; and to
   find out whether threshold values of soil structure parameters proposed
   by soil physicists correspond to harmful impacts on soil organisms and
   biological processes in soils. Our literature review showed that due to
   the high variability of experimental situations and conditions in the
   evaluated papers, especially in papers describing field investigations,
   no general effect of soil compaction was found. Negative and positive
   effects occurred with slight compaction as well as with strong
   compaction. A verification of the thresholds published to date for soil
   compaction was not possible based on the data evaluated. However, the
   fact that above an effective bulk density of 1.7 g cm(-3), only negative
   effects on microbial biomass and C-mineralisation were found confirms
   this value, proposed by soil physicists, also from the soil biological
   point of view. In order to provide a scientifically meaningful data base
   for the assessment of soil compaction, effects on soil biodiversity,
   related functions and processes, we recommend considering the following
   site and soil properties as essentials: land use, climate, soil type,
   texture, bulk density; soil organic matter content; pH value; soil
   moisture (water content/water tension); pore volume; macroporosity and
   air and/or water conductivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture (CA) systems are based on minimal soil
   disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotation. Although the
   capacity of rotations to break pest and disease cycles is generally
   recognized, other benefits of crop rotations in CA systems are seldom
   acknowledged and little understood. We monitored different conventional
   and CA cropping systems over the period from 2005 to 2009 in a
   multi-seasonal trial in Monze, southern Zambia. Both monocropped maize
   and different maize rotations including cotton and the green manure
   cover crop sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) were compared under CA
   conditions, with the aim of elucidating the effects of crop rotations on
   soil quality soil moisture relations and maize productivity.
   Infiltration, a sensitive indicator of soil quality, was significantly
   lower on conventionally ploughed plots in all cropping seasons compared
   to CA plots. Higher water infiltration rate led to greater soil moisture
   content in CA maize treatments seeded alter cotton. Earthworm
   populations, total carbon and aggregate stability were also
   significantly higher on CA plots. improvements in soil quality resulted
   in higher rainfall use efficiency and higher maize grain yield on CA
   plots especially those in a two- or three-year rotation. lit the 2007/08
   and 2008/2009 season, highest yields were obtained from direct-seeded
   maize after sunnhemp, which yielded 74\% and 136\% more than maize in
   the conventionally ploughed control treatment with a continuous maize
   crop. Even in a two-year rotation (maize-cotton), without a legume green
   manure cover crop, 47\% and 38\% higher maize yields were recorded
   compared to maize in the conventionally ploughed control in the two
   years, respectively This suggests that there are positive effects from
   crop rotations even in the absence of disease and pest problems. The
   overall profitability of each system will, however, depend on markets
   and prices, which will guide the farmer's decision on which, Wally,
   rotation to choose,}},

Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-35}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The potential of agricultural soils to sequester soil organic carbon
   (SOC) is affected by changes in the capacity of the mineral matrix to
   hold and protect SOC that are brought about by agriculture. It is well
   established that microaggregates provide much of the capacity of soils
   to protect SOC. In this study, a loss of the capacity of soils to
   sequester SOC following agriculture was established by comparing samples
   of an Alfisol, in (1) its virgin condition, (2) following relatively
   light treatments for agriculture, (3) following conventional cultivation
   for similar to 120 years, and (4) after 18 years under zero tillage
   following similar to 100 years under conventional cultivation. It
   appears that material has been lost from clay and silt fractions
   relative to sand-size material. Microaggregates in all of the cultivated
   soils studied were less stable to the `chemical hammer' of osmotic
   pressure than those in the virgin soil. The introduction of no-till
   methods did not restore the stability of microaggregates over a period
   of 18 years following similar to 100 years of conventional cultivation.
   Pore size distributions from mercury intrusion showed that cultivation
   always led to a decrease of pore volume in the range of pores between
   0.03 and 100 mu m.
   Transmission electron microscopy showed that a large proportion of
   microaggregates, previously composed of clay and silt-sized particles,
   had disintegrated as a result of conventional soil management over the
   long-term. Surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy and
   photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy both showed that intimate
   associations between fine and coarse material have been broken down by
   intensive soil management practices. The effects on particle size
   distributions by chemical disruption with either or both hydrogen
   peroxide and acid ammonium oxalate, and also with alkaline sodium
   hexametaphosphate, suggested that microaggregates are stabilised by a
   combination of organic matter, poorly ordered minerals and clay
   self-associations, regardless of the agricultural history of the soils.
   Microaggregates appear to be broken down by agriculture through the loss
   of any of these aggregating agents.
   The capacity of soils to form microaggregates will also be affected by
   loss of soil. It appears that both soil, as a whole, and also clay- and
   silt-size material, selectively, has been lost through wind erosion
   following prolonged cultivation. Agriculture has led to a decrease in
   the capacity of the Alfisol to resequester SOC that is effectively
   irreversible by farming practices. Even so, the resilience of the soil
   appeared to be improved by changes in farming practices. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW) is a semisolid sludge generated by
   the olive oil industry. Its recycling as a soil amendment, either
   unprocessed or composted, is being promoted as a beneficial agricultural
   practice in the Mediterranean area. One of the major difficulties when
   composting TPOMW is the compaction of the material due to its dough-like
   texture, which leads to an inadequate aeration. For this reason, the
   addition of bulking agents is particularly important to attain a proper
   composting process. In this study we followed the evolution of two
   composting mixtures (A and B) prepared by mixing equal amounts of TPOMW
   and sheep litter (SL) (in a dry weight basis). In pile B grape stalks
   (GS) were added (10\% dry weight) as bulking agent to study their effect
   on the development of the composting process and the final compost
   quality. The incorporation of grape stalks to the composting mixture
   changed the organic matter (OM) degradation dynamics and notably reduced
   the total amount of lixiviates. The evolution of several maturation
   indices (C/N, germination index, water soluble carbon, humification
   indices, C/N in the leachates) showed a faster and improved composting
   process when GS were added. Moreover, chemical (NH(4) (+), NO(3) (-),
   cation exchange capacity, macro and micronutrients, heavy metals) and
   physical properties (bulk and real densities, air content, total water
   holding capacity, porosity) of the final composts were analysed and

   Macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) constituted 32.5-54.5\% of total water stable

   decrease in the proportion of microaggregates at all the three sampling
   depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm). Macroaggregates had higher C and N
   density as compared to microaggregates. Application of rice straw and
   FYM improved C and N density in different aggregate sizes and the
   improvement was greatest in plots that received both rice straw and FYM
   each year. Application of FYM along with inorganic fertilizer resulted
   in a net C sequestration of 0.44 t ha(-1) in the plough layer after 7

Abstract = {{Soil ecosystem properties and processes which simultaneously maintain
   native fertility and sustain plant yields are of principal interest in
   sustainable agriculture. Native prairies in Kansas are relevant in this
   context, as some have been annually harvested for hay for over 75 years
   with no fertilization or detectable decline in yield or soil fertility.
   In contrast, annual crop production has resulted in significant
   reductions in soil fertility and now requires intensive inputs to
   maintain yields. Soil food webs were compared between hayed native
   grasslands and adjacent annual croplands in order to determine the
   long-term effects of these two production systems on soil ecosystem
   properties. Soil chemical and physical properties, bacterial and
   nematode community structure and abundance were measured across five
   paired sites at six depth intervals to 1 m. Soil organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, and water stable aggregates were all significantly greater in
   perennial grasslands than in annual croplands to a depth of 60 cm.
   Microbial biomass carbon was also greater in grasslands than in
   croplands, and shifts in delta(13)C indicated greater input of new
   carbon at lower depths in grasslands relative to annual croplands.
   Bacterial and nitrogen fixing communities in croplands and grasslands
   were significantly different in the surface 40 cm and nematode community
   differences persisted through 1 m. Nematode community indices suggested
   enhanced fungal decomposition pathways, fewer plant-feeding nematodes,
   and greater food web complexity and stability in grassland soils than in
   annual cropland soils. These data indicate that perennial grasslands in
   Kansas, even when annually harvested for decades, support higher levels
   of soil fertility and structure and more complex biological communities
   than annual cropping systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The freshwater marshes in northern China are heavily impacted by
   anthropogenic disturbances such as cultivation and fertilization and
   increased levels of nutrients (especially N and P) through atmospheric
   deposition and agricultural surface runoff. These disturbances have
   affected the emission of N2O from these systems. This laboratory study
   was conducted to determine the effects of increased inputs of inorganic
   N and P on N2O emission from marsh soil in response to different soil
   moisture conditions. The results showed that the emission of N2O
   increased with the enhancement of N inputs when the soil was submerged,
   but that the highest N treatment suppressed the emission of N2O when the
   soil was at 60\% water holding capacity (WHC), which may have occurred
   due to an inadequate amount of available C. Furthermore, the results of
   this study indicated that a small amount of N fertilizer induced much
   more N2O evolution from freshwater wetland soil, while P fertilizer
   inputs appeared to stimulate the emission of N2O only during the first
   few days of the experiment. Additionally, soil that was treated with P
   appeared to absorb N2O when it was at 60\% WHC after around 6 weeks of
   the incubation, which indicates that the input of P fertilizer might
   serve as a shift of source or N2O sink in wetland soils under
   non-flooded conditions. When compared to soil at 60\% WHC, submerged
   soil had significantly higher N2O emissions, except when subjected to
   the medial N treatment. These findings indicate that the soil moisture
   condition had a significant effect on N2O emissions when the same amount
   of N or P was applied. Therefore, the effects of N and P fertilization
   in the northern temperate wetlands cannot be neglected from regional or
   national emissions of N2O.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbiology is a key factor in soil organic matter decomposition,
   and nutrient turnover and availability in agricultural soils, which can
   be markedly influenced by management practices, such as placement of
   crop residues, tillage and crop rotation. The present field study was
   designed as long-term experiment in an experimental farm located in the
   suburb of Shanghai, China, to study the effects of agricultural
   management practices on community composition of soil fungi and soil
   structure. Treatments included burning (crop residues burnt vs. not
   burnt), tillage (tillage vs. no-tillage) and crop rotation (wheat-corn
   vs. wheat-soybean). The experiment started in June 2001 and soil samples
   were collected in March, July and November 2003, i.e. 2 years after
   establishment. Abundance, diversity and species composition of fungi and
   soil aggregate composition were analyzed. Hypothesis 1 was that
   abundance, species richness and diversity of soil fungi would increase
   in treatments with no-tillage, crop residue retention and wheat-legume
   rotation compared to tillage, burning and wheat-corn rotation, and
   Hypothesis 2 that size-distribution of stable aggregates would increase
   with the diversity of soil fungi. A total of 27 species of fungi of 15
   genera were isolated. As the Hypothesis 1, overall soil fungal species
   richness (6.3 +/- 0.4), diversity (2.2 +/- 0.1) and total species number
   (26) in no-tillage significantly exceeded the species richness (4.4 +/-
   0.3), diversity (1.7 +/- 0.1) and total species number (21) in tillage
   treatments, respectively. However, the effects of tillage depended on
   soil depth and were most pronounced deeper in soil (10-15 cm soil
   depth). The Hypothesis 2 was supported by the results: The content of
   large macro-aggregates (>2000 mu m) (295 +/- 94 g/kg soil) in no-tillage
   treatments significantly exceeded that (99 +/- 25 g/kg soil) in tillage
   treatments in 10-15 cm but not in 0-5 cm soil depth, and coincidentally,
   soil fungal species richness (6.3 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3 +/- 0.1)
   in 10-15 and also the species richness (6.5 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3
   +/- 0.1) in 5-10 cm in no-tillage treatments significantly exceeded the
   species richness (4.2 +/- 0.7) and diversity (1.6 +/- 0.3) in 10-15 cm
   and the species richness (4.3 +/- 0.4) and diversity (1.7 +/- 0.2) in
   5-10 cm in tillage treatments, respectively, but the differences were
   also not in 0-5 cm soil depth. The results suggest that no-tillage
   favours fungi and that a more diverse fungal community beneficially
   affects the formation of large soil macro-aggregates. Further, the
   results indicate that species richness and diversity of cultivable fungi
   are useful and distinctive parameters reflecting the status and
   functioning of the soil fungal community. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   density, organic carbon, porosity, macro pores, and micro pores were
   analyzed. The coefficient of variation indicated low variability for
   soil particles density, bulk density, total and average porosity for the
   variables of macro-and microporosiy, and organic carbon. The variables
   analyzed showed spatial dependence, which was observed in kriging maps.
   The pores distribution by size and total porosity indicate adequate

Abstract = {{The sustainable management of soils has proved a key challenge for the

   + Pigeon Pea; Acacia + Pigeon Pea; Clitoria + Leucaena; Leucaena +
   Acacia and Control treatment (no legumes). We determined chemical and
   physical indicators of soil quality. Leucaena had the highest

   legumes had high Ca (13.82-17.84 g kg(-1)) and very low P (0.51-2.83 g
   kg(-1)) and Mg (1.73-2.92 g kg(-1)) concentrations. Acacia had the
   lowest N, P, K and Mg concentrations. Pre-planting soil analysis
   indicated that soil quality indicators were below the critical levels
   needed for a productive agricultural system, especially for phosphorus,
   sum of bases and base saturation. Physical indicators of quality, such

Abstract = {{Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is the main waste product of the olive oil
   industry and is characterized by a high salinity and high organic matter
   content Until today, in several olive oil producing countries untreated
   OMW is pumped onto agricultural land with possible adverse effects on
   soil properties. The main objective of this study was to investigate the
   long-term effects of OMW application on soil hydrophobicity, hydraulic
   conductivity and infiltration rate In addition, the generation of
   transport patterns was studied using dye tracer tests The results showed
   that the regular application of OMW for 5 and 15 years increased soil
   hydrophobicity and decreased the drainable porosity (Phi <30 mu m), as a
   consequence of a rising organic matter content OMW application
   furthermore reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity compared with a
   control site Likewise, the infiltration rate decreased in the 5 years
   treatment compared with the control The highest infiltration rate,
   however, was observed for the 15 years treatment because of the presence
   of large and deep shrinkage cracks that do not completely close upon
   rewetting. The dye infiltration depth in the control was small and
   homogeneous compared to the plots with OMW application, which fostered
   the generation of heterogeneous flux fields including preferential flow
   conditions As a consequence, fields irrigated with OMW are more prone to
   groundwater contamination with substances either originating from the
   OMW itself or from agricultural chemicals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All

Abstract = {{The role of geomorphology in relation to the spatial and temporal
   distribution of soil carbon is of considerable interest in terms of
   landscape management and carbon sequestration. Soil carbon plays an
   important role in soil water holding capacity, soil structure and
   overall soil health. Soil is also a significant store of terrestrial
   carbon. This study examines total soil carbon (SC) concentration at the
   hillslope and catchment scale in the Tin Camp Creek catchment, Arnhem
   Land, Northern Territory, Australia. The catchment is largely
   undisturbed by European agriculture or management practices and is
   located in the monsoonal tropics. Results show that SC concentration
   along hillslope transects has remained consistent over a number of years
   and it is strongly related to hillslope position and topographic factors
   derived from precision surveying and provides a baseline assessment.
   Poor relationships were found when using a good quality medium
   resolution digital elevation model to derive topographic factors. This
   finding demonstrates the need for high resolution survey data for the
   prediction of total C at the hillslope and catchment scale. There was
   little difference in SC concentration between years and overall, SC down
   the hillslope profile varies little temporally suggesting that
   concentrations are relatively stable in this environment. An assessment
   of the relationship between SC and soil erosion using (137)Cs and
   erosion pins demonstrates that sediment transport and deposition play
   little role in the distribution of SC in this environment. Vegetative
   biomass appears to be the major contributor to SC concentration with
   vegetative biomass being strongly controlled by topographic factors.
   While the SC concentration is constant over the study period further
   sampling is required to assess decadal trends. Crown Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The drainage of low-lying peatland for agriculture and subsequent
   conservation measures adopted on some of these peatlands has led to
   differing degrees of change in the physical and hydraulic
   characteristics of the soil. We assessed the degree of peat
   decomposition and measured the soil organic matter (SOM) content,
   particle density, dry bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity,
   and water retention and shrinkage characteristics for a range of peat
   soil horizons sampled in two low-lying agricultural peatland in England.
   The physical and hydraulic properties of the peats considered were
   significantly influenced by the degree of decomposition. Higher
   decomposition resulted in lower SOM content, higher bulk density and
   lower porosity. In addition, pedogenic alterations due to intensive
   drainage and land use lead to a greater degradation of the soil
   structure in the upper soil layers. Less decomposed peats had a higher
   propensity to shrink under increasing water potentials. They had a lower
   air entry pressure and drained faster than degraded peats. In addition,
   they had a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. This shows that
   decomposition and pedogenic alterations lead to the loss of structural
   pores. Hence decomposition and humification result in the degradation of
   the soil structure and a reduction in the soil capacity to store, retain
   and transmit water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important source of nitrogen (N) for crops is mineralization of soil

   measure of DON, and their relationship with N mineralization. Aerobic
   incubation experiments were conducted in the laboratory for five soils
   at different temperatures (4 20, and 30 degrees C) and different time
   intervals with optimal water content (60\% of its water-holding
   capacity). Net N mineralization ranged between 14 and 155 mg kg-1 within
   84 days and was correlated with the initial amount of EON. Net N
   mineralization among the soils, time, and incubation temperatures was
   linearly related to the square root of time multiplied by temperature,
   with mineralization rate k being independent of time and temperature.
   Because initial EON values were also related to these kvalues, we were
   able to describe the net N mineralization at different temperatures

Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{One of the most prominent applications to increase agricultural yield is
   the application of nitrogenous fertilizers to the soil. The intermediate
   and final products of the mineralization/humidification include carbon
   dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) are released
   into the atmosphere while other final products are cycled into the soil
   upon completion of the related reactions that take place in soil.
   Released CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O are the most notable factors
   responsible for global warming and are claimed to be remarkably serious
   When one accounts for all of the agricultural lands and other similar
   fields all around the globe. In the present study, the impact of
   NH(4)NO(3) with 26\% N, which consisted of 19\% NH(4)-N (ammonium-N) and
   7\% NO(3)-N (nitrate-N), with and without nitrification inhibitor in the
   soil on CH(4), CO(2) and N(2)O gas emissions was monitored in a
   controlled laboratory environment as three parallel experiments. The
   amount of fertilizer applied to the soil layer was 90 kg N per hectare.
   The two treated soils and one control soil were incubated at 60\%
   maximal water holding capacity at 25 degrees C during the test period of
   18 days to investigate, (a) nitrogenous fertilizer (NH(4)NO(3)), (b)
   nitrogenous fertilizer phis nitrification inhibitor (NH(4)NO(3) + N.I.),
   and finally (c) control for CH(4), CO(2), and N(2)O emissions. Gas
   compositions from the experimental soils were sampled at predetermined
   times in order to assess the CH(4) release along with N(2)O and CO(2)
   emissions. Analyses of the headspace on the 1(st), 2(nd), 4(th), 7(th),
   10(th), 14(th) and 18(th) days were completed in order to evaluate gas
   concentrations. The overall results indicate that NH(4)NO(3)
   fertilization and NH(4)NO(3) with a nitrification inhibitor application
   causes a statistically significant decrease in CH(4) emissions and an
   increase in CO(2) emissions into the atmosphere. N(2)O emissions were
   found to be statistically different with the NH(4)NO(3) application and
   control treatments. Yet, no significant change was observed in, the
   N(2)O concentrations with respect to nine, based oil the NH(4)NO(3) with

   the Backward of Black Sea region in Turkey. By selective sampling
   method, samples were collected from three different sites used for
   agriculture, forest and bare space amount of soil samples from each site
   are 16, 26 and 18 respectively. Soil samples were gathered according to
   depth levels of 0-20cm and 20-50cm for each sample plot, and a total of
   280 soil samples disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected
   from four sites at each of the three different land-use types. Sixty
   sample plots were selected from frontier lands with the same aspect in
   the same altitude zone and the same parent material from which soil
   develops. In soil samples, analyses such as particle size distribution
   (sand, silt, clay), soil organic matter (SOM), dispersion ratio (DR),
   erosion ratio (ER), colloid-moisture equivalent ratio (C-MER), clay
   ratio (CR), water holding capacity (WHC), hydraulic conductivity (HC),
   bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), available water capacity (AWC),
   soil pH and total lime (CaCO(3)) were performed for each soil sample.
   The analysis of variance was performed in order to test whether the
   obtained results showed differences according to interaction to land use
   regime and soil depth. The results show that significant differences the
   average erodibility indices (DR, p < 0.05, ER, C-MER, CR, p < 0.001),
   sand (p < 0.01), silt, clay, CaCO(3), SUM (p < 0.001) and soil
   properties such as BD, TP, WHC, HC, pH (p < 0.001) vary according to
   land use regime. The results show that significant differences the
   average DR, BD, TP (p < 0.05) and SUM (p < 0.01) vary according to
   interaction to land use regime and soil depth. As a result, it was
   determined that soils of all three land use types in the dam basin are
   strongly susceptible to erosion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a
   plan for planting the bare areas without effecting the water production
   in a negative way.}},

Title = {{Compost Use in Organic Farming}},
Booktitle = {{GENETIC ENGINEERING, BIOFERTILISATION, SOIL QUALITY AND ORGANIC FARMING}},
Series = {{Sustainable Agriculture Reviews}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{311-345}},
Abstract = {{Organic farming is a sustainable agricultural system that respects and
   relies on natural ecological systems. Its principles exclude the use of
   synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Instead it is based on management
   practices that sustain soil quality and health. Composting of organic
   residues and the use of compost in agriculture bring back plant
   nutrients and organic matter to the soil that otherwise would be lost.
   Nevertheless, there are some potential risks associated with compost
   use, such as the accumulation of heavy metals or organic pollutants,
   which must not be neglected.
   Some types of organic farms, such as stockless farms or vegetable farms,
   have difficulties sustaining soil humus using only organic farming
   sources. For such farms, using biowaste compost from separately
   collected organic household waste might be a solution, which in addition
   helps to close nutrient and organic matter loops of the whole society.
   Here we compile information on beneficial effects and potential risks
   associated with compost use and on crop yields and quality, with compost
   under an organic farming perspective.
   The most important benefit of using compost is the increase in soil
   organic matter (SOM). Under temperate climate conditions, 6-7 t ha(-1)
   year(-1) (dry wt.) compost is sufficient to maintain the soil humus
   level of medium-textured soils; higher rates increase the soil humus
   content. Regular compost addition enhances soil fauna and soil microbial
   biomass and stimulates enzyme activity, leading to increased
   mineralization of organic matter and improved resistance against pests
   and diseases, both features essential for organic farming. Through the
   significant increase in the soil's content of organic carbon, compost
   fertilization may make agricultural soil a carbon sink and thus
   contribute to the mitigation of the greenhouse effect.
   Phosphorus and potassium in compost become nearly completely
   plant-available within a few years after compost application. The
   nitrogen-fertilizer value of compost is lower. In the first years of
   compost application, N mineralization may vary from -15\% to +15\%.
   Nitrogen recovery in the following years depends on the site- and
   cultivation-specific mineralization characteristics and will roughly be
   the same as that of soil organic matter (SOM).
   Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) increases with compost use,
   improving nutrient availability. Moderate rates of compost of 6-7 t
   ha(-1) year(-1) dry wt. are sufficient to substitute regular soil
   liming. In the available micronutrient status of the soil, only minor
   changes are to be expected with high-quality composts. Increasing soil
   organic matter exerts a substantial influence on soil structure,
   improving soil physical characteristics such as aggregate stability,
   bulk density, porosity, available water capacity, and infiltration.
   Increased available water capacity may protect crops against drought
   stress.
   Plant-disease suppression through compost is well established in
   container systems. In field systems, the same processes involving the
   suppression of pathogens by a highly active microflora supported by the
   supply of appropriate organic matter are likely at work.
   When using high-quality composts, such as specified by the EU regulation
   2092/91, the risk of heavy metal accumulation in the soil is very low.
   Nitrogen mineralization from compost takes place relatively slowly and
   there are virtually no reports of uncontrollable N-leaching.
   Concentrations of persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or
   polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) in
   high-quality composts usually approach the usual soil background values.
   Also the overall hygiene and hygiene concerning plant diseases and weeds
   are not a problem if quality composts produced in a monitored system are
   used.
   Most studies found positive yield effects of biowaste compost. However,
   the effect of biowaste compost applied at moderate rates usually takes
   some years to develop. It depends on the factors determining nutrient
   mineralization from soil and compost and also on crop-related factors
   such as the nutrient requirements and uptake dynamics of the respective
   crop rotation. Crops with longer growth periods can make better use of
   compost. Many vegetable crops respond favorably to compost
   fertilization, often immediately after the first application. Crop
   quality is usually not affected by compost fertilization in cereals and
   slightly positively influenced in vegetable crops.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture is one of the fundamental variables in hydrology,
   meteorology and agriculture. Nevertheless, its spatio-temporal patterns
   in agriculturally used landscapes that are affected by multiple natural
   (rainfall, soil, topography etc.) and agronomic (fertilisation, soil
   management etc.) factors are often not well known. The aim of this study
   is to determine the dominant factors governing the spatio-temporal
   patterns of surface soil moisture in a grassland and an arable test site
   that are located within the Rur catchment in Western Germany. Surface
   soil moisture (0-6 cm) was measured in an approx. 50x50 m grid during 14
   and 17 measurement campaigns (May 2007 to November 2008) in both test
   sites. To analyse the spatio-temporal patterns of surface soil moisture,
   an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was applied and the
   results were correlated with parameters derived from topography, soil,
   vegetation and land management to link the patterns to related factors
   and processes. For the grassland test site, the analysis resulted in one
   significant spatial structure (first EOF), which explained 57.5\% of the
   spatial variability connected to soil properties and topography. The
   statistical weight of the first spatial EOF is stronger on wet days. The
   highest temporal variability can be found in locations with a high
   percentage of soil organic carbon (SOC). For the arable test site, the
   analysis resulted in two significant spatial structures, the first EOF,
   which explained 38.4\% of the spatial variability, and showed a highly
   significant correlation to soil properties, namely soil texture and soil
   stone content. The second EOF, which explained 28.3\% of the spatial
   variability, is linked to differences in land management. The soil
   moisture in the arable test site varied more strongly during dry and wet
   periods at locations with low porosity. The method applied is capable of
   identifying the dominant parameters controlling spatio-temporal patterns
   of surface soil moisture without being affected by single random
   processes, even in intensively managed agricultural areas.}},

   soils under forest and in Ultisols. In forest and agriculture land use,
   soil silt+clay content was an important determinant for C storage in the

   soil mass in large macroaggregates (> 2,000 mu m) relative to that in
   forest soils, whereas Ultisols had greater soil mass percentage in large

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural land use such is the establishment of prairies
   on previously cultivated cropland provide an opportunity for greater
   soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates. In this study, a topo-
   and chrono-sequence approach was used to investigate relationships
   between SOC and soil aggregate formation. Our hypothesis was that the
   greatest increases in SOC sequestration rates are associated with most
   recently established prairies oil cultivated land, where SOC was the
   most depleted, due to the destruction of soil aggregate. The study was
   conducted in Jasper and Warren counties in Iowa, from 2005 to 2008.
   Soils in both Counties were formed in loess under native vegetation of
   tallgrass prairie. There were three reconstructed prairie sites varying
   in establishment year-1993, 1998, 2003; a row crop production site
   tinder no-tillage; and a prairie remnant site. All soil and plant
   sampling plots were located on summit, midslope, and toe-slope
   positions. Results show that time since establishment and slope position
   had a significant impact on SOC sequestration rates in the top 15 cm (6
   in) soil depth only. In the summit position, the greatest SOC
   sequestration rates were observed in the youngest prairie at 2.15 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1) (0.96 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)), and decreased to near equilibrium
   after approximately eight years. Additionally, SOC was shown to increase
   linearly at a rate of 0.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.33 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)) since
   prairie establishment during the 14-year period. In the toe-slope
   position, SOC sequestration rates were substantially lower at 0.59 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1) (0.26 m ac(-1) yr(-1)). Furthermore, increases in SOC
   sequestration rates coincided with increases in water stable
   aggregate-associated carbon (C) in 0.25 to 2 mm (0.01 to 0.08 in) size
   fractions. This occurred in the youngest reconstructed prairie (2003) in
   the summit and in the midslope positions on prairies reconstructed in
   1998 and 1993. This suggests that the mechanisms of soil aggregate
   formation aid in stabilizing SOC, which is significantly affected by
   slope position and years since prairie establishment.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion and soil compaction are two important degradation processes of
   modern agricultural production in Western Europe. One of the principal
   causes of soil degradation are deep and intensive tillage operations,
   especially under moist soil conditions. To minimize erosion and soil
   compaction, the adoption of conservation tillage or reduced tillage (RT)
   agriculture is widely recognized. However, crop rotations in Western
   Europe often include root crops that are generally assumed to be less
   suitable under RT agriculture because they result in a high disturbance
   of the soil at the formation of the ridges and at harvest. A detailed
   understanding of the influence of the different types of tillage on the
   soil properties aggregate stability, penetration resistance (PR) and
   field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) is important for management
   strategies. The objective of this chapter is comparing the physical
   properties of silt loam soils under different tillage systems in Belgian
   fields.
   The aggregate stability of the 0-10 cm layer was measured in the
   laboratory. The stability index measured by the `dry and wet sieving'
   method of De Leenheer and De Boodt (1959) was 40\% higher under RT than
   conventional tillage (CT) agriculture. The mean weight diameter (MWD)
   measured with the three methods of Le Bissonnais (1996) was
   significantly higher even after short-term RT compared to CT
   agriculture. The MWD after a heavy shower, a slow wetting and stirring
   the soil after prewetting was 19\%, 38\% and 34\% higher for RT than CT
   fields, respectively. The PR was studied in the field with a hand
   penetrologger. The PR of fields under RT was higher in the first layers
   due to less (RT with cultivator or soil loosener {[}=RTC]) or no
   disturbance (RT by direct drilling {[}=RTDD]) of the soil structure. The
   crop growth of RTC fields seemed not to be affected by this superficial
   compaction. However, the crop growth of RTDD fields was lower than of CT
   fields. The PR measurements indicated a plough pan at depth in some
   field under CT. The measurement of the infiltration rate with a Guelph
   pressure infiltrometer in the field showed that Kfs tended to be lower
   under CT than the other types of tillage.
   We can conclude that RTC is a form of agriculture that is more
   sustainable than CT agriculture in these silt loam soils. This research
   indicated that short term RTDD agriculture under crop rotations with
   root crops often result in a lower crop yield, which is probably
   correlated with the higher PR in the 10-30 cm depth layer. Therefore,
   the potential of RTDD agriculture in Western Europe is probably limited.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation that results from erosion, losses of organic matter and
   nutrients, or soil compaction are of great concern in every agricultural
   region of the world. The control of soil erosion and loss of organic
   matter has been proposed as critical to agricultural and environmental
   sustainability of Northeast China. This region is bread basket of China
   where the fertile and productive soils, Mollisols (also called Black
   soils), are primarily distributed. In this paper, we introduce the
   importance of Northeast China's grain production to China, and describe
   the changes of sown acreage and grain production in past decades. This
   paper also summarizes the distribution, area and intensity of water
   erosion, changes in the number of gullies and gully density, thickness
   of top soil layer, soil organic matter content, bulk density, field
   water holding capacity, and infiltration rates; the number of soil
   microorganism and main enzyme activities from soil erosion in the region
   are also summarized. The moderately and severely water-eroded area
   accounted for 31.4\% and 7.9\% of the total, and annual declining rate
   is 1.8\%. Erosion rate is 1.24-2.41 mm/year, and soil loss in 1 degrees,
   5 degrees and 15 degrees sloping farmlands is 3 t/ha/year, 78 t/ha/year
   and 220.5 t/ha/year, respectively. SOC content of uncultivated soil was
   nearly twice that of soil with a 50-year cultivation history, and the
   average annual declining rate of soil organic matter was 0.5\%. Proper
   adoption of crop rotation can increase or maintain the quantity and
   quality of soil organic matter, and improve soil chemical and physical
   properties. Proposed strategies for erosion control, in particular how
   tillage management, terraces and strip cultivation, or soil amendments
   contribute to maintain or restore the productivity of severely eroded
   farmland, are discussed in the context of agricultural sustainability
   with an emphasis on the Chinese Mollisols.}},

   properties were analyzed: soil density, porosity, aggregate stability,
   degree of flocculation, water retention, infiltration, mechanical
   strength, and total organic carbon. Soil aggregation in the surface
   layer (0-5 cm) was better in the no-tillage than the conventional
   system, related to higher microporosity, organic carbon contents and
   water retention capacity, indicating that a periodical tillage of this
   soil is unnecessary. Infiltration was highest in no-tillage with crop

Abstract = {{To develop better management practices that optimize the N derived front
   manure, additional research is needed regarding the mineralization and
   dynamics of N under field conditions. Thus, an in situ field study using
   three different soil types located in an agricultural field was
   conducted to evaluate-N mineralization patterns during the summer and
   winter months. The three Coastal Plain soils (Ultisols) investigated
   were Bama (sandy loam), Lynchburg (loam), and Goldsboro (loam),
   representing the landscape position of a summit, drainageway, and
   sideslope, respectively. Composted dairy Manure was incorporated into in
   situ soil cores, at a rate of 350 kg N ha(-1), to evaluate
   mineralization rates of the soils and their landscape position during
   the summer and winter months. Addition of composted dairy manure on N
   mineralization was impacted by season and soil type. This was most
   evident during summer months (N mineralization was 24\%), suggesting
   that seasonal timing of application will influence mineralization. The
   seasonal patterns of N mineralization were affected mostly by
   temperature; N mineralization was minimal during winter (N
   mineralization was 2\%) when temperature was low (similar to 10 degrees
   C) but was greater during summer with higher temperatures (25 degrees
   C-30 degrees C). Landscape and soil texture played an additional role in
   mineralization. The soil type with the greatest percentage of sand and
   located in a low-lying area, although N mineralization was low during
   the winter months, significantly lost more of the added N from dairy
   compost (80\%-90\% more) compared with the other soils. During the
   summer, the loam soil with the greatest water-holding capacity
   mineralized the most N, significantly mineralizing 9\% to 10\% more than
   the other soils. These results show that soil variability, temperature,
   and landscapes need to be considered when applying manure to
   agricultural fields.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural waste, such as sago waste (SW), is one of the sources of
   pollution to streams and rivers in Sarawak, particularly those situated
   near sago processing plants. In addition, unbalanced and excessive use
   of chemical fertilizers can cause soil and water pollution. Humic
   substances can be used as organic fertilizers, which reduce pollution.
   The objectives of this study were to produce K- and ammonium-based
   organic fertilizer from composted SW and to determine the efficiency of
   the organic-based fertilizer produced. Humic substances were isolated
   using standard procedures. Liquid fertilizers were formulated except for
   T2 (NPK fertilizer), which was in solid form. There were six treatments
   with three replications. Organic fertilizers were applied to soil in
   pots on the 10th day after sowing (DAS), but on the 28th DAS, only
   plants of T2 were fertilized. The plant samples were harvested on the
   57th DAS during the tassel stage. The dry matter of plant parts (leaves,
   stems, and roots) were determined and analyzed for N, P, and K using
   standard procedures. Soil of every treatment was also analyzed for
   exchangeable K, Ca, Mg, and Na, organic matter, organic carbon,
   available P, pH, total N, P, nitrate and ammonium contents using
   standard procedures. Treatments with humin (T5 and T6) showed remarkable
   results on dry matter production; N, P, and K contents; their uptake; as
   well as their use efficiency by maize. The inclusion of humin might have
   loosened the soil and increased the soil porosity, hence the better
   growth of the plants. Humin plus inorganic fertilizer provided
   additional nutrients for the plants. The addition of inorganic
   fertilizer into compost is a combination of quick and slow release
   sources, which supplies N throughout the crop growth period. Common
   fertilization by surface application of T2 without any additives (acidic
   and high CEC materials) causes N and K to be easily lost. High Ca in the
   soil may have reacted with phosphate from fertilizer to form Ca
   phosphate, an insoluble compound of phosphate that is generally not
   available to plants, especially roots. Mixing soil with humin produced
   from composted SW before application of fertilizers (T5 and T6)
   significantly increased maize dry matter production and nutrient use
   efficiency. Additionally, this practice does not only improve N, P, and
   K use efficiency, but it also helps to reduce the use of N-, P-, and
   K-based fertilizers by 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional tillage is not only high energy and labour consuming
   process, but it can also have a negative impact on soil properties. The
   objective of this study was to determine the influence of different

   shallow ploughing (SP) at 10-12 cm depth, shallow loosening with a
   chisel cultivator and disc harrows (SL) at 8-10 cm depth, shallow
   loosening with a rotary cultivator (SR) at 5-6 cm depth, shallow green
   manure (red clover and timothy catch crop) incorporation with a rotary
   cultivator (GMR) at 5-6 cm depth and no-tillage (NT) on soil bulk
   density, penetration resistance, aggregate size distribution and
   earthworms. The experiment was carried out in two backgrounds: straw
   removed (N) or straw chopped and spread at harvesting (S). A long-term
   two-factorial field experiment was carried out at the experimental
   station of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture at 54 degrees 52'50
   N latitude and 23 degrees 49'41 E longitude. The soil of the trial site
   was an Calc(ar)i-Endohypogleyic Luvisol (LVg-n-w-cc), clay loam on sandy
   light loam, with a pF(KCI) of 7.6, humus content of 28.6 g kg(-1), K(2)O
   - 134 mg kg(-1), and P(2)O(5) - 266 mg kg(-1). Straw incorporation had
   no significant influence on bulk density, penetration resistance and
   quantity of earthworms, but significantly reduced the amount of the
   smallest <0.25 mm aggregates. No significant differences of bulk density
   vs. CP were obtained in reduced autumn tillage - SP, and SL, while in
   reduced spring tillage systems - SR, GMR and NT significant changes were
   observed only in the first year of experiment at 3-13 cm depth. Soil
   penetration resistance increased in undisturbed soil layers. In SP it
   increased from 12 cm depth, in SL from 9 cm depth and in SR and GM R
   from 6 cm depth, while in NT it became higher from the very soil
   surface. SR, GMR and NT increased the number and biomass of earthworms
   and decreased the amount of the smallest <0.25 mm soil aggregates.
   Significant differences in soil aggregate size distribution and
   stability were found already in the first year. Reduced and no-tillage
   significantly increased the amount of water stable aggregates in both
   0-15 cm and 15-25 cm soil layers compared to deep ploughing.}},

Abstract = {{Organic wastes addition may impact the pesticide behaviour in soils.
   Furthermore the incorporation of crop residues or organic amendments by
   ploughing can induce a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the added

   of soil microorganisms and isoproturon biodegradation was investigated
   at the decimetric scale in relation to the spatial distribution of
   organic matter originating from urban waste composts from 1 to 19 months
   after their incorporation through ploughing. We compared one control
   plot without compost addition and two plots receiving either municipal
   solid waste (MSW) compost or green waste co-composted with sewage sludge
   (SGW) every two years. According to morphological description, the
   ploughed layer was divided into four zones: the interfurrows, containing
   important quantities of fresh organic matter, the plough pan and two
   types of clods, the Delta clods (with no visible structural porosity)
   and the Gamma clods (with visible macropores). Total organic carbon (C)
   and microbial and fungal biomasses were measured on homogeneous samples
   taken from each zone. Total C and isoproturon mineralization were
   monitored for two months at 2 sampling dates. At the end of incubation,
   samples were extracted to evaluate the nature and availability of
   isoproturon residues. The results showed that interfurrows constituted a
   special local environment with the highest level of microbial biomass
   and the highest isoproturon mineralizing capacities and respiration
   levels. The presence of compost in the interfurrows stimulated
   isoproturon biodegradation relative to controls. This effect was more
   pronounced for the MSW compost than for the SGW compost. Heterogeneity
   may persist several months after compost or stubble hiding depending on

Abstract = {{The emission of CO2 from Galician (NW Spain) forest, grassland and
   cropped soils was studied in a laboratory experiment, at different
   temperatures (10-35 degrees C) and at moisture contents of 100\% and
   160\% of the field capacity (FC) of each soil (the latter value
   corresponds to saturated conditions, and represents between 120\% and
   140\% of the water holding capacity, depending on the soil). In the
   forest soil, respiration in the flooded samples at all temperatures was
   lower than that at 100\% field capacity. In the agricultural (grassland
   and cropped) soils the emission was higher (particularly at the highest
   incubation temperatures) in the soils wetted to 160\% of the field
   capacity than in those wetted to 100\% of the field capacity. In all
   cases the emission followed first order kinetics and the mineralization
   constants increased exponentially with temperature. In the forest soil,
   the Q(10) values were almost the same in the soils incubated at the two
   moisture contents. The grassland and cropped soils displayed different
   responses, as the Q(10) values were higher in the soils at 160\% than in
   those at 100\% of field capacity. In addition, and particularly at the
   highest temperatures, the rate of respiration increased sharply 9 and 17
   days after the start of the incubation in the grassland and in the
   cropped soil, respectively. The above-mentioned anomalous response of
   the grassland and cropped soils under flooding conditions may be related
   to the agricultural use of the soils and possibly to the intense use of
   organic fertilizers in these soils (more than 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)
   added as cattle slurry or manure, respectively, in the grassland and
   cropped soils). The observed increase in respiration may either be
   related to the development of thermophilic facultative anaerobic
   microbes or to the formation during the incubation period of a readily
   metabolizable substrate, possibly originating from the remains of
   organic fertilizers, made accessible by physicochemical processes that
   occurred during incubation under conditions of high moisture. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Many soils in the semiarid Mediterranean Ebro Valley of Spain are prone
   to physical and chemical degradation due to their silty texture, low
   organic matter content, and presence of carbonates, gypsum or other
   soluble salts. Rainfed agriculture on these soils is also hindered by
   the scarcity of water. No-tillage can increase plant-available water and
   soil organic matter, thus helping overcome most factors limiting crop
   production in this area. Our objective was to determine how
   conventional- and no-tillage practices affected soil physical quality
   indicators and water availability in an on-farm study in the Ebro
   Valley. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 5-, 5 to 15-, and 15 to
   30-cm depth increments within adjacent farmer-managed conventional- and
   no-tillage fields in 2007 and 2008. Both fields were managed for
   continuous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) production. The soil at both
   sites is a silt loam (Haplic Calcisol). Aggregate-size distribution and
   stability, soil water retention characteristics, organic carbon, and
   total carbonates were determined in 2007. Pore-size distribution was
   estimated from the water retention curve. Penetration resistance, soil
   bulk density and field water content during the entire crop growing
   season were measured for both fields in 2008. Aggregate dry mean weight
   diameter and stability in water were 1.2 and 2.2 times greater,
   respectively, under no-tillage than conventional tillage due to reduced
   mechanical disturbance and increased soil organic carbon content. Bulk
   density was 1.12 times greater (P < 0.1) under no-tillage only in the
   0-5-cm depth. Two times greater penetration resistance to a depth of 15
   cm in this treatment was related to bulk density and aggregates
   stability. Field water content was greater with no-tillage than
   conventional tillage during the driest months in 2008. The volume of
   equivalent diameter pores (0.2-9 mu m) was 1.5 times higher under
   no-tillage. This increased plant-available water content and doubled
   barley production under no-tillage in 2008, which was a very dry year.
   We conclude that despite the greater penetration resistance under
   no-tillage, increased water availability as a result of improved
   structure characteristics was more important for crop yield. This
   suggests that producers should seriously consider adopting no-tillage
   practices for soil conservation in semiarid degraded areas like the one
   studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the objectives of more rational use of the soil and greater protection
   against the erosion. However, through till, any of it, occurs
   modifications of the soil's structure. This current work aims to study
   the influence of the energy state of the water and of the organic matter
   on the mechanism of compaction of Red Oxisol under no-till management
   system. Humid and non-deformed sample were collected in horizon AP of
   two agricultural areas under no-till, with and without rotation of
   cultures. In the laboratory, these samples were broken into fragments
   and sifted to obtain aggregates of 4 to 5 mm sized, which were placed in
   equilibrium under four matrix potentials. Thereafter, they were exposed
   to uni-dimensional compression with pressures varying from 32 to 1,000
   kPa. The results in such a way show that the highest compressibility of
   aggregates both for the tilling with rotation of cultures as for the
   tilling without rotation of cultures, occurred for matrix potential -32
   kPa (humidity of 0.29-0.32 kg kg(-1), respectively), while the minor
   occurred for the potentials of -1 and -1,000 kPa (humidity of 0.35 and

   worked with humidity ranging around 0.29 to 0.32 kg kg(-1) and the
   highest reduction of volume of aggregates was obtained for the
   mechanical pressures lower than 600 inferior kPa, indicating that these
   soils showed to be very influenced by compression, when exposed to
   mechanical work. Also, the aggregates of soil under no-till and rotation
   of crops presented higher sensitivity to the compression than the
   aggregates of soil under no-till and without rotation of crops, possibly
   for having better structural conditions given to a higher content of
   organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Soil aggregation is influenced by the tillage system used, which in turn
   affects the amount of C and N in the different aggregate fractions. This
   study assessed the impact of different tillage systems on soil
   aggregates by measuring the aggregate stability, the organic carbon
   (C(org)) and the total nitrogen (N(tot)) contents within different
   aggregate fractions, and their release of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC). Soil samples were collected from the top 0 to 10 cm of a
   long-term tillage experiment at Fuchsenbigl (Marchfeld, Austria) where
   conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and minimum tillage
   (MT) treatments were applied to a Chernozem fine sandy loam. The stable
   aggregates (1000-2000 mu m) were subject to dispersion by the soil
   aggregate stability (SAS or wet sieving) method after Kemper and Rosenau
   (1986), and the ultrasonic method of Mayer et al. (2002). Chemical
   analysis of the soil was obtained for the aggregate fractions 630-1000,
   250-630 and 63-250 mu m gathered from the ultrasonic method. Using the
   SAS method, CT and RT had the least amounts of stable aggregates (18.2\%
   and 18.9\%, respectively), whereas MT had twice as much stable
   aggregates (37.6\%). Using the ultrasonic method, MT also had the
   highest amount of water stable aggregates in all three fractions (1.5\%,
   3.7\%, and 35\%, respectively), followed by RT (1\%, 2.3\%, 32.3\%), and
   CT (0.8\%, 1.7\%, 29.1\%). For comparison, a reference soil, EUROSOIL 7
   (ES-7) was also analysed (40\%, 6.7\%, and 12.1\%). The highest amounts
   of C(org) and N(tot) were measured under MT in all three fractions, with
   8.9\%, 3.8\%, and 1.3\% for C(org), and 0.4\%, 0.3\%, and 0.1\% for
   N(tot). Apart from the fraction 630-1000 mu m, the aggregates of RT and
   CT contained <50\% of the C(org) and N(tot) values of MT. The C/N ratio
   was least favourable for CT (42.6) in the aggregate fraction 630-1000 mu
   m. The DOC release from stable aggregates after 10 min of ultrasonic
   dispersion was highest from MT soil (86.7 mg l(-1)). The values for RT
   and CT were 21\% and 25\% below this value. The results demonstrate that
   tillage type influences both aggregate stability and aggregate chemical
   composition. This research confirms that CT interferes more with the
   natural soil properties than RT and MT. Furthermore, MT has the highest
   potential to sequester C and N in this agriculturally used soil. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil degradation associated with tillage is a major problem in Uruguayan
   agriculture. Either rotation of crops with pastures (ROT) or no-till
   (NT) cropping have been proposed as alternatives to minimize the impact
   of agriculture on soil quality. The combined impact on soil properties
   of ROT and NT has not been evaluated. In this study, we report results
   of the first 12 years of a long-term experiment established on a clay
   loam soil in western Uruguay. The objective was to determine the
   influence of conventional tillage (CT) and NT on systems under
   continuous cropping (CC, two crops per year) or ROT (3.5-year annual
   crops/2.5-year pastures). Soil samples taken at the beginning of the
   experiment in 1994 and in 2004 were analyzed for organic carbon (SOC),
   total organic carbon (TSOC) and total nitrogen content (STN), and for
   water-stable aggregation (WAS). Soil loss and erodibility indicators
   were studied using microrain simulator. With 12 years, the cumulative
   carbon (C) inputs of aboveground biomass were similar between tillage,
   but C input in CC was 50\% higher than ROT. This difference was
   explained because 84\% of the pastures dry matter was consumed by
   animals. Nevertheless we estimated a higher below ground biomass in ROT
   compared to CC systems (24.9 Mg ha(-1) vs. 10.9 Mg ha(-1)). NT presented
   7\% higher SOC than CT (0-18 cm) with no differences between rotation
   systems. While all treatments declined in STN during 12 years, ROT had
   11\% and 58\% higher STN and WAS than CC systems, with a large impact of
   the pasture under CT. Runoff and erosion were minimized under NT in both
   rotations systems. Thus, including pastures in the rotation, or
   switching from CT to NT improved soil quality properties. The expected
   benefit of combining NT and ROT will likely require more years for the
   cumulative effect to be detectable in both C input and soil properties.

   study the effect of planting methods, sources and levels of nitrogen on
   soil properties, yield and NPK uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L) under
   direct seeded condition. Planting methods significantly influenced the
   physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. Bulk density
   (1.385 g cm(-3)), organic carbon (0.43\%) and soil moisture content
   (15.46\%) were higher in zero till seeding plots than rotavator and

   was controlled by the addition of organic residues and application of
   one wetting and drying event after organic amendment increased large

   small water stable macroaggregates (0.25-2.00 mm) was not enhanced by
   the organic addition, but was affected by wetting and drying and time.
   Unamended soil under wetting and drying showed an increase of 20\% in

   These results provided much needed information on the differences in the

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices mostly influence methane (CH(4)) emissions from
   rice field, which must be controlled for maintaining the ecosystem
   balance. No-tillage farming with chemical amendments having electron
   acceptors could be an effective mitigation strategy in CH(4) emissions
   from irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. An experiment was conducted
   in Korean paddy field under tillage and no-tillage farming practices
   with silicate iron slag amendments (1-4 Mg ha(-1)) for suppressing CH(4)
   emissions and maintaining rice productivity. It was found that CH(4)
   emissions from the no-tillage rice field significantly decreased as
   compared to that of tilled field, irrespective of silicate amendments.
   The total seasonal CH(4) flux from the control tillage and control
   no-tillage plots were recorded 38.1 and 27.9 g m(-2), respectively,
   which were decreased by 20\% and 36\% with 4 Mg ha(-1) silicate
   amendment. Silicate fertilization (4 Mg ha(-1)) with no-tillage system
   decreased total seasonal CH(4) flux by 54\% as compared to that of
   control tillage plot. This is most likely due to the higher
   concentrations of active iron and free iron oxides in the no-tilled rice
   field as compared to that of tilled field under silicate fertilization,
   which acted as electron acceptors and contributed to decrease CH(4)
   emission. In addition, the improved soil porosity and redox potential,
   rice plant growth parameters such as active tillering rate, root volume
   and porosity, etc. in combination increased the rhizosphere oxygen
   concentrations and eventually suppressed CH(4) emission during the rice
   growing season. The leaf photosynthetic rate was significantly increased
   with 4 Mg ha(-1) silicate amendment, which ultimately increased grain
   yield by 18\% and 13\% in the tilled and no-tilled rice field,
   respectively. CH(4) flux showed a strong positive correlation with the

   correlations with soil porosity, soil pH, soil Eh, and the content of

Abstract = {{Soil compost application is a common soil management practice used by
   small farmers of Central-South Chile that produces positive effects on
   soil properties and also promotes presence and activity of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This fungi form symbiosis with plant roots
   improving plant nutrition, as well as producing glomalin, a glycoprotein
   that has been associated with soil aggregation stability. Therefore, the
   aim of this study was to evaluate, in an Ultisol from Central-South
   Chile, the effect of different doses of compost on some soil
   characteristics at the end of the third year of a crop sequence
   including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),
   and grassland (Lolium multiflorum Lam. associated with Trifolium repens
   L.). Studied soil characteristics included chemical (pH, available-P,
   organic C), biological (C and N biomass, AMF spore number, root
   colonization percentage, mycelium length, and glomalin content), as well
   as physical parameters (water holding capacity {[}WHC], and water stable
   aggregates {[}WSA]). Results showed that, in general, compost
   application increased soil pH, mycorrizal roots, mycelium length,
   glomalin levels, and WSA. Significant relationships were found between C
   and N biomass, C biomass and WSA, C biomass and glomalin, WSA and WHC,

Abstract = {{Soil compaction is widespread but tends to be most prevalent where heavy
   machinery is used in landfill sites, agriculture and forestry. Three
   forest sites strongly disturbed by heavy logging machinery were chosen
   to test the physical effects of different levels of compaction on soil
   bacterial community structure and soil functions. Community analysis
   comprised microbial biomass C and T-RFLP genetic profiling. Machine
   passes, irrespective of the compaction level, considerably modified soil
   structural characteristics at two soil depths (5-10 cm; 15-20 cm). Total
   porosity decreased up to 17\% in the severe compaction. Reflected in
   this overall decline were large decreases in macroporosity (>50 mu m).
   Reduction in macroporosity was associated with higher water retention
   and restricted gas exchange in compacted soils. The strongest effect was
   observed in the severely compacted wheel tracks where air and water
   conductivities were reduced permanently to 10\% or even lower of the
   original conductivities of undisturbed soils. Very slow drainage in
   combination with a dramatically reduced gas permeability led to
   unfavorable soil conditions in severely disturbed traffic lanes
   reflecting the changes in the total bacterial community structures at
   both soil depths. Additionally, microbial biomass C tended to be lower
   in compacted soil. Our results indicate that the type of severe

Abstract = {{Soil from cleaning and washing of sugar beet during processing is

   to reuse the sediment for crop growth. The physical and mechanical
   properties of the non-structured washed soil (WS) and the efficiency of
   added organic matter (peat and green waste compost) were evaluated by
   comparison with an arable silt loam soil (AS). Water retention data were
   expressed in a double-exponential function which characterized soil
   structural and matrix pore space. The effects on saturated hydraulic
   conductivity and pore space morphology from applying loads of 60 and 200
   kPa on two initial volumetric water contents (12 and 25\%) were
   investigated using image analysis. WS was a silt loam with no
   plasticity, and its void ratio and water retention were higher than the
   AS before compression. However, WS had a very small amount of structural
   pore space and despite its higher void ratio, its hydraulic conductivity
   was always lower than AS after compression. Organic matter improved all
   the WS properties by increasing structural porosity and vertical stress
   resistance. Organic matter created elongated and tortuous pores and
   increased K(s) values by changing pore size distribution. During
   compression large pores with a radius > 1500 mu m disappeared in WS
   mixtures but were still observed in AS and were maintained by aggregate
   stability.}},

   21.4\%, total N by 31.8\% and Olsen's P by 34.5\% in the 0-5 cm layer
   compared to traditional tillage. Mean percentage of macro-aggregates (>
   0.25 mm, +20\%) and macroporosity (> 60 mu m, +52.1\%) also improved
   significantly in the 0-30 cm soil layer (P < 0.05). The largest yield
   improvements coupled with greatest water use efficiency (WUE) were
   achieved by no-tillage with straw cover. Ten-year mean crop yields
   increased by 14.0\% and WUE improved by 13.5\% compared to traditional
   tillage due to greater soil moisture and improved soil physical and
   chemical status. These improvements in soil properties and productivity
   are of considerable importance for the seriously degraded soils in
   semiarid Inner Mongolia, as well as for food security, sustainable
   agriculture and carbon storage in the farming-pasture transition regions
   of China.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of water-stable aggregates (WSA) and a diverse microbial
   activity influence soil quality, crop growth, nutrient retention, water
   infiltration, and surface runoff. The objective of the study was to test
   the hypothesis that permanent vegetative buffers increase WSA and
   contribute to increased soil enzyme activity. Soil samples (5 cm
   diameter and 10 cm long) from agroforestry (AG), grass buffer (GIB),
   grass waterway (GWW) and crop (CS) areas were collected from summit,
   middle, and lower landscape positions at the Paired Watershed Study,
   near Novelty, MO. Water-stable aggregates (>250 mu m diameter;
   wet-sieving method), soil carbon, and soil enzyme activity were
   determined and data were statistically analyzed. Soils under permanent
   vegetative buffers and GWW had significantly lower bulk density and more
   WSA than the crop areas. Soil carbon contents were highest in the GWW
   and lowest in the CS treatments. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase,
   beta-glucosidase, and glucosaminadase enzyme activities were higher in
   AG, GB, and GWW soils than CS soils. Dehydrogenase activity differed
   between grass buffer or GWW and crop areas. The results of the study
   show that WSA, soil carbon, and functional diversity of enzyme activity
   increased due to establishment of buffers with trees and grass. It can
   be speculated that increased diversity of functional enzymes associated
   with cycling of key soil nutrients and improved soil physical properties
   may reduce nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) from row-crop agriculture
   watersheds thus improving overall environmental quality. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Soil structure stability depends on several factors and its assessment
   is conducted using different methods and prediction indices. One of the
   indicators is soil organic matter (MOS) since it helps to keep mineral

   relationship between aggregate stability and MOS content, without
   considering its type or quality. Therefore, the present study assessed
   the association between quality and MOS content and topsoil structure
   stability in five Venezuelan agricultural soils. With simple random
   sampling nine observation points were selected in each soil, where
   samples were taken in order to determine: stable aggregate size
   distribution, particle size distribution, content and fractionation of
   MOS, and prediction indices of surface sealing and crusting derived from
   these characteristics. In order to determine the runoff percentage,
   simulated rainfall was used under field conditions. The soils showed low
   structure stability (except for El Salao soil) validated by the
   percentage of surface runoff obtained under field conditions. There was
   high association between the sizes (between 4 and 2 turn and < 0.25 mm)
   of water-stable aggregates and the different MOS fractions; fulvic acids
   fraction (CAF) had a negative relationship Kith aggregates of smaller

   established only with the FAO crusting index.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of organic carbon (OC) additions from farm manures and crop
   residues on selected soil bio-physical and physico-chemical properties
   were measured at seven experimental sites, on contrasting soil types,
   with a history of repeated applications of farm manure or differential
   rates of inorganic fertilizer nitrogen (N). Repeated (> 7 years annual
   additions) and relatively large OC inputs (up to 65 t OC ha(-1)) were
   needed to produce measurable changes in soil properties, particularly
   physical properties. However, over all the study sites, there was a
   positive relationship between OC inputs and changes in total soil OC and
   `light' fraction OC (LFOC), with LFOC providing a more sensitive
   indicator of changes in soil organic matter status. Total soil OC
   increased by an average of 3\% for every 10 t ha(-1) manure OC applied,
   whereas LFOC increased by c. 14\%. The measured soil OC increases were
   equivalent to c. 23\% of the manure OC applied (up to 65 t OC ha(-1)
   applied over 9 years) and c. 22\% of the crop residue OC applied (up to
   32 t OC ha(-1) over 23 years). The manure OC inputs (but not crop
   residue OC inputs) increased topsoil porosity and plant available water
   capacity, and decreased bulk density by 0.6\%, 2.5\% and 0.5\% with
   every 10 t ha(-1) manure OC applied, respectively. Both OC sources
   increased the size of the microbial biomass (11\% increase in biomass C
   with 10 t OC ha(-1) input), but only manure OC increased its activity
   (16\% increase in the soil respiration rate with 10 t OC ha(-1) input).
   Likewise, the potentially mineralizable N pool only increased with
   manure N inputs (14\% increase with 1 t manure total N ha(-1)). However,
   these soil quality benefits need to be balanced with any potential
   environmental impacts, such as excessive nutrient accumulation,
   increased nitrate leaching and phosphorus losses and gaseous emissions

Title = {{Using earthworm avoidance behaviour to assess the toxicity of formulated
   herbicides and their active ingredients on natural soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Soil quality has been threatened by intensive agricultural practises,
   namely those relying on the application of pesticides, such as
   herbicides. Among the non-target terrestrial organisms exposed to such
   scenarios, earthworms are key ecological receptors widely used in
   ecotoxicological studies. As such, this work aims to assess the effects
   of two herbicide active ingredients (a.i.)-sulcotrione and
   penoxsulam-and their respective commercial formulations-MIKADOA (R) and
   VIPERA (R) (referred as Mikado and Viper)-on the avoidance behaviour of
   Eisenia andrei. In an attempt to enhance the ecological relevance of the
   generated toxicity data, the avoidance tests were run with standard
   (LUFA 2.2; L) and natural soils (from corn and rice fields), as long as
   their habitat function did not constrain the earthworm behaviour.
   Earthworms were bred in the lab before test conductance. The natural
   soils used as substrates were collected before the cropping season on
   corn (C) and rice (R) fields, which are integrated in a wide area
   exploited for agriculture. Their physico-chemical characterization
   evolved the determination of pH (H(2)O, KCl), conductivity, organic
   matter (OM) and clay/silt contents, and water-holding capacity (WHC).
   The avoidance tests intended to ascertain (1) the random distribution of
   earthworms in the natural soils C and R (dual-control tests), (2) the
   habitat function of natural soils against each other and against L soil,
   (3) the effect of active ingredients and formulated herbicides on E.
   andrei behaviour. Avoidance tests with the a.i.s were only performed in
   L soil. Data evaluation followed ISO (2005) guidelines.
   C and R soils presented higher OM (5.1\% and 4.5\%, respectively) and
   clay/silt (53.3 and 43.1, respectively) contents and WHC (107.2 and
   109.9\%, respectively) than L soil (4.1, 21.4 and 48.0\%,
   correspondingly). Earthworms distributed randomly in dual-control tests,
   but preferred R soil significantly, relative to L or C soils. The LOEC
   and EC(50) values calculated for sulcotrione (> 1,000.0 and 1,263.3 mg
   a.i. kg(-1), respectively) and Mikado (1,012.8 and 1,301.3 mg a.i.
   kg(-1), respectively) were much higher than those calculated for
   penoxsulam (100 and 80.6 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) or Viper (52.7
   and 51.5 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively), when L soil was used as
   substrate. Moreover, the habitat function of L soil contaminated with
   the formulated herbicide Viper was more constrained relative to that of
   the a.i. penoxsulam. Viper induced higher \% avoidance on E. andrei
   exposed to the contaminated L soil compared to that under the R soil.
   The response of earthworms to R (attraction) and C (avoidance) soils
   could be related, not only to the quantity of OM content, but also to
   the quality of organic and inorganic fractions of soil, beyond other
   intrinsic properties of soils. Both Mikado and sulcotrione impacted the
   behaviour of E. andrei only slightly. This endpoint was more affected
   under penoxsulam or Viper exposures on L soil, being the
   latter-formulated product even more repellent for E. andrei than the
   a.i. The effect of adjuvants added to the commercial formulation of
   Viper, may have increased the toxicity of the a.i. Thereby, our results
   reinforce the need for a careful assessment of the impacts of formulated
   products. Furthermore, since there was a reduction in earthworm \%
   avoidance under Viper exposures on the natural soil R, it was possible
   that pesticide bioavailability had been reduced by its sorption to OM
   and clay mineral sorption sites.
   Though the standard L soil should be used for reproducibility and
   comparison means, other natural soils should be added to the assessment
   of chemicals, for sake of ecological relevance. Both herbicides induced
   avoidance behaviour on E. andrei, albeit stronger effects were denoted
   by penoxsulam and its respective formulated product, Viper. Overall,
   avoidance tests provided a sensitive, valuable and feasible response
   either to compare the habitat function of different standard and
   agricultural natural soils or to test the effect of herbicides.
   An effort should be made to enlarge the terrestrial ecotoxicological
   database as a way to fulfil the huge lack of information available for
   this ecosystem. In this context, additional research congregating a
   potential linkage between physiological activities sustaining the
   regular metabolism of earthworms and their avoidance behaviour or even
   their reproductive effects would be welcomed, especially in what regards
   formulated pesticides. Such approach would provide a robust and
   comprehensive understanding of chemical effects. Furthermore, it is
   encouraged that natural soils should be used to improve the reliability
   of chemical testing.}},

Abstract = {{Forest and pastureland soils in highland of northern Iran are being
   seriously degraded and destructed due to extensive agricultural
   activities. These land use changes are usually accompanied by decreasing
   in concentrations of soil organic carbon and nutrients and also
   deterioration of soil structure in these regions. However, studies on
   concentration of nutrients and carbohydrates in soils suggest that the
   location of nutrients within aggregates of each size should be
   determined. This study was to evaluate the nutrient elements and
   carbohydrate distributions within water-stable aggregates (WSA) of
   virgin forest and pasture lands under different land uses in Alborz
   maintain range, northern Iran. In September 2006, soil samples were
   collected from depths of 0-20 cm in Typic Haploxerolls soils. The
   overall pattern indicated that the mean weight diameter (MWD) and WSA
   were greater in the virgin pasture and forest soils compared with the
   adjacent cultivated (ex-forest and ex-pasture) soils and aggregates of
   >1.0 mm size were dominant in the virgin soils, whereas the cultivated
   soils comprised aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. Distribution of
   organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbohydrates within the WSA
   showed preferential enrichment of these parameters in the macroaggregate
   fraction (4.75-1.0 mm) for the virgin soils and microaggregate fraction
   (>0.25 mm) for the exposed soils. Cultivation decreased the
   concentration of carbohydrates by 23.6\% and 20.6\% in ex-forest and
   ex-pasture lands, respectively. Average distribution of total
   exchangeable bases within WSA showed that the cultivation of forest and
   pasture soils significantly led to reduce in these nutrient in the
   4.75-2.0 mm fraction and increase in concentration of these exchangeable
   cations in <0.25 mm fractions. In general, results indicated that
   cultivation significantly led to 71 \% and 6\% reductions in total
   exchangeable bases within the 4.75-2.0 and <0.25 mm aggregate fraction,
   respectively, for virgin soil. Since smaller aggregates are
   preferentially removed by erosion, this study emphasizes the need for
   sustainable soil management practices that they will minimize nutrient
   loss when forest or pastures lands are converted to croplands. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Lowland soils are commonly found in the state of Rio Grande do Sul,
   Southern of Brazil, where they represent around 20\% of the total area.
   Deficient drainage is the most important natural characteristic of these
   soils which therefore are mainly in use for irrigated rice (Oriza
   sativa). Degradation in these soils is progressively getting stronger
   since the intensity of agricultural activities leads to a higher soil
   density, and a lower water infiltration rate. There is a growing
   interest by farmers to grow other crops such as soybean in rotation with
   (flood) irrigated rice but this degradation has become an obstacle to do
   so. This study was done with the objective to assess the soil physical
   and chemical quality of the three rice management systems (conventional,
   semi-direct and pre-germinated) most used in the region of Camaqua
   municipality, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Samples were collected
   from 21 rice farms with 2 different types of lowland soil (Albaqualf and
   Humaquepts). The soil samples were analysed for physical and chemical
   properties. Using multivariate analysis of covariance (Mancova), the
   effects of the natural variability in terms of soil clay content were
   separated from the management effects. The analysis revealed that soil
   physical and chemical properties were affected by the management
   practices adopted by farmers. The results showed that the major effect
   of the management systems was on a physical property: bulk density. An
   increase in soil density in the pre-germinated and conventional systems
   was found to be caused by a significant reduction in the volume occupied
   by micropores, an indication of structural degradation. The semi-direct
   management system, associated with less intensive tillage operations
   retained better soil conditions and a better organic matter status. The
   chemical properties significantly affected by management (total N. Ca,
   Mg, Fe, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and potential acidity {[}PA])
   all had their highest values in the semi-direct management system. This
   study confirmed that the physical soil degradation forms the main
   obstacle for growing other crops in a rotation with rice. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Soil restoration is the process by which a soil that has been disturbed
   by excavation and displacement or by degradation is returned to its
   original state by means of active treatment. At the beginning of the
   process, restored soils are mechanically labile and susceptible to
   compaction. In this study, we monitored the regeneration of some
   physical soil quality indicators (bulk density, coarse porosity,
   penetration resistance) and the development of indicators of mechanical
   stability (precompression stress, compression index) of a refilled sandy
   loam originating from an Eutric Cambisol. In particular, we derived
   multiple linear regression equations to correlate precompression stress
   and compression index to soil texture, gravel content, organic carbon
   content and void ratio.
   During the 3-year observation period after restoration, bulk density and
   penetration resistance increased significantly, while coarse porosity
   decreased significantly. Nonetheless, these parameters remained in a
   range, which is considered to indicate suitable physical soil conditions
   for root growth over the entire period of observation. Precompression
   stress increased significantly in the topsoil as well as in the subsoil.
   The compression index was significantly higher in the topsoil than the
   subsoil and stayed fairly constant over the observation period.
   Precompression stress was negatively and the compression index was
   positively correlated with initial void ratio and to coarse porosity.
   Taking additional parameters into account, such as gravel content, clay
   content, silt content and organic matter content, improved the
   correlation with precompression stress. The equations derived with
   multiple linear regression analysis from our data set gave a
   satisfactory coefficient of determination for the compression index
   (r(2) = 0.81), but rather poor estimates for precompression stress (r(2)

Abstract = {{A large industrial area on the dry land facing the Venice lagoon, in
   North East Italy, is currently being reclaimed. This paper focuses on
   the modifications of the structural characteristics occurring on the
   surface and along the profile of some industrial waste in an area that
   has been colonized by woody plants.
   Qualitative micromorphological observations of thin sections of
   undisturbed soil samples showed that all samples taken from the surface
   layer (0-5 cm) of the woody area looked similar to samples from natural
   forest soil abundant in organic matter and with an open and crumby
   structure rich in pores. In some samples the substrate alteration was
   still evident at a depth of 20-25 cm. Quantitative data on the soil pore
   system obtained by image analysis were consistent with previous findings
   and total porosity decreased along the profile from about 30\% to less
   than 5\%. Elongated pores were the most abundant in the majority of
   samples, and the intermediate size class (0.2-1.0 mm) was the most
   representative. Good structural properties were also confirmed by the
   cracking patterns of artificially dried surface soil samples, which
   showed a network of fine cracks.
   Comparisons are also given with an adjacent area where phytoextraction
   trials were carried out according to common agricultural practices. (C)

Abstract = {{The relationship between seasonal agricultural drought and detrended
   yields (within a period from 1961 to 2000) of selected crops was
   assessed in the conditions of the Czech Republic, which are to some
   extent representative of a wider area of Central Europe. Impact of water
   stress was analyzed using time series of yields for 8 crops (spring
   barley, winter wheat, grain maize, potato, winter rape, oats, winter rye
   and hay from permanent meadows) for 77 districts in the Czech Republic
   (average district area is 1025 km(2)). Relative version of Palmer's
   Z-index (rZ-index or rZ-i) was used as a tool for quantification of
   agricultural drought. The monthly values of the rZ-index for each
   individual district were calculated as the spatial average (only for the
   grids of arable land). The study showed that severe droughts (e.g., in
   1981 and 2000) are linked with significant reduction in yields of the
   main cereals and majority of other crops through the most drought prone
   regions. We found a statistically significant correlation (p <= 0.05)
   between the sum of the rZ-index for the main growing period of each crop
   and the yield departures of spring barley within 81\% (winter wheat in
   57\%, maize in 48\%, potato in 89\%, oats in 79\%, winter rye in 52\%,
   rape in 39\%, hay in 79\%) of the analyzed districts. This study also
   defined the crop-specific thresholds under which a soil moisture deficit
   (expressed in terms of rZ-index) leads to severe impact at the district
   level. This can be expressed as the sum of the monthly rZ-index during
   the period of high crop sensitivity to drought; for spring barley it is
   -5, winter wheat -5, maize -9, rape -12, winter rye -10, oat -4, potato
   -6 and for hay -3. The length of the sensitive period is also
   crop-specific and includes the months that are important for the yield
   formation. The results show that yields of spring barley (and spring
   crops in general) are significantly more affected by seasonal water
   stress than yields of winter crops and hay from permanent meadows. The
   study proved that a severe drought spell during the sensitive period of
   vegetative season does have a quantifiable negative effect, even within
   more humid regions. These results demonstrate that, at least in some
   areas of the CR (and probably most of Central Europe), drought is one of
   the key causes of interannual yield variability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Erosion is the main cause of soil degradation, and it leads to adverse
   effects to agriculture and environment, with social and economic
   implications. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil and
   nutrient losses in different soil tillage systems in a typic Acric
   Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). On five plots with the following soil
   tillage treatments were evaluated: conventional tillage and down-slope
   tillage (CMA); conventional tillage and contour seeding (CEN); tillage
   with one passage of heavy disk harrow and one passage of leveling harrow
   and contour seeding (CNiv); tillage with two passages of leveling harrow
   and contour seeding (NA) and no tillage and contour seeding (CMN). The
   soil losses were determined by the direct method during the cotton crop
   cycle, from December 2005 to June 2006. Along each runoff sampling, soil
   samples were withdrawn to quantify the losses of N, P, K and organic
   carbon (C-org) in the sediments. Decreasing soil tillage lessened the
   losses of sediments, nutrients and organic carbon, indicating that the
   CMN treatment was the most efficient. The trends for N, P, K and C-org
   losses in the sediments were similar to the soil losses. N, P and K
   varied according to the fertilizers used. The constituent with the
   highest concentration in the sediment was C in organic compounds. The
   basic infiltration rate differed among the treatments in the following
   order: CMA < CEN congruent to CNiv congruent to NA < CMN, indicating
   that tillage systems that reduced soil revolving and increased organic
   C, increased the basic infiltration rate and decreased soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Global energy demand of 424 EJ year(-1) in 2000 is increasing at the
   rate of 2.2\% year(-1). There is a strong need to increase biofuel
   production because of the rising energy costs and the risks of global
   warming caused by fossil fuel combustion. Biofuels, being C-neutral and
   renewable energy sources, are an important alternative to fossil fuels.
   Therefore, identification of viable sources of biofuel feedstock is a
   high priority. Harvesting lignocellulosic crop residues, especially of
   cereal crops, is being considered by industry as one of the sources of
   biofuel feedstocks. Annual production of lignocellulosic residues of
   cereals is estimated at 367 million Mg year(-1) (75\% of the total) for
   the U.S., and 2800 million Mg year(-1) (74.6\% of the total) for the
   world. The energy value of the residue is 16 x 10(6), BTU Mg(-1).
   However, harvesting crop residues would have strong adverse impact on
   soil quality. Returning crop residues to soil as amendments is essential
   to: (a) recycling plant nutrients (20-60 kg of N, P, K, Ca per Mg of
   crop residues) amounting to 118 million Mg of N, P, K in residues
   produced annually in the world (83.5\% of world's fertilizer
   consumption), (b) sequestering soil C at the rate of 100-1000 kg C
   ha(-1) year(-1) depending on soil type and climate with a total
   potential of 0.6-1.2 Pg C year(-1) in world soils, (c) improving soil
   structure, water retention and transmission properties, (d) enhancing
   activity and species diversity of soil fauna, (e) improving water
   infiltration rate, (f) controlling water runoff and minimizing risks of
   erosion by water and wind, (g) conserving water in the root zone, and
   (h) sustaining agronomic productivity by decreasing losses and
   increasing use efficiency of inputs. Thus, harvesting crop residues as
   biofuel feedstock would jeopardize soil and water resources which are
   already under great stress. Biofuel feedstock must be produced through
   biofuel plantations established on specifically identified soils which
   do not compete with those dedicated to food crop production. Biofuel
   plantations, comprising of warm season grasses (e.g., switch grass),
   short rotation woody perennials (e.g., poplar) and herbaceous species
   (e.g., miscanthus) must be established on agriculturally
   surplus/marginal soils or degraded/desertified soils. Plantations
   established on such soils would restore degraded ecosystems, enhance
   soil/terrestrial C pool, improve water resources and produce biofuel
   feedstocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic residues such as sewage sludge, biowastes and composts are
   increasingly used in land rehabilitation because they can improve the
   physical, chemical and biochemical properties of soil, and reduce the
   need for inorganic fertilization. Furthermore, their use contributes to
   an integrated approach to waste management by promoting recycling of
   nutrients and minimizing final disposal, especially of organic residues
   that, due to their composition, can pose problems to agricultural soils.
   In the present study, three different types of organic residues were
   considered as amendments to be used in the reclamation of a
   metal-contaminated mine soil from the Aljustrel mining area (a pyrite
   mine located in the SW Portugal in the Iberian Pyrite Belt), with high
   Cu, Pb and Zn total contents: sewage sludge from a municipal wastewater
   treatment plant (SS), compost from the organic fraction of unsorted
   municipal solid waste (MSWC), and garden waste compost (GWC), applied at
   100 and 200 Mg ha(-1). The soil and mixtures of soil and amendments were
   adjusted to 70\% of the maximum water-holding capacity determined for
   each type of sample and incubated in a controlled-temperature room at 20
   +/- 1 degrees C. Sub-samples were taken prior to wetting (time zero),
   and after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of incubation, and analysed for pH,
   electrical conductivity, organic matter content, effectively
   bioavailable Cu, Zn and Pb (extracted with 0.01 mol L-1 calcium
   chloride) and potentially bioavailable metals (extracted with 0.5 mol
   L-1 ammonium acetate, 0.5 mol L-1 acetic acid and 0.01 mol L-1 EDTA, pH
   4.7). In general, organic residues corrected soil acidity, and increased
   the total organic matter content of the soil. The SS and the MSWC
   amendments were roughly equivalent in their ability to correct soil
   acidity whereas the GWC had the smallest liming capacity and only with
   200 Mg ha(-1) GWC did the soil pH reach acceptable values. As expected,
   all the tested organic residues, at both application rates, were
   effective in reducing the effectively bioavailable metals in the soil.
   The Zn bioavailability was the most affected by the addition of organic
   residues, whereas Pb bioavailability was small even in the unamended
   soil and was the least affected by treatments. Potentially bioavailable
   metals increased with SS and MSWC application and the opposite was true
   following amendment with GWC.}},

Abstract = {{Soils provide the largest terrestrial carbon store, the largest

   largest terrestrial CH4 sink, as mediated through root and soil
   microbial processes. A change in land use or management can alter these
   soil processes such that net greenhouse gas exchange may increase or
   decrease. We measured soil-atmosphere exchange of CO2, N2O and CH4 in
   four adjacent land-use systems (native eucalypt woodland, clover-grass
   pasture, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus plantation) for short,
   but continuous, periods between October 2005 and June 2006 using an
   automated trace gas measurement system near Albany in southwest Western
   Australia. Mean N2O emission in the pasture was 26.6 mu g N m(-2) h(-1),
   significantly greater than in the natural and managed forests (< 2.0 mu
   g N m(-2) h(-1)). N2O emission from pasture soil increased after
   rainfall events (up to 100 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and as soil water content
   increased into winter, whereas no soil water response was detected in
   the forest systems. Gross nitrification through N-15 isotope dilution in
   all land-use systems was small at water holding capacity < 30\%, and
   under optimum soil water conditions gross nitrification ranged between <
   0.1 and 1.0 mg N kg(-1) h(-1), being least in the native
   woodland/eucalypt plantation < pine plantation < pasture. Forest soils
   were a constant CH4 sink, up to -20 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) in the native
   woodland. Pasture soil was an occasional CH4 source, but weak CH4 sink
   overall (-3 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)). There were no strong correlations (R <
   0.4) between CH4 flux and soil moisture or temperature. Soil CO2
   emissions (35-55 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) correlated with soil water content (R
   < 0.5) in all but the E. globulus plantation. Soil N2O emissions from
   improved pastures can be considerable and comparable with intensively
   managed, irrigated and fertilised dairy pastures. In all land uses, soil
   N2O emissions exceeded soil CH4 uptake on a carbon dioxide equivalent
   basis. Overall, afforestation of improved pastures (i) decreases soil
   N2O emissions and (ii) increases soil CH4 uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation and the accompanying decline in crop yields are the
   main limiting factors for the further development of agriculture on the
   Chinese Loess Plateau. A 10-year experiment was conducted in Linfen on
   the Loess Plateau to assess the potential benefits of controlled traffic
   oil agricultural production. In this region, long-term traditional
   ploughing with straw removal has resulted in a decline of soil
   productivity and poor soil structure. Several treatments were compared:
   controlled traffic with no-tillage and straw cover (NTSC), controlled
   traffic with shallow tillage and straw cover, and traditional tillage
   (TT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Results show
   clear benefits of controlled traffic farming. Winter wheat growth in
   ploughed Plots Was Much slower than in controlled traffic plots. Mean
   yield from 1998 to 2007 was 11.2\% lower for traditional tillage than
   for controlled traffic plots. The best results were achieved by a
   no-tillage straw cover and controlled traffic system (NTSC), which
   resulted in the greatest benefits to soil Structure after 10 years. The
   NTSC significantly improved soil organic matter content in the top 30
   cut by 27.2\%, total N by 10.8\%, and available P (top 10 cm) by 92.3\%
   compared with TT. Aeration (>60 mu m) and capillary porosity (2-60 mu m)
   were 155.0\%, and 16.1\% greater, respectively, in NTSC plots than in TT
   plots. Consequently, for NTSC, final water infiltration rates were
   67.4\% greater than for TT, whereas water content in the top 130 cm was
   14.9\% higher than in TT, respectively. We conclude therefore that
   controlled traffic combined with no-tillage and straw cover is a
   valuable system for restoring soil productivity and quality of seriously
   degraded soils on the Loess Plateau for the sustainable development of
   agriculture in dryland China.}},

   moist (40\% water holding capacity) sandy soil and incubated at 20
   degrees C for 28 days. Each residue under-went a different
   mineralization pattern depending on the nature and complexity of its
   chemical constituents. In all cases, the addition of the waste produced,
   after a short lag-phase, an exponential increase in the soil respiration
   rate, reflecting the growth of microbial biomass. The amount of total
   extra CO(2)-C evolved after 28 days, expressed as \% in respect to added
   C, differed significantly (P < 0.005) among application doses: 5 > 10 >
   20 mg g(-1) and residue type: meat bone meal > blood meal > cotton
   cardings > wheat straw. Plant residues led to a rapid immobilisation of
   N that affected microbial size and activity and further mineralization.
   Animal by-products produced an immediate and remarkable increase of
   mineral N in the soil. However, the large amounts of NH(4)(+) released
   in the soil at high rates of animal residues led, in some cases, to
   temporary adverse effects on microbial biomass growth and nitrification.
   All residues produced a significant increase in soil microbial biomass
   size and activity, being the intensity of the response related to their
   chemical properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon sequestration is a viable short-term option to mitigate
   increased atmospheric CO2. In agriculture, strategies to increase the
   soil carbon (C) sink include no-tillage, cover crops, and improved crop
   rotation. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of
   tillage systems on SOC and total N, soil aggregation and aggregate
   associated C and N in three soil types: Oxisol (Brazil), Vertisol
   (Argentina), and Mollisol (USA). Long-term tillage experiments included
   tilled (T) and no-till (NT) systems. A native grassland was included for
   comparison in each site. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 0-15, and 15-30
   cm depths. Water-stable aggregates (WSA) were separated using a
   wet-sieving method. Total C and total N were determined by dry
   combustion. A shift from native grassland to an agroecosystem decreased
   microbial biomass, but this decrease was less pronounced under NT.
   Cultivation reduced the mass of macroaggregates and the concentration
   associated C and N; however among agroecosystems, NT, regardless soil
   type, tended to be more similar to the native grassland sites.
   Agroecosystems reduced TOC and total N stocks, regardless of soil type,
   compared to the native grassland. This effect followed: Mollisol >
   Oxisol > Vertisol, and was more pronounced at the 0-5 cm soil depth than
   at deeper depths. This loss of C and N was associated with the decrease
   in the mass of macroaggregates and lower C and N concentrations of the
   aggregates. Macroaggregation was related to TOC and microbial biomass in
   the Mollisol, suggesting that the biological process of aggregate
   formation is the principal mechanism of C protection in these soils. The
   relationship between TOC and large macroaggregates showed lower values
   for the Oxisol and Vertisol, indicating that in these soils TOC has a
   complementary role in macroaggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Most published studies related to crop effects on denitrification are
   not continuous and are based on the growing period. The objective of
   this work was to evaluate the effect of different amounts of soybean
   stubble, under different soil moisture contents, on gaseous nitrogen (N)
   losses by denitrification from an agricultural soil. The following soil
   moisture treatments were reached by adding distilled water to soil cores
   of a typic Hapludoll: 50 and 100\% of water-filled porosity space
   (WFPS). Residue treatments included no application of residues,
   amendment with 2600kgha-1 of soybean residues, and amendment with
   5200kgha-1 of soybean residues. Cumulative nitrous oxide + dinitrogen
   (N2O + N2) emissions displayed great variability, ranging between 0 and
   581.91 mu g N kg-1, which represented 0 to 3.93\% of the N residue
   applied. Under 50\% WFPS moisture conditions, statistical differences in
   cumulative N2O + N2 emissions between residue treatments were not
   detected (p = 0.21), whereas at saturation conditions, cumulative N2O +
   N2 emissions decreased with the application of increasing amounts of
   soybean residues (p = 0.017). Daily and cumulative N2O + N2 emissions
   significantly increased as soil moisture increased, except at soils
   amended with 5200kgha-1 of soybean residues; this lack of statistical
   difference was probably due to the immobilization of native mineral N.
   Under 50\% WFPS soil moisture contents, aeration seemed to be the main
   factor controlling redox conditions, limiting the denitrification
   process, and preventing differences in N emissions between residue
   treatments. The application of soybean residues to saturated soils
   notably decreased N2O + N2 emissions by denitrification through a strong
   mineral N immobilization into organic and nondenitrifiable forms.}},

   heavy metals in cultivated soil horizon and in edible parts of open
   field grown vegetables increased over time and were significantly higher
   than those recorded in OFG plots. Increased contents of heavy metals in

   concentrations of heavy metal appeared in the order Zn > Pb > Cu > Ni >
   Cd and were maximum in leaves (spinach and amaranths) followed by fruits
   (tomato and egg plant) and minimum in roots (carrot and radish).
   Multiple regression analysis indicated that the major contribution of
   most heavy metals to vegetable leaves was from atmosphere. For roots

   lead to a destabilizing effect on this sustainable agricultural practice

Abstract = {{Monocropping of lowland rice is the predominant system in valley land
   and high-rainfall regions of northeastern India. Recently, the
   unsustainability of this system has owing to soil structural
   deterioration and nutrient depletion, become evident, resulting from
   continuous puddling on the same piece of land even if recommended
   inorganic fertilizers have been applying regularly. To regenerate and
   maintain soil structure in rice fields, farmers in this region
   frequently use farm yard manure (FYM), but low availability of FYM
   because of its other uses indicates that it could not meet the organic
   matter requirements of this system. We evaluated the long-term effects
   of different locally available jungle grasses and weeds on soil
   hydro-physical properties and rice yield through a 5-year field
   experiment (2000 to 2005) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research
   (ICAR) Complex for North Eastern Hilly (NEH) Region, Umiam, Meghalaya,
   India and also compared their negative or positive effects with FYM in
   acidic, Typic Hapludalf soil. The objective was to determine whether
   locally available grasses (Jungle grass) and weeds (Ambrosia sp.) could
   be used as alternative sources of organic materials for lowland rice in
   scarcity of FYM. Results showed that incorporation of FYM or jungle
   grass or Ambrosia sp., continuously for 5 years in puddled rice soil
   improved soil organic carbon (SOC) by 21.1\%; the stability of
   micro-aggregates, moisture retention capacity, and infiltration rate of
   the soil by 82.5, 10, and 31.3\%, respectively; and soil bulk density
   decreased by 12.6\%. Application of FYM produced better soil physical
   environment than that under jungle grass and Ambrosia sp. However, as
   these grasses and weeds contained higher nutrient levels than FYM and
   increased the SOC slowly, these organics may serve as alternative to FYM
   and may have a dramatic effect on long-term productivity of rice. The
   gradual improvement in soil physical properties led to a significantly
   higher yield of rice. We conclude that applying organic manure or
   organic residue annually may mitigate the negative effect of puddling
   and related properties and therefore could contribute to the
   sustainability of the wetland rice ecosystem.}},

   NH4+, NO2- and NO3- were monitored in a laboratory experiment. The crop
   and tied ridges had no effect on soil characteristics and dynamics of C

   beds with retention of all crop residues. The WHC, organic C, soil
   microbial biomass and total N were >= 1.1 larger in soil from nontilled
   beds where the crop residue was retained compared to where it was
   removed after only 6 years. The emission of CO2 was 1.2 times and

   was 1.2 times and the emission of N2O after 1 day 2.3 times larger in
   soil under tilled beds compared to nontilled beds with full residue

   increase the soil bulk density and reduce total prosity, microporosity,
   water retention and availability, compared with native systems such as
   garss field and forest. The conventional system redcues organic carbon
   content and aggregate stability, whereas no-tillage, after five years,

   objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of vertical
   mulching as a conservation practice to restrict runoff in areas under
   no-tillage system, by evaluating the sediment enrichment rate based on
   double soil sampling in fields with presence and absence ofthe practice
   of vertical mulching. The double sampling covered representative soils
   of each plantation and the respective sediments generated by hydric
   erosion. Soil pH in water, SMP index, available P, exchangeable K, Ca,
   Mg and Al, and organic matter were determined, and the total and base
   saturation and cation exchange capacity in each sample were calculated.
   Results indicate that the conservation practice of vertical mulching
   reduces the degree of chemical enrichment ofthe sediments and mainly
   prevents the transport of these sediments away from plantations,
   minimizing economical losses and environmental risks. The no tillage
   system, without complementary conservation practices to control runoff,
   does therefore not represent a soil conservation practice capable of
   preventing environmental degradation.}},

Abstract = {{We examined relationships between the pore structure of microaggregates
   and the protection of organic matter (OM) within that structure. By
   using ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) before and after
   combustion of microaggregates at 350 degrees C, we took advantage of
   differences in X-ray scattering contrast among soil minerals, OM, and
   air to evaluate the distribution of the total- and OM-filled porosity
   within microaggregates (53-250 mu m in diameter). Systematic changes in
   microaggregate structure were observed for long-term field manipulations
   of land use (a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations) and
   agricultural management (conventional tillage versus no-till at two
   levels of nitrogen fertilization). Our results imply that OM
   preservation arose from the evolution of the architectural system of
   microaggregates during their formation and stabilization. Soils and
   treatments with increasing OM in microaggregates were associated with
   encapsulation of colloidal OM by minerals, thereby creating protected
   OM-filled pores at the submicron scale within the microaggregate
   structure. For example, in the prairie chronosequence, microaggregates
   from the cultivated soil had the lowest concentration of OM, but 75\% of
   the OM that had survived cultivation was in OM-filled pores. Following
   restoration, the concentration of OM in microaggregates increased
   rapidly, but the proportion of OM in OM-filled pores declined initially
   and then increased over time until 90\% of the OM was in OM-filled
   pores. OM totally encapsulated within the pore structure can create
   spatial and kinetic constraints on microbial access to and degradation
   of OM. Encapsulation of OM increases the capacity for its protection
   relative to sorption on mineral surfaces, and comparison of its extent
   among treatments suggests important feedback loops. The use of USAXS,
   which has not previously been applied to the study of soil aggregate
   structures and the distribution of OM within those structures, provided
   new information on the mechanisms of OM protection in soil
   microaggregates, and insights relevant to strategies for enhancing
   carbon-sequestration in soil through changes in agricultural management
   practices and land use. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Caragana microphylla Lam., a leguminous shrub, is a dominant native

   40-50 cm were collected from the C. microphylla plantations with an age
   sequence of 0, 5, 10, and 23 years. The results showed that shrub growth
   altered microclimate, increased litter input, and hence, improved soil
   water holding capacity, contents of total carbon, total N and microbial
   biomass C and N, electrical conductivity, and activities of urease,
   phosphomonoesterase, protease, dehydrogenase and polyphenol oxidase, and
   decreased soil bulk density. These trends increased with increasing
   plantation age but decreased with increasing soil depth. C. microphylla

Abstract = {{Degraded soil quality, which decreases agricultural productivity and
   increases nonpoint source pollution of surface water, may be ameliorated
   by employing soil organic matter enhancing management, such as practiced
   by compost use in organic farming. The value of compost applied at rates
   lower than those required to supply crop nutrient needs requires
   investigation because applying compost at agronomic nitrogen rates may
   not be economically feasible for organic vegetable producers. We
   conducted field research during 2000-2002 on a Luvisol to compare the
   nutrient and non-nutrient effects of various rates and timings of mixed
   poultry litter-yard waste compost with a traditional organic fertilizer
   (poultry litter) and inorganic fertilizer on environmental soil
   attributes and water quality in an organic vegetable crop rotation. Soil
   organic C, total N, and available P increased 60\%,68\%, and 225\%,
   respectively, above the control with the application of 144 Mg ha(-1)
   compost (dry wt.) during the 3-year study, but the low rate of compost
   (31 Mg ha(-1)) did not affect soil C or N. Compost IN mineralization was
   not synchronous with sweet corn N assimilation, resulting in excess root
   zone nitrate that would have posed a leaching risk without the use of a
   winter rye N-scavenging cover crop. The concentrations of nitrate N that
   leached below the tillage zone occasionally exceeded the 10 mg L(-1)
   health standard but were not different among the agronomic rates of
   compost, poultry litter, fertilizer, and control treatments for nearly
   every sampling event. Despite increasing runoff water concentrations of
   N and P, the high compost rate reduced the amounts of N and P that were
   transported from the soil surface by five-fold and four-fold,
   respectively, compared to the inorganic fertilizer due to a four-fold
   reduction in runoff volume. Crop yields did not benefit from low compost
   rates during the 3-year duration of the study; however, improvements in
   some bulk density and porosity indicated that benefits of longer term,
   low compost rate additions may accrue over time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Compaction is a major cause of soil degradation. It affects not only the
   porosity of the soil, but also the soil's hydrostructural stability.
   Soil that is restored after temporary removal is particularly sensitive
   to compaction. We investigated the effects of trafficking with a heavy
   combine harvester on the shrinkage behaviour of a restored soil that had
   been gently cultivated for several years. We tested the hypothesis that
   compaction decreases the hydrostructural stability of restored soil by
   analysing simultaneously measured shrinkage and water retention curves
   of undisturbed soil samples. Shrinkage strongly depended on clay and
   organic carbon content. Taking account of this influence and normalizing
   the shrinkage parameters with respect to these soil properties, we found
   pronounced effects of trafficking on shrinkage. Ten passes with the
   combine harvester decreased the structural porosity by about 40\% at
   maximum swelling and by about 30\% at the shrinkage limit and increased
   the bulk density by 8\% at maximum swelling and by 10\% at the shrinkage
   limit, but did not significantly affect the porosity of the soil plasma.
   Moreover, trafficking modified shrinkage, increasing the slopes of the
   shrinkage curve in the basic and structural shrinkage domains by about
   30\% and more than 150\% after 10 passes, respectively. Evidently the
   aggregate structure was strongly destabilized. The results indicate that
   the hydrostructural stability of the soil was still very sensitive to
   compaction by trafficking even 5 years after restoration. The analysis
   of shrinkage seemed well suited for the assessment of compaction effects
   on soil structure.}},

Abstract = {{Soil wettability affects physical properties such as aggregate
   stability, infiltration rate, or erodibility. To describe the wetting
   properties of soil, the soil-air-water contact angle (CA) is often used.
   At present, a direct measurement of the CA determined on intact soil
   aggregates and a direct comparison with corresponding homogenized
   aggregates is still lacking, mainly because standard methods have not
   been defined to measure the wettability of soil aggregates. In this
   study, the Capillary Rise Method (CRM) was used to assess contact angles
   of single intact 1-2 mm soil aggregates, packings of intact aggregates
   and packings of crushed (homogenized) aggregates of 9 topsoils and 3
   humus subsoils from 5 sites in Germany. In general, CAs of the
   homogenized aggregates were quite similar for all soils (65 degrees +/-
   10 degrees), while CAs for aggregate packings and single aggregates
   generally were larger for grassland and forest soils (60 degrees to 80
   degrees) than for arable soils (0 degrees to 20 degrees). It was
   concluded that all soils contain potentially hydrophobic pore surfaces,
   but the effectiveness of these surfaces to create water repellency
   depends on the small-scale architecture of the pore space and the
   distribution/position of hydrophobic components inside the matrix. These
   findings suggest that it is misleading. particularly for agricultural
   soils, to quantify wetting properties by only analyzing homogenized
   soil. We propose that CRM-CA measurements should be extended to
   investigations of intact aggregates and the wetting coefficient k=cos
   theta should also be displayed to distinguish more clearly between
   completely wettable soils and soils with low subcritical repellency.
   Finally, it should be noted that the methods proposed are only
   applicable to non-hydrophobic soil exhibiting subcritical water
   repellency (CA > 0 degrees,..., CA <= 90 degrees). (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Rising concerns about greenhouse gases, increased fuel prices, and the

   in the use of maize stover for bioenergy production. However, residue
   harvest must be weighed against potential negative impacts on soil

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of different soil tillage and fertilization on
   chemical parameters, soil structure stability and carbon distribution in
   water-stable macro-aggregates (WSA(ma)) of loamy Orthic Luvisol. In
   1994, the Department of Plant Production of the Slovak Agricultural
   University in Nitra established a long-term field experiment in locality
   Dolna Malanta. In 1994-2007, the soil samples were collected from the
   depth 0-0.3 m. The field experiment included two types of soil tillage
   (conventional tillage-CT and reduced tillage-RT) and three variants of
   fertilization (1. C-o-without fertilization, 2. PR + NPK-crop residues
   together with added NPK fertilizers, 3. NPK-with added NPK fertilizers).
   Different tillage and fertilization had statistically significant
   influence on changes of the soil pH and soil sorptive complex. The
   values of pH were more favourable in RT than in CT. In NPK (by 26\%) and
   in PR + NPK (by 21\%) decreased values of hydrolytic acidity. On the
   other hand it increased the sum of basic cations. This led to the
   increase of cation exchangeable capacity. In comparison to CT, a higher
   total carbon concentration (Q) was determined in RT. According to
   vulnerability coefficient (K-v), the soil structure stability was better
   in RT (4.64 +/- 1.54) than in CT (5.15 +/- 1.75). Average value of
   WSA(ma) was higher by 9\% in RT and it led to increasing of the sum of
   mean weight diameters of water-stable aggregates (MWD-WSA) by 11\% and
   increasing of index stability (S-w) by 12\%. We determined linear
   dependences between C-t and critic level of soil organic matter
   concentration (S-t) in CT and RT as well as in PR + NPK and NPK. The
   negative correlation between Ca2+ and S-t (-0.507(..)) and positive
   correlation between Ca2+ and crusting index (0.525(..)) were detected in
   CT. The values of Ca2+ were in positive correlation with crusting index
   (0.363(.)) in RT. We observed higher concentrations of C-t and labile
   carbon content (C-L) in water-stable micro-aggregates (WSA(mi)) and
   WSA(ma) in the size fractions from 25 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-3) m in RT.
   There were also higher concentrations of C-t and C-L in WSA(ma) in the
   size fractions >3 X 10(-3) m in CT. The application of crop residues
   together with NPK fertilizers increased the concentration of C-t in all
   fractions of WSA(ma). On the other hand, C-t concentration decreased by
   7\% in WSA(mi). In PR + NPK, the highest concentration of C-L was
   observed in WSA(ma) in the size fraction 2 x 10(-3) to 3 x 10(-3) m. (C)

Abstract = {{Grazing of cover crops in grain cropping systems can increase economic
   return and diversify agricultural production systems, but the
   environmental consequences of this intensified management have not been
   well documented, especially under different tillage systems. We
   conducted a multiple-year investigation of how cover crop management
   (grazed and ungrazed) and tillage system {[}conventional (CT; initial
   moldboard plowing and thereafter disk tillage) and no tillage (NIT)]
   affected soil physical properties (bulk density, aggregation,
   infiltration, and penetration resistance) on a Typic Kanhapludult in
   Georgia. Responses were determined in two cropping systems: summer
   grain/winter cover crop and winter grain/ summer cover crop. Soil bulk
   density was reduced (P = 0.02) with CT compared with NT to a depth of 30
   cm at the end of 0.5 year, but only to a depth of 12 cm at the end of 2,
   2.5. and 4.5 years. Grazing of cover crops had little effect on soil
   bulk density, except eventually with 4.5 years of management.
   Water-stable macroaggregation was reduced (P <= 0.01) with CT compared
   with NT to a depth of 12 cm at all sampling times during the first 2.5
   years of evaluation. Stability of macroaggregates in water was
   unaffected by grazing of cover crops in both tillage systems. Across 7
   sampling events during the first 4 years, there was a tendency (P =
   0.07) for water infiltration rate to be lower with grazing of cover
   crops (5.6 mm rnin(-1)) than when ungrazed (6.9 mm min(-1)),
   irrespective of tillage system. Across 10 sampling events, soil
   penetration resistance was greater under NT than under CT at a depth of

Abstract = {{Land-use change affects vast areas of the semiarid region of central
   Argentina, where agriculture becomes predominant over mixed farming
   systems, and large areas of permanent pastures (PAS) are being converted
   to agricultural land. This land-use change causes loss of soil
   structure, but very little is known about the effect of changes in
   aggregate size distribution on soil physical, chemical and biological
   properties. We decided to use dry sieved aggregates since this technique
   is commonly used in semiarid regions. The study was carried out at
   Anguil, La Pampa, Argentina. The soil was a sandy loam Entic Haplustoll
   with a carbonate-free A-horizon. The PAS site had been under weeping
   love grass for more than 40 years. Parts of this PAS were turned to
   cultivation in 1989 (CULT14) and in 2001 (CULT2). Sampling was carried
   out at 0.6 m intervals to 0.18 m depth. Bulk density (BD), organic
   carbon (OC), and water holding capacity and infiltration were determined
   on these samples. Dry aggregate size distribution and OC content of the
   size fractions were determined on large undisturbed samples. Samples of
   pooled aggregate size fractions > 4, 1-4, and < 1 mm, as well as
   corresponding samples of non fractionated soil were incubated and
   respiration was measured by CO2 evolved. The soil of CULT2 had 29\%
   lower contents of large (> 4 mm) and 37\% higher contents of very small
   (< 1 mm) aggregates than PAS. The intermediate size aggregates were not
   affected by the short-term effect of tillage. OC loss in CULT2 was 16\%
   regarding PAS. Longer term effects of cultivation were characterized by
   30\% loss of intermediate size aggregates, 22\% increase of bulk
   density, 74 and 19\% decrease in water infiltration and water retention,
   respectively of CULT14 compared to PAS. A 32\% decrease of OC was
   observed after 14 years of cultivation. Intermediate size aggregates had
   highest OC contents and no difference between treatments was found,
   except for a lower value of large aggregates in CULT14. Respiration
   rates and total CO2 evolved was related to OC contents of fractions;
   however, PAS respired more from its small aggregates than expected from
   their OC content. The results showed that OC turnover and loss of
   aggregation was very fast in this soil, but soil hydraulic properties
   were affected in the longer term. Dry aggregates were found to useful
   for studying soil degradation, and they showed similar trends as those
   indicated in the literature for water stable aggregates. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from agricultural
   activities prompted the need to quantify greenhouse gas emissions to
   better understand carbon (C) cycling and its role in environmental
   quality. The specific objective of this work was to determine the effect
   of no-tillage, deep plowing and wind speeds on the Soil CO2
   concentration in muck (organic) soils of the Florida Everglades.
   Miniature infrared gas analyzers were installed at 30 cm and recorded
   every 15 min in muck soil plowed with the Harrell Switch Plow (HSP) to
   41 cm and in soil Not Tilled (NT), i.e., not plowed in last 9 months.
   The Soil CO2 concentration exhibited temporal dynamics independent of
   barometric pressure fluctuations. Loosening the soil resulted in a very
   rapid decline in CO2 concentration as a result of ``wind-induced{''} gas
   exchange from the soil surface. Higher wind speeds during mid-day
   resulted in a more rapid loss of CO2 from the HSP than from the NT
   plots. The subtle trend in the NT plots was similar, but lower in
   magnitude. Tillage-induced change in soil air porosity enabled wind
   speed to affect the gas exchange and soil CO2 concentration at 30 cm,
   literally drawing the CO2 out of the soil resulting in a rapid decline
   in the CO2 concentration, indicating more rapid soil carbon loss with
   tillage. At the end of the study, CO2 concentrations in the NT plots
   averaged about 3.3\% while that in the plowed plots was about 1.4\%.

   quantitative model involving different soil functions which were used to
   convert soil parameters to a 0 to 1 scale. The normalized values were
   then multiplied by appropriate weighing factors based on relative
   importance and sensitivity analysis of each indicator. Based on overall
   assessment, each soil mapping unit was categorized into soil groups I,
   II or III. A general guideline of USDA - Natural Resource Conservation

Abstract = {{Recently, it has been suggested that soil organic C (SOC) does not
   always respond linearly to increasing C input, thereby limiting the rate
   and efficiency of C stabilization in soils. Therefore, we postulated
   that when a soil is exposed to a broad range of C inputs through a range
   of manure treatments, it will show C saturation behavior and different
   SOC pools will saturate at different rates. To test this, different SOC
   pools were isolated by physical fractionation techniques from a
   long-term agricultural experiment in Lethbridge, Canada. In this
   experiment, manure has been applied since 1973 at rates of 0, 60, 120,
   and 180 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (wet weight). In the total mineral soil as well
   as the small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu
   m), and the silt plus clay fraction (<53 mu m), an increase was observed
   in SOC contents with an increase in manure application rate to 120 Mg
   ha(-1)yr(-1). However, no additional C was sequestered when the manure
   application rate was augmented to 180 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), indicating C
   saturation in these SOC pools. Large macroaggregates (>2000 mu m) were
   the only water-stable aggregate fraction that increased in C content
   across all manure input levels. Further physical separation of
   macroaggregates into subpools by microaggregate isolation showed that
   coarse (>250 mu m) particulate organic matter (POM) was the fraction
   that accounted most for the increase in C content of the large
   macroaggregates. Furthermore, the turnover of large macroaggregates
   increased with increasing manure applications, as indicated by decreased
   formation and stabilization of intramicroaggregate POM within the large
   macroaggregates. We conclude that as C input increases, the mineral
   fraction of a soil saturates and consequently additional C input will
   only accumulate in labile soil C pools that have a relatively faster
   turnover.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess long-term effects on productivity, environmental
   impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six
   cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to
   organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared
   since 1989 on a loam soil. A decline in soil structure quality was found
   in a conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational
   grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than
   other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate
   stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys
   in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The
   latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable
   system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an
   arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring,
   organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found.
   This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small
   aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall
   increases in earthworm density (84\%), earthworm biomass (80\%) and the
   density of earthworm channels (132\%) in the topsoil between 1994 and
   2004. Most of these increases were found in systems with 1-3 years of
   ley in the 4-year rotation. Low values of all earthworm parameters, and
   only minor changes over the period studied, were found in two
   non-organic arable systems without ley, indicating high pressure on soil
   fauna. Lower earthworm activity was found in the non-organic arable
   system with reduced tillage as compared to the non-organic arable system
   with annual ploughing. Thus, 50\% leys in the rotation appeared
   desirable for the maintenance of satisfactory soil structure and
   earthworm activity. Though the deterioration of soil structure in the
   conventional arable system was not extreme, as the soil was well
   structured initially, the results may have implications for the
   sustainability of stockless arable systems on soils with a less
   favourable initial structure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Arenosols cover about 13\% in Sub-Saharan Africa and are widely spread
   in the southern part of the continent. Knowledge about the spatial
   distribution, properties, and land cover of Arenosols can be used to
   design programs to alleviate the major constraints for agricultural
   production. This article reviews the importance of Arenosols in eight
   countries of Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
   Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe). Estimates of their
   extent are based on SOTER databases. The total extent of Arenosols in
   the eight countries is 169 million ha: extensively in Angola and
   Botswana (>50\% of total land area) but also in Zimbabwe, South Africa,
   and Mozambique (>15\% of total land area). About 26.3 million ha of
   Arenosols are under forest; 104.7 million ha under savannah and 3.5
   million ha is desert and dunes. In total, 6.5 million ha of Arenosols
   are under agriculture cropland, most of which is located in Angola,
   Botswana, and South Africa. Arenosol topsoils in Namibia and South
   Africa are mostly alkaline but in Angola and Zimbabwe, the average
   topsoil pH of Arenosols is below 6. Organic carbon is uniformly low in
   Arenosols of Southern Africa and rarely exceeds 10 g kg(-1). Higher C
   contents are found in soils with slightly higher clay content, whereas
   higher C levels are also associated with higher cation exchange
   capacities (CECs). The low CEC and low water-holding capacity
   necessitates the addition of organic manures to increase agricultural

   post-reclamation land uses (e.g., forest, hay and pasture) on selected
   physical properties of soil in relation to undisturbed forest and
   agricultural land use. Soil samples were collected from the 0- to 5-, 5-

   distribution, bulk density, water-stable aggregates, mean-weight
   diameter and soil moisture retention. Cone index and infiltration rate

   density in the surface layer of all land uses in the reclaimed mine soil
   (RMS) was similar to that of undisturbed forest (1.1 Mg m(-3)) but lower
   than that of agricultural soils (1.3 Mg m(-3)). However, soil bulk
   density at lower depths was not affected. The cone index was higher in
   the RMS-pasture (2.6 MPa) than the RMS-forest (1.4 MPa) and RMS-hay (1.5
   MPa) due to the trampling effect of grazing animals. The water-stable
   aggregates (>2 mm), of 5-8 mm aggregates, were higher in RMS-forest by

   5 min in RMS under forest, hay and pasture were less by 20\%, 53\% and
   85\%, respectively, than that under undisturbed forest (19.3 cm
   min(-1)). The reclamation of mine soils with forest and hay improved
   surface soil bulk density and cone index, and enhanced water
   infiltration capacity and water-stable aggregates at the lower depths.
   Therefore, establishment of forest and hay should be encouraged in the

Abstract = {{Researchers from Colorado State University, in collaboration with
   scientists from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
   initiated a long-term multi-disciplinary study in precision agriculture
   in 1997. Site-specific management zones (SSMZ) were investigated as a
   means of improving nitrogen management in irrigated maize cropping
   systems. The objective was to develop precise nutrient management
   strategies for semi-arid irrigated cropping systems. This study was
   conducted in five fields in northeastern Colorado, USA. Two techniques
   for delineating management zones were developed and compared: SSMZ and
   yield-based management zones (YBMZ). Nitrogen uptake and grain yield
   differences among SSMZs were compared as were soil properties. Both
   management zone techniques were used to divide fields into smaller units
   that were different with regard to productivity potential (e.g., high
   zones had high productivity potential while low zones had low
   productivity potential). Economic analysis was also performed. Based on
   grain yield productivity, the SSMZs performed better than the YBMZ
   technique in most cases. Grain yield and N uptake between the low and
   high productivity management zones were statistically different for most
   site-years and N fertilizer rates (p < 0.05). Soil properties helped to
   explain the productivity potential of the management zones. The low SSMZ
   was markedly different from the high SSMZ based on bulk density, organic
   carbon, sand, silt, porosity and soil moisture. Net returns ranged from
   188 to 679 USD ha(-1). In two out of three site-years the variable yield
   goal strategy resulted in the largest net returns. In this study, the
   SSMZ approach delineates areas of different productivity accurately
   across the agricultural fields. The SSMZs are different with regard to
   soil properties as well as grain yield and N uptake. Site-specific
   management zones are an inexpensive and pragmatic approach to precise N
   management in irrigated maize.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its food production and environmental buffering functions, soil
   is considered a strategic target by the European Union and its quality
   evaluation could be used as an effective index of sustainability. The
   evolution of some soil chemical parameters has been studied in two
   long-term trials established in the early 1960s in north-eastern Italy:
   one (SF) comparing nutrient management treatments (i.e. organic, mineral
   and mixed fertilizers) in lysimeters containing widely contrasting soil
   types (i.e. sand, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field
   study with crop rotation, nutrient (organic vs. mineral fertilizers),
   and management intensity variables. Soil was analysed for Olsen
   phosphorus (P-av), exchangeable cations (K-ex, Na-ex, Mg-ex, and Ca-ex)
   and salinity, evaluated by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). A
   bi-factorial quality index based on fuzzy logic was then tested and
   applied to assess the overall soil quality and its evolution in the
   cropping systems. A minimum dataset of chemical (pH, organic carbon,
   cation exchange capacity, P-av and K-ex) and physical parameters
   (available water content and water-filled porosity) was used to
   elaborate the index. In general, the use of organic fertilizer resulted
   in higher P-av, K-ex and Mg-ex concentrations than the mineral
   treatments at the same levels, whereas no differences for Na-ex and
   Ca-ex were observed. Salinity level was not influenced by the organic
   treatments probably because the consistent water drainage in the area
   prevented salt accumulation. The soil quality index represented the soil
   productivity function, explaining up to 74\% of yield variability. Index
   comparison highlighted the positive role of organic and mixed
   fertilizations in increasing and maintaining the soil quality. The
   bi-factorial index of soil quality based on a minimum dataset is a good
   tool for the policy maker to evaluate the effects of management
   practices. However, standardization and accuracy of the soil analyses
   are important to reduce sources of variability that could have a strong
   influence on the soil quality evaluation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Quantitative knowledge of stabilizationand decomposition processes is
   necessary to understand, assess and predict effects of land use changes
   on storage and stability of soil organic carbon ( soil C) in the
   tropics. Although it is well documented that different soil types have
   different soil C stocks, it is presently unknown how different soil
   types affect the stability of recently formed soil C. Here, we analyze
   the main controls of soil C storage in the top 0.1 m of soils developed
   on Tertiary sediments and soils developed on volcanic ashes. Using a
   combination of fractionation techniques with C-13 isotopes analyses we
   had the opportunity to trace origin and stability of soil carbon in
   different aggregate fractions under pasture and secondary forest. Soil C
   contents were higher in volcanic ash soils ( 47 - 130 g kg(-1)) than in
   sedimentary soils ( 19 - 50 g kg(-1)). Mean residence time ( MRT) of
   forest- derived carbon in pastures increased from 37 to 57 years with
   increasing silt + clay content in sedimentary soils, but was independent
   from soil properties in volcanic ash soils. MRTs of pasture- derived
   carbon in secondary forests were considerably shorter, especially in
   volcanic ash soils, where no pasture- derived carbon could be detected
   in any of the four studied secondary forests. The implications of these
   results are that the MRT of recently incorporated organic carbon depends
   on clay mineralogy and is longer in soils dominated by smectite than
   non- crystalline minerals. Our results show that the presence of soil C
   stabilization processes, does not necessarily mean that recent
   incorporated soil C will also be effectively stabilized.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry and grass buffers can improve infiltration and reduce

   examine buffer effects on soil porosity using high-resolution x-ray
   computed tomography (CT). Treatments Studied were agroforestry buffer,
   grass buffer, and row crop (RC) on a Putnam silt loam (fine, smectitic,
   mesic Vertic Albaqualf). A no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean {[}Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.] rotation was established in 199 1, with buffers
   implemented in 1997. Agroforestry buffers, 4.5 in wide and 36.5 in
   apart, consisted of pin oak (Quercus palustris Munchh.) trees planted
   among redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth) and brome (Bromus spp.) grasses
   and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Two replicates of intact
   soil cores (76-mm diam. by 76-mm long) were collected from the 0- to
   100-mm depth. Cores were scanned at a voxel size of 73 by 73 by 84 Pro.
   Images were analyzed with Three-Dimensional Medial Axis (3DMA) software.
   The average pore paths for grass and agroforestry buffer samples were
   three and five times greater, respectively, than for RC. On average,
   buffer samples had a 33\% higher characteristic coordination number than
   RC samples. Buffer samples had a.higher characteristic path length
   constant (2.18 times the RC treatment) and an average lower path
   tortuosity (89\% of the RC treatment) relative to values for RC. Average
   nodal pore volume and throat radii of buffers were 1.8 and 2.9 times
   larger, respectively, than for RC. Results show that three-dimensional
   structural differences caused by variations in root growth or organic
   matter accumulation discriminated between buffer and row crop soil,

Abstract = {{The widespread use of heavy equipment during timber harvesting and site

   development of new methods to assess compaction. We evaluated the
   effects of soil particle density, organic matter, particle size
   distribution, extractable oxides, and plastic and liquid limits on the
   maximum bulk density (MBD) of forest soils in British Columbia. Soil
   samples were collected from 33 sites throughout British Columbia,
   covering the major forest and soil types of the province. The standard
   Proctor test was used to determine MBD and related parameters, including
   the gravimetric water content (W-MBD) and porosity (f(MBD)) at which MBD
   was achieved. The significance levels of single soil properties in
   predicting MBD were in the order plastic and liquid limits, organic
   matter, oxalate-extractable oxides, and particle size distribution. For
   all samples, liquid limit and clay were most closely related to MBD (R-2
   = 0.83). Addition of organic matter to the model increased the
   regression coefficients, and oxidizable organic matter caused a greater
   increase than did total C. Stratification of the sample set into groups
   based on plasticity led to higher R2 values in multiple regressions, and
   different soil properties were important for nonplastic soils than for
   those with high, moderate, and low plasticity. Prediction with multiple
   regression explained the most variation in MBD for nonplastic soils,
   while properties of highly plastic soils explained the least variation
   in MBD and moderately plastic soils were intermediate. Based on our
   findings, we propose an approach for using MBD to help better interpret
   bulk density data in forest soil compaction studies.}},

Abstract = {{The intensive use of soils derived from volcanic ash, due to an increase
   in livestock and agricultural activities, has generated losses from
   increasing water erosion in the soils, which are reflected in lower
   production and an increase in the demand for agricultural inputs.
   Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate, after three years, the
   structural state of a soil (Typic Haploxerand) subjected to four
   techniques for managing crop residues under zero tillage in wheat-oat
   rotation: 1) burned residues (T); 2) residues in rows (RH); 3) standing
   residues (RP); and 4) chopped residues (RPC). The evaluated variables
   were soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregates stability measured by mean
   weight diameter (MWD), distribution of water stable aggregates,
   saturated water conductivity (K-s), bulk density (D-a), and resistance
   to penetration (Rp). The experimental design was complete random blocks
   and means were compared with the Tukey test (p <= 0.05). The results
   showed a low MWD (0.20 to 0.28 mm) and a dominance of water stable
   fractions smaller than 0.25 mm that was above 66\% in all of the
   treatments. This suggests that the structural system is susceptible to
   physical degradation; RP and RPC had better structural stability and a
   higher proportion (p <= 0.05) of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm), as well as
   a significant increase in SOC (p <= 0.05). The treatment RPC had
   significantly lower values of K, (0.76 cm h(-1)), D-a and Rp, which is

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Abstract = {{Forest and grassland soils in north-eastern Iran are being degraded and
   destroyed by inappropriate agricultural activities. This study
   investigated effects of land-use changes on several indicators of soil
   quality (SQ) in this area. We found higher organic carbon (OC) and total
   nitrogen (N) contents in virgin soils (under forests and pastures) than
   in cultivated soils. Distribution of OC throughout the soil profile was
   influenced by the type and length of tillage operations performed at
   different sites. Cultivation reduced OC content of the subsoil
   (0.50-1.00 m) and contributed to a more uniform distribution of organic
   matter in the plough layer (0-0.50 m) by mixing upper and lower horizon
   soils and incorporating of organic inputs to a greater depth. In 4 of 5
   sites, tilled soils had lower ECe and SAR values than the virgin soils,
   but when the water table was near the soil surface, the ECe and SAR
   values were higher in cultivated sites. This suggests that when the
   water table is deep, the quality of salt-affected virgin soils may be
   improved by cultivation and leaching of excess salts to deeper layers.
   In 4 of 5 sites, the virgin soils had slightly greater clay content than
   the tilled soils, but these soils also had 41-89\% less dispersible clay
   than their cultivated counterparts. The virgin soils had 2-31-fold
   greater aggregate stability, 4-33\% lower bulk density, 6-31\% higher
   water-holding capacity (at 0.3 bar suction), higher cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), and higher respiration rate than the cultivated soils.
   The results of this study indicate that frequent tillage and use of
   summer fallow deteriorates SQ by decreasing SOC and enhancing soil
   erosion through decreased structural stability and increased
   mechanically dispersible clay. The results stress the need for farming
   practices that preserve OC in soils in order to reduce flooding and
   erosion risks.}},

Abstract = {{Soil management practices that increase soil carbon sequestration can

   of manure (FYM) and inorganic (NPK) fertilizers on soil aggregate

   treatments: inorganic fertilizer in combination with farmyard manure
   (FYM + NPK), fertilizer only (NPK), farmyard manure only (FYM) and a
   control receiving neither NPK nor FYM were studied. Results indicate
   that long-term application of manure with or without NPK improved
   aggregate stability by increasing mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry
   aggregate and fraction of dry aggregate > 2.0 mm. Higher values of MWD
   were also recorded in the water-stable aggregate size distributions for
   soils amended with either FYM or NPK. Soils amended with FYM + NPK
   sequestered more SOC than all other treatments. There was a low, but
   significant positive correlation between MWD of dry aggregates and SOC.
   Highest values of SOC were recorded in the > 2.0 mm aggregate fractions.
   This tendency towards greater SOC concentration for > 2.0 mm dry
   aggregate is suggestive of the effectiveness of this aggregate size
   range to sequester SOC in savanna Alfisols. These results demonstrate
   that continuous application of soil amendments like FYM and NPK over a
   long-term promotes soil aggregate stability and long-term SOC
   sequestration. Hence, for sustainable production in savanna Alfisols,
   there is a need to design policies that will promote soil aggregate
   stability and long-term carbon sequestration under continuous
   cultivation. Such policies must give attention to soil management
   practices that maintain higher level of SOC. Here, FYM with or without
   NPK was essential to increase stability of dry aggregates and SOC
   sequestration. However, the NPK amended soils possess higher fraction of

Abstract = {{The rehabilitation of indurate pyroclastic formations of the Ecuadorian
   Sierra (cangahua) paves the way for the development of new agricultural
   areas. The material derived from the fragmentation of the hardened
   volcanic ashes is strongly prone to pluvial erosion, essentially because
   it has a fine silty-sandy texture, and because contains no organic
   matter and no clay minerals. Rainfall simulation was implemented before
   and after three cycles of cultivation to asses the evolution of soil
   structure and its susceptibility to erosion. The cultivated plots were <
   1\% slope and the rainfall simulation tests were conducted after the
   harvest on bare surfaces. Two soil preparations, (coarse and fine) and
   four different agricultural practices, (organic matter, green manure,
   mineral fertilization, and zero fertilization) were evaluated; as well
   reference/control plots (uncultivated bare plots).
   Surface soil crusting occurred rapidly within the cultivated plots when
   compared to the recent tilled cangahua. Runoff and soil loss were
   generally higher on plots with lower structural stability and generally
   exhibited higher clay content. In agreement with the structural
   stability measured in a laboratory, organic matter inputs increase the
   soil porosity. This condition had no effect on the structural stability
   of the soil, resistance to crusting, and therefore little impact on
   surface runoff and erosion. The preferred option for land with these
   soils would be no tillage and a permanent soil cover (pasture) if they
   were to be utilised for agriculture. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Managing soil water to improve rainfed agriculture in India}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-75}},
Abstract = {{Rainfed agriculture is practiced on two-thirds of the total cropland
   area of 162 million hectares (Mha) in India. While yield and total
   productivity of irrigated crops have improved since the 1960s, those of
   rainfed crops or dry farming have stagnated. Yet, the average crop yield
   under rainfed conditions in research and demonstration plots is two to
   four times higher than the national average crop yields. Low crop yields
   under rainfed conditions are due to recurring drought stress, high soil
   temperatures, widespread soil degradation and desertification, and poor
   management. Soil-related constraints that exacerbate drought stress
   include crusting and compaction, low water infiltration rate, low water
   retention capacity, high surface runoff, and high losses due to soil
   evaporation. India receives about 400 X 10(6) ha-m of rainfall annually,
   most of which is received in 100 hours over a span of 25 nonconsecutive
   rain days. Thus, 45\% (or 180 x 10(6) ha-m) is lost as runoff or blue
   water. Some of the water stored in soil as green water is lost by soil
   evaporation, and the productive green water used as direct transpiration
   is rather small. Impedance to deep root penetration due to high bulk
   density, low porosity, and hard-setting are among important factors
   responsible for low fraction of ``productive green water.{''}
   Recommended management practices (RMPs) that conserve water in the root
   zone and increase water use efficiency (WUE) are: (i) plowing of deep
   compacted soils with massive structure and low porosity, (ii) using a
   minimum or no-till system in light-textured soils with favorable
   structure, (iii) mulching with crop residues, other biosolids, and
   synthetic polymers, (iv) harvesting runoff water and recycling it for
   supplemental irrigation, and (v) adopting integrated farming systems
   involving legume-based rotations and agroforestry measures, which reduce
   water runoff and improve soil fertility. Available research results

Abstract = {{Knowledge on chemical and physical soil features in mountainous areas is
   very important for sustainable planning of natural resources. Thus, this
   study aimed to determine the soil chemical and physical attributes of an
   Inceptisol under different land uses, in Visconde do Rio Branco, in the
   Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais state. Five land uses were evaluated:
   orange, rubber tree, sugar-cane, pasture and forestry. Rubber tree,
   orange and pasture were cultivated during 15 years, and sugar-cane for
   1.5 years. Prior to these uses the area had been cultivated with
   sugarcane for about a century. Sampling was carried out in three
   replicates (soil pits) at depths of 0-20 and 20-40 cm. The following
   chemical attributes were determined: soil organic matter (MOS); pH in
   H2O, P, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, A1(3+), H+Al, SB, CEC(t), CEC pH 7.0 (T), BS,
   aluminum saturation (m), P-rem. The following physical attributes were
   measured: texture, bulk density, particle density, porosity, water
   retention curve, soil penetration resistance and agkregate stability, as
   well as the ratios of available water / total porosity and field
   capacity/total porosity. Results showed that the soil fertility is low
   and exchangeable Al3+ very high under all land uses, apart from
   sugarcane, with medium values of soil fertility and negligible levels of
   exchangeable aluminum. The agricultural use decreased MOS. Land uses
   with rubber tree and sugarcane improved the soil physical properties to
   values comparable with the native site. On the other hand, in areas
   under orange and pasture the soil bulk density and resistance increased
   compared to the other land uses, while the aggregate stability and
   porosity decreased.}},

Abstract = {{A stationary field trial was set up at the Vezaiciai Branch of the
   Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in 2003. The soil of the
   experimental site is Dystrict Albeluvisol (texture sandy light loam).
   The objective of the study was to estimate the effects of primary soil
   tillage methods on the changes in the soil structure; chemical, and
   biological soil properties. The field trial involved two factors: factor
   A - deep ploughing; shallow ploughing; shallow tillage in the autumn.
   Factor B - different organic fertilisers - green manure of perennial
   grasses, straw and manure incorporation in the crop rotation: winter
   wheat-spring rape - spring barley, and red clover. The herbage of the
   first cut and aftermath for green manure and farmyard manure were
   incorporated in the respective plots.
   The experimental findings of the first crop rotation during the period
   2004-2007 are summarised in this paper. Each year, after crop harvesting
   the soil was limed by 400 kg ha(-1) CaCO(3). At the end of a four-year
   crop rotation in the deep and shallow ploughed soil the pH level
   increased by 0.2 units, while in the sallow tillage soil the pH value
   did not change compared with the initial level before the trial
   establishment. A reduction in organic carbon and nutrient content in the
   shallow tillage topsoil 10-20 cm layer was established. Deep and shallow
   ploughed soil was rich in phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen. The
   highest amount of nutrients was determined in the deep and shallow
   ploughed topsoil (0-10 cm) layer. After cultivation the structure of
   moraine loam soil deteriorated. A reduction in the content of water
   stable aggregates (>0.25 mm) by 4-7 per cent units in the tilled soil
   was identified compared with the ploughless tillage soil.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) gradually accumulates in surface soils if there is a
   continuous input of inorganic P fertilizers, manures and composts. In
   turn, P is lost from soil through runoff and leaching, which lead to
   increased P concentrations in surface and ground waters. Previous work
   showed that, in Northern European agricultural soils, below a certain
   Olsen P concentration (P extractable in 0.5 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5), there was
   little or no P leaching or 0.01 M extractable-CaCl2 Soil P (a surrogate
   for P leaching). However, at above this soil P concentration (termed the
   `Change Point') there was a linear relationship between P loss and soil
   Olsen P concentration. The aim of the work described here was to attempt
   to characterize the `Change Point' in a range of Chinese soils, to
   determine the maximum soil P concentrations that should be permitted
   before P leaching would occur. Accordingly, 23 soils were sampled from
   arable land in 13 Chinese provinces. Organic carbon, pH, cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), < 0.01 mm and < 0.002 mm clay particle size fractions,
   exchangeable Ca and Mg, and oxalate-extractable Al and Fe were measured
   in air-dried and sieved (< 2 mm)soils. The maximum P adsorption capacity
   (Qm) and P adsorption affinity (K) were calculated from the Langmiur
   equation. Following the addition of increasing P concentrations (ranging
   from 0 to 400 mg P kg(-1) soil as KH2PO4), the soils were adjusted to
   50\% water holding capacity (WHC) and then incubated at 25 degrees C for
   4 days. After three cycles of air-drying, incubation and rewetting, the
   `Change Points' ranged from about 30 to 160 mg P kg(-1) soil,
   corresponding to 0.02-0.75 ing CaCl2-P 1(-1). Below pH 6.0, the `Change
   Points' increased with soil pH (minimum around 30 mg P kg(-1) soil), but
   decreased above pH 6.0. The highest `Change Points' were found in soils
   of about pH 6.0 (maximum about 96, with one outlier of 156 mg P kg(-1)
   soil). The `Change Points' were positively correlated with soil organic
   carbon concentration (R-2=0. 50) and amorphous Fe (R-2=0.46).
   Correlations were closer in the soils below pH 6,0 than in the soils
   above pH 6.0. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many states of central Mexico, hardened volcanic materials called
   tepetate (hardened layers from tuff) cover large proportions of the land
   surface, and are therefore of economic and social importance. Under
   natural conditions, tepetates are unproductive due to their hardness and
   low porosity, but they can be used agriculturally after the hardened
   layer is broken up and fertilizer and organic matter are added Just
   broken up tepetate consists of angular clods of the original
   consolidated material of various sizes and they are devoided of
   aggregate. Because of the scarce presence of organic matter these
   fragmented tepetates present low availability of N and P, limited water
   infiltration, and small water holding capacity Additions of manure and
   cultivation of Leguminosae aim to improve the physical properties of
   tepetates and particularly to promote the formation of aggregates. Such
   ameliorated tepetates alleviate the demand for agricultural land. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the formation of aggregates from
   initially broken zip and fragmented tepetates, their dry and wet
   stability, and the distribution of organic carbon in aggregates and
   fragments of different sizes in tepetates cultivated between 1 and 100
   years. The tepetates were were arbitrarily classified as (I) recently
   broken up; (II) affected by severe erosion: (III) cultivated mostly
   under monoculture: (IV) cultivated with Leguminosae for at least 20
   years and receiving approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of farm yard manure (FYM)
   per year; (V) cultivated under no-tillage and few external inputs; (VI)
   cultivated with cereals and Leguminosae and receiving more than
   Mg.ha(-1) per year of FYM; (VII) Used as greenhouse bed; (VIII)
   cultivated with no-tillage and approximately 5 to 10 Mg.ha(-1) of FYM;
   (IX) used as greenhouse bed and addition of approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of
   composted wood residues per year In addition to the above mentioned
   tepetates, two agricultural soils: one managed with traditional tillage
   (A) and a second with no tillage (IX) were included as checks. We
   collected 97 samples of tepetates and four soils in the Basin of the Rio
   Texcoco and neighboring communities. The aggregate stability test
   overestimated stable aggregates due to the presence of remaining hard
   fragments of tepetates of different size; the hardness of the latter was
   one to three times greater than that of the aggregates. The relative
   amount of stable aggregates increased with the time of cultivation,
   approaching 80\% after 100 years. The recently broken zip tepetates
   contained only little of C, whereas stable aggregates showed one to
   three times larger concentration. The accumulation of C with time in
   tepetate fragments was small, in contrast to the aggregates formed in
   the same period. The accumulation of organic C was larger in smaller
   aggregate particles and followed logarithmic or potential models. The
   results of this study show that ameliorated tepetates have the potential
   to store carbon. However the accumulated amount of C depend on the
   aggregate formation, which in turn is related with the agricultural
   management. Classes VII, VIII y IX produced more stable aggregates and
   thus aecumulated more carbon.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is essentially defined by
   the way in which it is obtained. Therefore, we need to understand as to
   how pre-treatment of a soil will affect the characteristics of DOM,
   since this fraction may be strongly influenced by a soil's water
   content. The effect of two different pre-treatments on DOM from the
   A-horizons of a large variety of ecosystems and regions were compared.
   In both cases the soils were allowed to air-dry. In one case the
   air-dried soil was directly extracted (AD), while in the other case it
   was pre-incubated for I week at 50\% of its water holding capacity
   (INCU). AD is simpler, but INCU brings the soil, and especially its
   microbial population, back to a standardised state, which is more
   representative of the Usual state in the field. Both methods are used
   whenever an adjustment of the soil water content is essential to compare
   different regions or to eliminate short term weather effects. A
   significant regression indicated that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   extracted from INCU samples was only 20\% of AD DOC. Both the
   absorptivity (UV absorption divided by DOC) of 86\% of the samples, and
   a fluorescence emission spectrum based Humification Index in all cases
   increased as a result of pre-incubation. This would indicate that labile
   compounds released during drying were metabolised during the incubation.
   However, the magnitude of this increase varied, and no correlation with
   soil organic and microbial carbon, pH, or texture could be detected. The
   results show that DOM extracted from AD and INCU soils is not comparable
   and that the differences are mainly due to the impact of air-drying on
   the microbial activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil fertility, one of the important determinants of agricultural
   productivity, is generally thought to be supplemented through the
   application of nutrients mainly through inorganic fertilizers. The
   physical fertility of the soil, which creates suitable environment for
   the availability and uptake of these nutrients, is generally ignored.
   The present study aims to characterize the soil physical environment in
   relation to the long term application of farm yard manure (FYM) and
   inorganic fertilizers in rice-wheat. The treatments during both rice and
   wheat crops were (i) farm yard manure @ 20 t ha(-1) (FYM); (ii) nitrogen
   @ 120 kg ha(-1) (N-120); (iii) nitrogen and phosphorus @ 120 and 30 kg
   ha(-1)(N120P30) ) and (iv) nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium @ 120, 30
   and 30 (N120P30K30) in addition to (iv) control treatment, i.e. without
   any fertilizer and/or FYM addition. The treatments were replicated four
   times in randomized block design in a sandy loam (typic Ustipsament,
   non-saline, slightly alkaline). Bulk density, structural stability of
   soil aggregates and water holding capacity of 0-60 cm soil layer were
   measured.
   The average mean weight diameter (MWD) was highest in FYM-plots both in
   rice (0.237 mm) and wheat (0.249 mm) closely followed by that in
   N120P30K30 plots. The effect of FYM in increasing the MWD decreased with
   soil depth. The addition of both FYM and N120P30K30 increased the
   organic carbon by 44 and 37\%, respectively in rice. The total porosity
   of soil increased with the application of both FYM and N120P30K30 from
   that in control plots. In 0-15 cm soil layer, the total porosity
   increased by 25\% with FYM from that in control plots. This difference
   decreased to 13\% in 15-30 cm soil layer. The average water holding
   capacity (WHC) was 16 and 11\% higher with FYM and N120P30K30
   application from that in control plots. The MWD, total porosity and WHC
   improved with the application of balanced application of fertilizers.
   The grain yield and uptake of N, P and K by both rice and wheat were
   higher with the application of FYM and inorganic fertilizers than in
   control plots. The carbon sequestration rate after 32 years was maximum
   (0.31 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in FYM-plots, followed by 0.26 t ha(-1)
   year(-1) in N120P30K30-Plots, 0.19 t ha(-1) year(-1) in N120P30 and

Abstract = {{Although agricultural land management is known to affect near-surface
   soil physical quality (SPQ), the characteristics of these affects are
   poorly understood, and diagnostic SPQ indicators are not well-developed.
   The objective of this study was to measure a suite of potential SPQ
   indicators using intact soil cores and grab samples collected from the
   0-10 cm depth of a clay loam soil with the treatments: (i) virgin soil
   (VS): (ii) long-term continuous bluegrass sod (BG); (iii) long-term
   maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation under
   no-tillage (NT); (iv) long-term maize-soybean rotation under mouldboard
   plough tillage (MP); (v) short-term (1-4 years) NT after long-term MP;
   (vi) short-term MP after long-term BG; (vii) short-term MP after
   long-term NT. Organic carbon content, dry bulk density, air capacity,
   relative water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity appeared to
   be useful SPQ indicators because they were sensitive to land management,
   and proposed optimum or critical values are available in the literature.
   Soil macroporosity was also sensitive to land management, but optimum or
   critical values for this parameter are not yet established. Soil matrix
   porosity and plant-available water capacity did not respond
   substantially or consistently to changes in land management, and were
   thus not useful as SPQ indicators in this study. Converting long-term BG
   to MP caused overall SPQ to decline to levels similar to lone-term MP
   within 3-4 years. Converting long-term NT to MP or vice versa caused
   only minor changes in overall SPQ. With respect to the measured SPQ
   indicators and their optimum or critical values, both VS and BG produced
   ``good{''} overall SPQ in the near-surface soil. while long-term
   maize-soybean rotation under NT and MP produced equally ``poor{''} SPQ.

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in ecosystem function,
   determining soil fertility, water holding capacity and susceptibility to
   land degradation. In addition, SOC is related to atmospheric CO, levels
   with soils having the potential for C release or sequestration,
   depending on land use, land management and climate. The United Nations
   Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, and other United
   Nations Conventions to Combat Desertification and on Biodiversity all
   recognize the importance of SOC and point to the need for quantification
   of SOC stocks and changes. An understanding of SOC stocks and changes at
   the national and regional scale is necessary to further our
   understanding of the global C cycle, to assess the responses of
   terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and to aid policy makers in
   making land use/management decisions. Several studies have considered
   SOC stocks at the plot scale, but these are site specific and of limited
   value in making inferences about larger areas. Some studies have used
   empirical methods to estimate SOC stocks and changes at the regional
   scale, but such studies are limited in their ability to project future
   changes, and most have been carried out using temperate data sets. The
   computational method outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) has been used to estimate SOC stock changes at the
   regional scale in several studies, including a recent study considering
   five contrasting eco regions. This `one step' approach fails to account
   for the dynamic manner in which SOC changes are likely to occur
   following changes in land use and land management.
   A dynamic modelling approach allows estimates to be made in a manner
   that accounts for the underlying processes leading to SOC change.
   Ecosystem models, designed for site scale applications can be linked to
   spatial databases, giving spatially explicit results that allow
   geographic areas of change in SOC stocks to be identified. Some studies
   have used variations on this approach to estimate SOC stock changes at
   the sub-national and national scale for areas of the USA and Europe and
   at the watershed scale for areas of Mexico and Cuba. However, a need
   remained for a national and regional scale, spatially explicit system
   that is generically applicable and can be applied to as wide a range of
   soil types, climates and land uses as possible. The Global Environment
   Facility Soil Organic Carbon (GEFSOC) Modelling System was developed in
   response to this need. The GEFSOC system allows estimates of SOC stocks
   and changes to be made for diverse conditions, providing essential
   information for countries wishing to take part in an emerging C market,
   and bringing us closer to an understanding of the future role of soils
   in the global C cycle. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of water scarcity and as a means of wastewater disposal,
   reuse of treated sewage effluent in irrigated agriculture is practiced
   worldwide. Among the detrimental aspects of wastewater re-use in
   agriculture is the possibility that soils will be rendered water
   repellent. The current study focuses on time dependent variation of
   infiltration rate in effluent-induced repellent soils, and time
   dependent variation in water repellency at different levels of ambient
   relative humidity (RH).
   The shape of the cumulative infiltration curve of water was found to
   depend on the repellency degree (concave for wettable and slightly
   repellent soils, convex for severely repellent soil). Compared with
   infiltration rates in the wettable and slightly repellent soils,
   infiltration rates in the severely repellent soil were very low at the
   beginning and then increased. When the liquid-vapor surface tension was
   reduced by means of ethanol addition to the infiltrating solution, the
   cumulative infiltration curve of the severely repellent soil also became
   concave.
   Repellency degree (as measured by WDPT) was found to be essentially
   constant over a large range of ambient RH values (< 10 - similar to 8 1
   \%), and to increase sharply at values above 90\%. The relative increase
   in water drop penetration time (WDPT) at high RH was greatest for the
   least repellent soil (10-fold increase in WDPT), and least for the most
   repellent soil (2-fold increase in WDPT). At RH > 90\%, the time to
   reach equilibrium with respect to WDPT and soil moisture content was
   similar. In contrast, at values of ambient RH ranging from < 10 to 81
   \%, WDPT was invariant over the course of reaching equilibrium with
   respect to moisture content. However, after reaching moisture content
   equilibrium, WDPT declined with increasing time. Copyright (c) 2007 John

Abstract = {{Agricultural biomass is a potential renewable biofuel that may partially
   replace nonrenewable fossil fuels. Corn stover is rich in cellulose and
   hemicellulose, both of which can be converted to sugars and fermented to
   ethanol. This fermentation process results in a high-lignin fermentation
   byproduct (HLFB) that could be converted to energy products or used as a
   soil amendment. We had two objectives: (i) to determine whether HLFB
   (0.1, 1.0, or 10 kg m(-2)) could improve soil properties in two soils
   with contrasting levels of soil organic carbon (SOC); and (ii) to assess
   the impact of HLFB on crop growth. These goals were addressed with
   separate experiments. In the soil experiment, two soils were amended
   with HLFB or ground corn (Zea mays L.) stover and then incubated in pots
   for 118 d. Flux of COZ was monitored and soil properties were measured
   after incubation. In the plant experiment, corn and soybean {[}Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.] were grown in pots, without amendment or amended with
   1.0 kg m(-2) corn stover or 1.0 kg m(-2) HLFB. The soil experiment
   indicated that the addition of 10 kg m(-2) HLFB increased CO2 emission,
   humic acid concentration, and water-stable aggregates, and decreased
   bulk density (D-b). No adverse impacts on crop growth were measured when
   HLFB was applied at a rate of 1.0 kg m(-2). Much of the HLFB may be used
   by the energy industry; but perhaps a percentage could be returned to
   the field to reduce the impact of corn stover removal on soil C.}},

Abstract = {{The O-18/O-16 ratio of CO2 is a potentially powerful tracer of carbon
   dioxide fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere, which is influenced by
   complex interactions involving both biotic and abiotic soil processes.
   We use a simplified experimental approach and numerical simulations to
   examine in isolation the O-18 exchange between CO2 and soil water
   associated with the abiotic invasion of atmospheric CO2 into soil. This
   allowed us to verify, in particular, whether the O-18 of the
   retro-diffusion flux of CO2 from the soil reflects O-18 equilibration
   with water at the soil surface, or at some depth. Sterile soil samples
   with known water isotopic composition were placed in a closed box
   attached to a specially designed flow chamber and the changes in delta
   O-18 of CO2 between the chamber inlet and outlet, due only to invasion
   effects, were determined. Numerical simulations constrained by the
   laboratory gas exchange measurements indicated that between the two
   commonly used diffusion models {[}Penman, H.L. (1940). Gas and vapor
   movements in soil, l: the diffusion of vapors through porous solids.
   Int. J. Agric. Sci. 30, 437-462; Moldrup, P., Olesen, T., Yamaguchi, T.,

   soils, IX, the Backingham-Burdine-Campbell equation for gas diffusivity
   in undisturbed soil. Soil Sci. 164, 542-551], only the former provided
   good agreement with the measurements over a wide range of soil water
   contents. Based on the model calculations constrained by experimental
   data, and on comparison of characteristic diffusion/reaction times, we
   conclude that the depth required for full CO2-water O-18 equilibration
   ranges between 2 and 8.5 cm. The depth depends, in order of importance,
   on (1) soil moisture content; (2) temperature, which dominates the rate
   of hydration isotopic exchange; (3) CO2 residence time, which is
   determined by the time of replacement of the column air above the soil;
   and (4) soil structure, including porosity, tortuosity and grain size,
   with the later probably influencing the water surface area exposed to
   CO2 exchange. Using field data from a semi-arid forest site in Israel,
   numerical simulations indicated that the 180 full equilibrium depth
   varied at this site between 4 cm (January) and 8 cm (November), being
   sensitive mostly to temperature and soil water content. Deepening of the
   equilibration depth as the soil dries should limit the effects of O-18
   evaporative enrichment at the surface on the isotopic composition of the
   soil-atmosphere CO2 flux. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a plot experiment in which the changes in
   physical, chemical and physico-chemical properties of a sandy soil were
   examined after amending the soil with two different composts produced
   from municipal solid wastes. Triticale (X Triticosecale), cultivated in
   a 3-y monoculture, was used as a test plant. Both composts differed in
   their concentrations of heavy metals. Composts were applied
   non-recurrently in the spring before sowing, at the rates of 18, 36, and
   72 t dry matter ha(-1). The plots without fertilization, and those
   fertilized annually with mineral nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and
   potassium (K) were used as controls. Soil samples were collected I month
   after compost application, as well as each year after harvesting.
   Application of both composts improved soil physical properties,
   associated with increasing content of organic carbon (OC). Statistically
   significant increases of total porosity, field water capacity and
   amounts of plant-available water were found only in the short time after
   compost application. Despite the fact that soil OC content decreased
   with time, a C:N ratio clearly increased in the third year after compost
   application, which was explained by a depletion of N reserve. Both
   composts caused a large increase of plant-available P, K, and magnesium
   (Mg), which was observed during the entire period of the experiment.
   Beneficial changes were also observed in soil humic substances
   composition. These were confirmed by increased humic acids content and
   humic/fulvic acid ratios. Soil cation exchange capacity and base
   saturation increased in all plots amended with composts. This effect was
   still observed I year after compost application, while in the third year
   it remained significant only at the highest compost rates. Compost
   originating from industrial areas, even if applied in low amounts,
   caused a significant increase in total concentration of soil heavy
   metals. This fact did not result, however, in any substantial changes in
   soil quality with regard to heavy metals content. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Increasing importance has been placed on the use of agricultural soils
   for the mitigation of atmospheric CO(2) through sequestration of soil C.
   Although crop productivity is sustained mainly through the application
   of organic manure in the Indian Himalayas, little information is
   available on C sequestration, C content in different aggregate size
   fractions and soil water transmission properties (infiltration and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity) as affected by long-term manure
   addition. We analyzed results of an 8-year experiment, initiated in
   1995-1996 on a silty clay loam soil, to determine the influence of
   fertilizer and fertilizer + farmyard manure (FYM) application on those
   important soil properties. The overall increase in soil organic C (SOC)
   content in the 0-45 cm soil depth in NPK + FYM treatment as compared to
   NPK and control treatments was 11.0 and 13.9 Mg C ha(-1) at the end of 8
   years, respectively. Application of FYM significantly reduced soil bulk
   density and increased mean weight diameter (MWD) and SOC contents in
   different aggregate size fractions. Soil organic C content in
   macroaggregates was greater than in microaggregates. The response of SOC
   content to FYM application was dependent upon inorganic fertilization
   and more upon balanced application of NPK than N only. Steady state
   infiltration rate under NPK + FYM (1.98 cm h(-1)) was higher than under
   unfertilized (0.72 cm h(-1)) and NPK (1.2 cm h(-1)). Soil water
   sorptivity (calculated from Philip's equation) under NPK + FYM (1.06 cm
   min(-0-5)) was higher than under NPK (0.61 cm min(-0.5)). We conclude
   that hill farmers in northern India should be encouraged to use FYM

Abstract = {{The study focused on the impact of change in land-cover types on soil
   quality inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and
   physical properties of non-disturbed and disturbed soil system. Soil
   samples were collected from major land-cover types in the mountain
   region: natural forest, grassland and cultivated land (arable). The
   natural forest served as a control against which to assess changes in
   soil properties resulting from the removal of natural vegetation or
   cultivation of soil. Soil samples were collected from 0-15 and 15-30 cm
   depth six times during the year and examined for their nutrient status,
   i.e. soil organic matter (SOM); total N (TN); available P (AP);
   available K (AK); cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH and physical
   properties like particle size distribution, bulk density (BD), and
   porosity. Significant differences among land-cover types were found for
   SOM, TN, AP; AK, CEC and pH. Soil collected from the forest had the
   highest levels of all nutrients followed by grassland while soil from
   the arable site had very low nutrient status indicated an extractive
   effect of cultivation and agricultural practices on soil. With
   significantly lower clay contents (20\%), texturally the soil of arable
   site was quite different from that of the natural forest and grassland.
   Similarly, a 13\% more BD and 12\% lower porosity showed structural
   deterioration of arable soil. The changes in clay contents, BD and
   porosity due to cultivation suggest adverse effects on environmental
   protection functions of soil. The correlation coefficient between OM to
   TN, AP, AK and CEC suggesting that within a narrow range of soil, OM may
   serves as a suitable indicator of soil quality. Natural vegetation
   appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the
   organic carbon stock and increased the nutrient status of soil and is
   therefore, important to sustain high-altitude ecosystems and reinstate
   the degraded lands in the mountain region.}},

Abstract = {{The traffic of agricultural machinery and soil compaction occur near the
   canopy of citrus trees, which increases soil physical restrictions to
   root growth. Soil management strategies include the use of permanent
   groundcover in the interrows of orange tree plantations, although the
   effects of these practices on the soil physical quality are largely
   unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of
   groundcover management systems on some indicators of soil physical
   quality for orange tree orchards. The study was performed in a long-term
   experiment with Pera' orange grafted onto `Rangpur' lime combined with
   groundcover systems, established in 1993, in the Alto Parana county,
   northwestern Parana state, Brazil, in a Typic Paleudult with a sandy
   surface horizon. Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) or perennial peanut
   (Arachis pintoi) groundcover treatments were compared with the usual
   management in which weeds are controlled by post-emergence herbicide.
   The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three
   replications. In May 2003, soil samples were collected from under and
   between the wheel tracks. The following indicators were assessed in
   undisturbed soil samples from the mid 0-15 cm layer: water content at
   field capacity, total porosity and bulk density. The data were used to
   estimate soil aeration and water storage capacity indicators. Disturbed
   soil samples were collected in the 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm depths to measure
   the organic carbon content and calculate the soil organic carbon
   stratification ratio. The soil aeration capacity, water storage capacity
   and organic carbon stratification ratio were efficient indicators to
   evaluate groundcover management systems in citrus. Bahiagrass maintained
   better soil physical conditions both under and between wheel tracks. The
   soil physical quality was negatively affected under the wheel tracks on
   perennial peanut groundcover and under the wheel tracks and between
   tracks on the usual control of spontaneous vegetation with postemergence

Abstract = {{The recent increase in conservation tillage offers the possible benefit
   of decreasing soil compaction risk by wheeling. Excessive compaction has
   damaging consequences for agriculture and the environment. Direct
   drilling is likely to change soil porosity and soil carbon content in
   the long term. This paper analyses the effect of both of these factors
   on soil mechanical strength through measurements of the compression
   index C(c), the swelling index C(s), and the pre-compression stress
   p(c){*}. Oedometer tests were performed on remoulded soils taken from an
   experiment with a wheat-maize rotation, where three soil tillage systems
   were compared over 31 years: annual mouldboard ploughing, superficial
   tillage (10 cm depth), and no tillage. The results show that initial
   structural porosity (i.e. macro-porosity) increased C(c) slightly and
   decreased p(c){*} exponentially. Consequently, the risk of compaction in
   the direct drilling systems should decrease when a decrease in soil
   porosity is found, compared with conventional systems. However, this
   change in soil porosity in direct drilling is not always observed. The
   other variables that can be influenced by tillage system, i.e. carbon
   content or soil moisture, have also been examined to assess the possible
   benefit of direct drilling on soil compaction risk. For soils with
   similar initial structural porosity, our results show that the increase
   in carbon content of the superficial soil layers in direct drilling
   systems tends to increase the soil's susceptibility to compaction by
   increasing C(c) in wet conditions and by decreasing p(c){*} in dry
   conditions. Moisture conditions at wheeling determine the degree of soil
   compaction as a function of tillage system.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-permeability models can account for the strong influence of soil
   macropores on contaminant transport, but their predictive application is
   hampered by the difficulty in estimating a priori values for the rate
   coefficient controlling lateral mass exchange between the two flow
   domains. Our aim was to investigate the possibility of estimating the
   mass transfer coefficient in the dual-permeability model MACRO from
   fundamental soil properties. To this end, we calibrated MACRO against
   transient chloride leaching tests carried out on 33 undisturbed soil
   columns taken from the topsoils of three agricultural fields,
   characterized by a wide range of texture and organic matter content. The
   global search algorithm SUFI was used to derive optimum values of the
   mass transfer coefficient in each column. A Monte Carlo procedure was
   carried out on two columns to investigate the stability of the estimates
   in the presence of potential errors in fixed parameters. Despite such
   errors, c. 50\% of the variation in mass transfer for this data set
   could be explained by two fundamental soil properties: the geometric
   mean particle size and the organic matter content. Soils of coarser
   texture and larger organic matter content were characterized by stronger
   lateral mass exchange and therefore weaker macropore flow. Harrowing and
   a 6-year grass ley also reduced the extent of non-equilibrium transport.
   Our results suggest that a robust functional description of the effects
   of soil structure on chemical transport is possible for predictive
   management applications of dual-permeability models across larger areas
   (i.e. mapping leaching risks at field, farm and catchment scales).}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring wetting-and-drying cycles often enhance aggregation
   and give rise to a stable soil structure. In comparatively dry regions,
   such as large areas of Australia, organic-matter (OM) contents in
   topsoils of arable land are usually small. Therefore, the effects of
   wetting and drying are almost solely reliant on the clay content. To
   investigate the relations between wetting-and-drying cycles,
   aggregation, clay content, and OM in the Australian environment, an
   experiment was set up to determine the relative influence of both clay
   content (23\%, 31\%, 34\%, and 38\%) and OM amendments of barley straw
   (equivalent to 3.1 t ha(-1), 6.2 t ha(-1), and 12.4 t ha(-1)) on the
   development of water-stable aggregates in agricultural soil. The
   aggregate stability of each of the sixteen composite soils was
   determined after one, three, and six wet/dry cycles and subsequent fast
   and slow prewetting and was then compared to the aggregate stabilities
   of all other composite soils.
   While a single wet/dry cycle initiated soil structural evolution in all
   composite soils, enhancing macroaggregation, the incorporation of barley
   straw was most effective for the development of water-stable aggregates
   in those soils with 34\% and 38\% clay. Repeated wetting-and-drying
   events revealed that soil aggregation is primarily based on the clay
   content of the soil, but that large straw additions also tend to enhance
   soil aggregation. Relative to untreated soil, straw additions equivalent
   to 3.1 t ha(-1) and 12.4 t ha(-1) increased soil aggregation by about
   100\% and 250\%, respectively, after three wet/dry cycles and fast
   prewetting, but were of less influence with subsequent wet/dry cycles.
   Straw additions were even more effective in aggregating soil when
   combined with slow prewetting; after three wet/dry cycles, the mean
   weight diameters of aggregates were increased by 70\% and 140\% with the
   same OM additions and by 160\% and 290\% after six wet/dry cycles,
   compared to samples without organic amendments.
   We suggest that in arable soils poor in OM and with a field texture
   grade of clay loam or finer, the addition of straw, which is often
   available from preceding crops, may be useful for improving aggregation.
   For a satisfactory degree of aggregate stability and an improved soil
   structural form, we found that straw additions of at least 6.2 t ha(-1)
   were required. However, rapid wetting of straw-amended soil will disrupt
   newly formed aggregates, and straw has only a limited ability to sustain
   structural improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the soil structure and hydraulic conductivity of an Acidic
   Red Ferrosol were measured in a long-term (1968-2003) fertiliser
   experiment on pasture in north-western Tasmania, Australia. Studies were
   initiated following observations of both softer soil surface and
   cracking on plots that had received 15 t/ha of ground agricultural
   limestone. Liming decreased penetration resistance and increased
   hydraulic conductivity. These structural improvements were associated
   with increased mean dry aggregate size, a small increase in wet
   aggregate stability, higher exchangeable calcium levels, and increased
   plant growth, but a 9\% decrease in total soil organic carbon in the
   surface 50 mm. This decrease in organic carbon was not associated with
   deterioration in soil structure, as may have been anticipated. This was
   probably because total organic C was still 82 g/kg on unlimed plots.
   Decreases in soil penetration resistance due to liming increased the
   likelihood of pugging from livestock but may improve ease of tillage.
   This research demonstrates that liming can improve the structure of a
   well-aggregated Ferrosol as well as its previously reported effects of
   increasing soil pH and yields of pasture and barley despite decreasing

Abstract = {{Soil porosity and organic matter content influence the hydrology,
   thermal status and productivity of agricultural soils. Shape, size and

   appropriate tillage and mulch management can conserve residual soil
   moisture during the post rainy season. This can play a key role in
   enhancing productivity under the rainfed ecosystem of subhumid region in
   eastern India. A field study was carried out on a fine loamy soil from
   1993-1994 to 1995-1996. Two tillage treatments were conventional
   ploughing (150 mm depth) and shallow ploughing (90 mm) depth. Each
   tillage practice was tested with three mulch management viz., no mulch,
   soil dust mulch and rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw mulch. Soil organic
   carbon, bulk density, moisture retentivity, soil temperature with
   productivity and water use pattern of barley (Hordium vulgare L.) were
   measured.
   Reduction in ploughing depth resulted in nominal increase in profile
   (0.0-1.2 m) moisture status, yield, and soil thermal status at 14:00 and
   water use efficiency (WUE). However, it decreased the magnitude of soil
   temperature in the morning (07:00). Straw mulch conserved 19-21 mm of
   moisture in the profile (1.2 m) over the unmulched condition. Both soil
   dust and rice straw mulching elevated soil thermal status at 07:00 as
   compared to unmulched condition, but this trend was reversed at 14:00.
   Straw mulching significantly increased grain yield and WUE over soil
   dust mulch and unmulched condition. Impact of straw mulch was more
   pronounced under shallow ploughing depth. Shallow tillage with rice
   straw mulching is recommended to the farmers to obtain higher level of
   yield and water use efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mechanized agriculture is increasing rapidly in the Cerrado region of
   Brazil, causing concerns about water quality, off-site impacts, and
   sustainability. Our objective was to determine the impact of tillage on
   soil biological activity and aggregate stability in an Oxisol typical to
   the region. Three different tillage practices common to the Cerrado
   region (no-till, disk harrow, and disk plow) and an area under native
   vegetation were examined. Five different soil enzyme activities, C- and
   N- mineralization, organic C, total N, and aggregate distribution were
   determined. Total N, acid phosphatase, arylamidase, and C- and
   N-mineralization were the most sensitive to changes in tillage
   management. For each of these analyses, the no-till system had greater
   concentrations or activities (18-186\%) than disk plow in the 0-5 cm
   layer. Significant differences observed in the 0-5 cm depth did not
   necessarily translate into total profile differences to a depth of 30
   cm. No-till had significantly greater levels of total N, and C- and
   N-mineralization (20-127\%) than the disk harrow system. Total N ranged
   from 1.8 to 2.2 ka m(-3); C- and N-mineralization (24-day incubation)
   ranged from 2.8 to 6.8 and 0.04 to 0.10 kg m(-3), respectively, among
   tillage systems and soil depths. Enzyme activities in all treatments
   were more strongly correlated with total soil N than with soil organic C
   (SOC), contrary to the norm in temperate soils where the stronger
   correlation is with SOC. Mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates
   was related to SOC (r = 0.73) and total N (r = 0.92), indicating that
   soil organic matter does play a significant role in stabilizing
   aggregates in Oxisols. Results indicated the importance of reducing
   tillage as a means of increasing soil biological activity of the topsoil

Abstract = {{Subsidence of drained, high organic matter Histosols in the Everglades
   Agricultural Area (EAA) is a concern for the sustainability of crop
   production in southern Florida. Histosol subsidence is primarily due to
   oxidation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms, but far less is
   known about the influence of agricultural practices. The use of shallow
   tillage, as opposed to deep tillage, combined with proper plant residue
   management, may help to reduce the present rate of subsidence and Soil
   CO2 emissions. The present study was conducted on a Lauderhill soil
   (euic, hyperthermic, Lithic Haplosaprist) previously cropped in
   sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). The objectives were to (1) determine the
   effects of tillage depth on short-term CO2 losses in a herbicide-killed
   weedy residue covered field and another field kept fallow without
   residue cover, and (2) compare soil respiration measurements made with
   two different dynamic closed-system portable chamber techniques. Four
   tillage practices common to the EAA were used to produce soil
   disturbance ranging in depth from approximately 20 to 300 mm. These
   practices included switch plowing, disk harrowing, and single and
   multiple tine cultivation. Twenty-four hours after tillage, cumulative
   CO2 loss from the deepest tillage treatment (switch plow; 300 mm deep)
   was as much as 33 times greater than that from the no-till (control)
   treatment. Cumulative CO2 loss following intermediate tillage (disk
   harrow; 78-145 mm deep) was as much as 2.3-fold greater than the no-till
   treatment, but shallower tillage (tine cultivation; 20-41 mm deep) was
   generally not different. Short-term tillage-induced CO2 loss was
   primarily related to soil moisture content and soil porosity. Soil
   respiration measurements made with the two chamber techniques agreed
   well with each other except for the deepest tillage treatment, where the
   larger chamber measured CO2 flux that was approximately 10 times greater
   than for the smaller chamber. Results indicate that minimum or
   no-tillage may reduce short-term tillage-induced CO2 emissions on
   organic soils, thus minimizing soil subsidence. (c) 2006 Published by

Abstract = {{Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate plant available water were
   developed from a database of arable soils in Sweden. The PTFs were
   developed to fulfil the minimum requirements of any agro-hydrological
   application, i.e., soil water content at wilting point (theta(wp)) and
   field capacity (theta(fc)),from information that frequently is available
   from soil surveys such as texture and soil organic carbon content (SOC).
   From the same variables we also estimated bulk density (rho) and
   porosity (epsilon), which seldom are included in surveys, but are needed
   for calculating element mass balances. The seven particle-size classes
   given in the data set were aggregated in different ways to match
   information commonly gained from surveys. Analysis of covariance and
   stepwise multiple linear regression were used for quantifying the
   influence of depth, particle size class, textural class and soil organic
   carbon on the characteristic variables. PTFs developed from other data
   sets were also tested and their goodness-of-fit and bias was evaluated.
   These functions and those developed for the Swedish database were also
   tested on an independent data set and finally ranked according to their
   goodness of fit. Among single independent variables, clay was the best
   predictor for theta(wp), sand ( or the sum of clay and silt) for
   theta(fc) and SOC for rho and epsilon. A large fraction of the variation
   in theta(wp) and theta(fc) is explained by soil texture and SOC ( up to
   90\%) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) were as small as 0.03 m(3)
   water m(-3) soil in the best models. For the prediction of rho and
   epsilon in the test data set, the best PTF could only explain 40-43\% of
   the total variance with corresponding RMSEs of 0.14 g cm(-3) and 5.3\%
   by volume, respectively. Recently presented PTFs derived from a North
   American database performed very well for estimating theta(wp) ( low
   error and bias) and could be recommended for Swedish soils if
   measurements of clay, sand and SOC were available. Although somewhat
   less accurately, also theta(fc) could be estimated satisfactorily. This
   indicates that the determination of plant available water by texture and
   SOC is rather independent of soil genesis and that certain PTFs are
   transferable between continents.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable agricultural use of cultivated desert soils has become a
   concern in Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, because loss of
   topsoil in dust storms has been recently intensified. We chose four
   desert sites to investigate the effects of cultivation (cropping) on (i)
   soil organic C and its size fractions and (ii) soil aggregate stability
   (as a measure of soil erodibility). These parameters are of vital
   importance for evaluating the sustainability of agricultural practices.
   Total organic C as well as organic C fractions in soil (coarse organic
   C, 0.1-2 mm; young organic C, 0.05-0.1 mm; stable organic C, < 0.05 mm)
   generally increased with the duration of the cultivation period from 0
   (virgin soil, non-cultivated) to more than 30 years (p < 0.05). Compared
   to total organic C in virgin soils (2.3-3.5 g kg(-1) soil),
   significantly greater values were found after 10 to > 20 years of
   cultivation (6.2-7.1 g kg(-1) soil). The increase in organic C in desert
   soils following prolonged cultivation was mainly the consequence of an
   increase in the coarse organic C. The increase in total organic C in
   soil was also dependent on clay content {[}total organic C = 0.96 +
   0.249 clay content (\%) + 0.05 cultivation year, R(2) = 0.48, n = 27, p,
   < 0.001]. This indicates that clay protected soil organic C from
   mineralization, and also contributed to the increase in soil organic C
   as time of cultivation increased.
   There was a significant positive correlation between aggregate stability
   and total organic C across all field sites. The water stability of
   aggregates was low (with water-stable aggregate percentage similar to
   4\% of dry-sieved aggregates of size 1-5 mm). There was no consistent
   pattern of increase in the soil aggregate stability with time of
   cultivation at different locations, suggesting that desert soils might
   remain prone to wind erosion even after 50 years of cultivation.
   Alternative management options, such as retaining harvested crop
   residues on soil surface and excluding or minimizing tillage, may permit
   sustainable agricultural use of desert soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Soil aggregation plays a crucial role in soil physicochemical and
   biological processes, thus influencing soil nutrient retention. It is
   possible to improve soil aggregation by choosing appropriate
   agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effects of tillage, crops and fertilizer sources on size distribution of
   water-stable aggregates (WSA) and nutrient concentrations in aggregate
   fractions. Soil samples were collected from field sites involving
   sixteen factorial combinations of tillage {[}conventional tillage (CT)
   or no-till (NT)], crop rotations {[}continuous maize (CC) or
   soybean/maize (SC)] and fertilizer sources (0, 15, 30 and 45 Mg wet
   weight ha(-1) of composted cattle manure balanced with inorganic
   fertilizers). Aggregate fractionation was performed using a wet-sieving
   method. Four years after the treatments were established, the proportion
   of large WSA (WSA(> 2mm)) was greater in the NT system, suggesting that
   NT increased soil aggregation compared to the CT system. There was no
   difference in soil aggregation between continuous maize and
   soybean/maize rotations. The application of 30 and 45 Mg ha(-1) year 1
   of composted manure produced more WSA(> 2mm) than inorganic fertilizers.
   The WSA(> 2mm) had a higher total C concentration in CT than NT soils,
   indicating that WSA(> 2mm) formed in CT systems contained more soil
   organic matter (SOM) than those in NT systems. However, the difference
   disappeared when the data were expressed on a sand-free aggregate basis,
   indicating a dilution effect due to more sand in WSA(> 2mm) from the NT
   system than the CT system. Total C, N and P concentrations were at least
   3 times higher in water-stable microaggregates (WSA(0.25-0.053mm)) than
   water-stable macroaggregates (WSA(> 0.25mm)). The WSA(0.25-0.053mm)
   fraction is considered to be a sink for these nutrients, but may also be
   susceptible to erosion. Transport processes that preferentially remove
   the WSA(0.25-0.053mm) fraction from agroecosystems could lead to
   nutrient loading in adjacent ecosystems. It was concluded that adopting
   no-tillage and applying composted manure increased soil aggregation and
   nutrient retention in a sandy-loam soil under maize production. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Pulp and paper mill sludges are produced from primary and secondary
   treatment of wastes derived from virgin wood fiber sources, recycled
   paper products, and non-wood fibers. Sludges and sludge composts may be
   utilized in agriculture to increase soil organic matter, improve soil
   physical properties, provide nutrients, and increase soil pH. Positive
   effects of primary, deinking, and low-nutrient combined sludges on soil
   quality are primarily due to increased soil organic matter, aggregation,
   water holding capacity, infiltration rate, and cation exchange capacity.
   Nitrogen and P immobilization are often induced by primary and deinking
   sludges, but can be overcome by delayed planting, adding N and P,
   planting of legumes, or composting. Improved crop production obtained
   with secondary treatment sludges is most often attributable to enhanced
   nutrient availability, particularly N, but improved soil physical
   properties are implicated in some studies. Pulp and paper mill sludges
   and sludge composts are useful soil amendments and plant nutrient

Abstract = {{Soil enzyme activities are useful indicators of soil quality as they are
   very sensitive to disturbance. Sample storage or pre-treatments could
   affect the results in these assays, which are normally determined in
   fresh samples, kept cold or frozen. The objectives of this study were to
   (i) evaluate the effect of air-drying or air-drying and rewetting on
   beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and urease activities in soils from
   different locations, degradation status and sampling seasons, and (ii)
   assess if air-drying or air-drying and rewetting is an accurate sample
   storage and pre-treatment procedure for enzyme activities in soil
   quality evaluations under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. Our results
   showed that urease, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities were
   hardly affected by air-drying of degraded and non-degraded soils from
   the two locations studied in all seasons. Short incubations (4, 8 and
   12d at 23 degrees C) of rewetted air-dried soil at 55\% of water-holding
   capacity showed different patterns depending on the enzyme studied.
   Urease and beta-glucosidase activities were relatively stable during
   incubation, with several significant (P < 0.05) shifts up and down in
   some soils and samplings. However, acid phosphatase showed an increase
   in activity with incubation, of between 5\% and 50\% relative to
   air-dried samples. These increases followed no pattern and were
   unrelated to soil characteristics or sampling date. Hence, urease,
   phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities determined in air-dried soil
   samples seem to be representative of those obtained under field-moist
   conditions. In contrast, short incubations of rewetted soil samples can
   produce fluctuations in these enzyme activities, mainly of acid
   phosphatase, and estimations in these conditions are not so
   representative of field-moist soil values. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for the long-term
   productivity of agroecosystems. An investigation was conducted to study
   the effects of long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and
   farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate
   distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment
   started in 1982 in an and region of northwest China. Application of
   inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase
   SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and
   SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18\% on average,
   compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment.
   Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially,
   resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium
   nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application
   of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and
   nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop
   residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or
   combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK
   treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations
   from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg(-1), respectively, to 15.46
   and 1.28 g kg(-1), on average, and also enhanced available nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium concentrations by 47, 50, and 68\%,
   respectively, during the 23-year period. Treatment with FYM resulted in
   a 0.48 mm greater average mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and a
   higher percentage of macro-aggregates (> 2 mm) and small
   macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD
   increased with increasing SOC concentration (R-2=0.75). The SOC
   concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in
   macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm).
   Approximately 54-60\% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates
   (0.25-0.05 mm) and sand+silt fractions (< 0.05 mm) after treatment
   without FYM but 57-64\% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates (>
   0.25 mm) after treatment with FYM. MNPK treatment had the greatest
   effect on improving the levels of SOC and NPK nutrients and in enhancing
   the formation and stability of macro-aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Soil wettability is especially important for rainfed agriculture in
   climates with a dry period during the growing season. The effect of
   aggregate structure and soil organic C content on wettability of soil
   aggregates was determined for grassland (grass) and tilled fields
   (tillage). Soil organic C, plastic limit, aggregate total porosity, and
   wettability at 100 mm (rapid wetting) and 300 mm (slow wetting) water
   tension were measured on soil at 0-0.2 in depth. Natural aggregates from
   tillage and grass were compared to soil pellets formed by remolding
   aggregates. At both tensions, wettability of grass aggregates was
   significantly greater than that of tillage aggregates (P < 0.001).
   Pellets were significantly less wettable than natural aggregates at 300
   mm tension and during the initial wetting at 100 mm tension, but became
   significantly more wettable with time at 100 mm tension. Cumulative
   water uptake during 60 min exceeded the initial total porosity of
   pellets and natural tillage aggregates, suggesting incipient failure
   (formation of microcracks) during fast wetting. Grass aggregates
   contained twice as much organic C as tillage aggregates (26 g kg(-1)
   versus 13 g kg(-1)). Organic C was linearly and positively related to
   plastic limit, total porosity, and the wettability of natural aggregates
   at 300 mm tension. At 100 min tension, organic C was negatively related
   to wettability of natural aggregates under grass, but unrelated to
   wettability under tillage. Aggregate wettability was positively related
   to organic carbon content, except when the arrangement of soil
   constituents reduced or prevented incipient failure and soil dispersion
   during rapid wetting resulted in cumulative water uptake (60 min)
   similar to initial aggregate total porosity. Organic C increased
   wettability of grass aggregates when compared to tillage aggregates and
   also stabilized natural aggregates during fast wetting (100 mm tension).
   Both soil organic C content and aggregate structure were key factors
   controlling aggregate stability and wettability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Traditional models of soil organic matter decomposition predict that
   soil carbon pools with high chemical stability and large physical
   structure are more resistant against degradation than chemically labile
   and fine-grained material. We investigated whether soil fauna, by its
   direct and indirect effects on carbon turnover, would reinforce or
   counteract this general trend.
   The effects of four major faunal groups on carbon pools of differing
   recalcitrance were studied in an extensive microcosm experiment.
   Ninty-six microcosms were inoculated with nematodes, enchytraeids,
   collembola, and lumbricids in three densities, including combinations of
   groups. Bare agricultural soil and soil covered with maize litter were
   used as substrates. The microcosms were kept under constant conditions
   at 12 degrees C and 50\% water holding capacity for 60 days. At the end
   of the experiment, soil particles were separated into size classes (< 63
   mu m, 63-250 mu m, > 250 mu m) and carbon pools were separated into
   solubility fractions (K2SO4-SO4-soluble, pyrophosphate-soluble,
   insoluble), by means of ultrasonic dispersion and subsequent stepwise
   solubilisation.
   Both in bare soil and in soil with litter, the carbon pools with the
   highest chemical stability (insoluble) and the larger particle sizes (>
   63 mu m) were degraded more intensively than all other pools in the
   presence of lumbricids. The pools of intermediate chemical stability
   (pyrophosphate-soluble) underwent simultaneous degradation and
   neoformation brought about by different animal groups. The chemically
   most labile pool (K2SO4-soluble) remained largely unaffected by the
   fauna. Fixation of carbon in microbial biomass was increased by
   nematodes in bare soil and by enchytraeids in soil with litter. The
   results illustrate in detail how, under the influence of soil fauna,
   soil carbon pools are decomposed in a cascade-like process where carbon
   is transferred from the stable to the more labile pools, while
   simultaneously a proportion is fixed in microbial biomass and another
   part is lost as CO2. Thereby, the relationship between a substrate's
   persistence and its chemical stability and physical size is
   substantially modified. We summarize the mechanisms that most likely are
   responsible for the different effects of the investigated faunal groups.

   4-88\%) and organic matter content (0.97 - 2.70\% org. C), (ii) fairly
   diverse soil-water retention curves, and (iii) differing pH values. We
   quantified the effect of soil moisture on mineralization of pesticides
   and found that (i) at soil water potential e - 20 MPa minimal pesticide
   mineralization occurred; (ii) a linear correlation (P < 0.0001) exists
   between increasing soil moisture ( within a soil water potential range

   mineralization; (iii) optimum pesticide mineralization was obtained at a

Abstract = {{There is a lack of understanding of how associations among soil

   investigation to quantify relationships between GHG emissions and soil
   indicators in an irrigated agricultural field under standard tillage
   (ST) and a field recently converted (2yr) to no-tillage (NT). Soil cores
   (15-cm depth) were incubated at 25 degrees C at field moisture content
   and 75\% water holding capacity. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   identified that most of the variation of the measured soil properties
   was related to differences in soil C and N and soil water conditions
   under ST, but soil texture and bulk density under NT. This trend became
   more apparent after irrigation. However, principal component regression
   (PCR) suggested that soil physical properties or total C and N were less
   important in controlling GHG emissions across tillage systems. The CO2
   flux was more strongly determined by microbial biomass under ST and
   inorganic N content under NT than soil physical properties. Similarly,
   N2O and CH4 fluxes were predominantly controlled by NO3- content and
   labile C and N availability in both ST and NT soils at field moisture
   content, and NH4+ content after irrigation. Our study indicates that the
   field-scale variability of GHG emissions is controlled primarily by
   biochemical parameters rather than physical parameters. Differences in
   the availability and type of C and N sources for microbial activity as
   affected by tillage and irrigation develop different levels and

Abstract = {{Agricultural systems produce both detrimental and beneficial effects on
   soil quality (SQ). We compared soil physical properties of long-term
   conventional (CON) and alternative (ALT) cropping systems near Akron,
   Colorado (CO); Brookings, South Dakota (SD); Bushland, Texas (TX);
   Fargo, North Dakota (ND); Mandan (ND); Mead, Nebraska (NE); Sidney,
   Montana (MT); and Swift Current, Saskatchewan (SK), Canada. Objectives
   were to quantify the changes in soil physical attributes in cropping
   systems and assess the potential of individual soil attributes as
   sensitive indicators of change in SQ. Soil samples were collected three
   times per year from each treatment at each site for one rotation cycle
   (4 years at Brookings and Mead). Water infiltration rates were measured.
   Soil bulk density (BD) and gravimetric water were measured at 0-7.5,
   7.5-15, and 15-30 cm depth increments and water-filled pore space ratio
   (WFPS) was calculated. At six locations, a rotary sieve was used to
   separate soil (top 5 cm) into six aggregate size groups and calculate
   mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregates. Under the CON system at
   Brookings, dry aggregates (> 19 mm) abraded into the smallest size class
   (< 0.4 mm) on sieving. In contrast, the large aggregates from the ALT
   system abraded into size classes between 2 and 6mm. Dry aggregate size
   distribution (DASD) shows promise as an indicator of SQ related to
   susceptibility of soil to wind erosion. Aggregates from CON were least
   stable in water. Soil C was greater under ALT than CON for both
   Brookings and Mead. At other locations, MWD of aggregates under
   continuous crop or no tillage (ALT systems) was greater than MWD under
   CON. There was no crop system effect on water infiltration rates for
   locations having the same tillage within cropping system. Tillage
   resulted in increased, decreased, or unchanged near-surface BD. Because
   there was significant temporal variation in water infiltration, MWD, and

Abstract = {{Both soil conservation and crop productivity may negatively be affected
   by changes caused to soil characteristics by management techniques. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of soil tillage on
   soil physical attributes and organic carbon contents. The experiment was
   carried out over a period of 17 years in Eldorado do Sul County (RS) in
   a loamy Acrisol under different management systems: conventional
   tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage, using vetch-maize in crop
   succession. An area of native grassland adjacent to the agricultural
   plots was used as a control. The soil samples were collected in
   September before sowing the summer crop, from 0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-12.5
   and 12.5-17.5 cm deep soil layers. The evaluated soil propeties were
   organic carbon contents, bulk and particle densities, macro, micro and
   total porosity, flocculation degree, and aggregate stability. The soil
   management systems had no effect on soil density and total porosity, but
   the pore size distribution was dependent on the sampling depth. Soil
   macroporosity in conventional tillage as compared to reduced tillage and
   no-tillage was only higher in the layer of 7.5 to 12.5 cm, and
   micropores were more abundant at a soil depth of 0 to 2.5 cm in no
   tillage in relation to other tillage systems. The use of no-tillage
   systems increased aggregate stability in the surface layer (0-2.5 cm)
   compared to conventional tillage and was related to the increase in soil
   organic carbon contents.}},

Abstract = {{Excretal returns and physical disturbance due to treading can greatly
   influence nitrogen flows in grazed pastures. Dung and urine depositions
   stimulate microbial transformations, while soil compaction and poaching
   change the physical environment in which these transformations take
   place. In this study, a cattle overwintering area in the Southwest Czech
   Republic was characterized with respect to bulk density, porosity,
   water-filled pore space (WFPS), organic C, total N, pH, microbial
   biomass C and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA). Carbon dioxide and
   nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions were measured on four different dates
   between October 2001 and May 2002. Sampling took place along a transect
   away from an open barn with access to feed. Soil chemical and biological
   properties showed that deposition of excreta declined with distance from
   the barn. In contrast, N(2)O emissions were highest at intermediate
   positions along the transect. At the section with the greatest animal
   impact, the ratio of N(2) versus N(2)O produced was five-fold higher,
   and the soil pH was 2 units higher, compared to the section with the
   least animal impact, which indicated that soil conditions favoured
   production of N(2) rather than N(2)O in the area where excretal returns
   and treading was intense. A multiple linear regression was conducted
   using data from the last sampling. There were significant effects of
   WFPS and pH on log-transformed N(2)O emissions, while effects of
   NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-), and interactions between NH(4)(+) and,
   respectively, WFPS and pH were nearly significant. The observations
   indicate that, whereas pasture management to achieve a better
   distribution of animal impact may improve N retention in the soil, it is
   not clear whether this will reduce N20 emissions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The original light-brown sandy seam filling of pavements in urban areas
   turns dark and changes its properties by the time due to various inputs
   of urban dust. Deposited C-org inputs do mostly not have natural
   characteristics but are man-made, e.g., diesel dust. Thus, properties of
   the seam material are not predictable from experiences with forest or
   agricultural soils. Semiperviously sealed urban areas are sites of
   contaminant deposition as well as groundwater recharge. For an
   assessment of the resulting groundwater-contamination risk in these
   areas, the properties of the seam material, which influences transport
   processes, must be known. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   pore-system build-up, which includes size distribution and fractal
   character in the seam material of urban sites. The investigated samples
   were taken from pavements adjacent to roads in Berlin and Warsaw.
   The micropore parameters (nanometer range) were characterized using
   water-vapor desorption isotherms, mesopore parameters (micrometer range)
   were estimated from mercury-intrusion porosimetry and macropore
   parameters (millimeter range) from water-retention curves. Particle
   density, dry bulk density, and particle-size distribution were measured
   using standard methods. Volumes of micro- and mesopores as well as
   particle densities and dry bulk densities correlated with C-tot
   contents. However, no such relation was found for macropore volumes.
   Compared to the original sandy seam filling, the altered seam material
   shows significantly higher C-org contents and higher amounts of micro-
   and mesopores. Therefore, the available water capacity increases by
   0.05-0.11 m(3) m(-3), as compared to the original sandy seam filling.
   Compared to natural sandy soils having similar C-org contents, the seam
   material shows similar macropore volumes, but the volume of mesopores
   and micropores is a few times smaller. That is mainly because of the
   particulate character of the organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{Besides supplying calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) to plants, gypsum has
   recently been used in agriculture to ameliorate some soil physical and
   chemical properties, especially to alleviate aluminum phytotoxicity in
   subsoils. When applied in large quantities, however, gypsum may leach
   significant amounts of nutrients from the plow layer. This study was
   conducted to assess the effect of gypsum addition to the soil on the
   magnitude of cation leaching as well as the relationship of leaching
   with some soil properties in a group of seven Brazilian soils. Rates of
   gypsum equivalents to 0, 5.0, 10, and 20 t ha(-1) (0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 g
   kg(-1) ) were mixed with triplicate soil samples consisting of 3.0 kg of
   dry base soil. After 60 days of incubation at room temperature (15-25
   degrees C), the experimental units were packed into polyvinyl chloride
   leaching columns (32-cm-highx10 -cm-diameter) at a density of 0.9 g cm
   -3 . Thereafter, they were percolated once a week with a volume of
   distilled water equivalent to 1.5 times the total soil porosity over 11
   weeks. Soil samples were collected before the first and after the last
   percolation, for chemical analysis. Averaged across soils, 11
   percolation events leached about 26\% of each Ca, magnesium (Mg), and
   potassium (K) from the treatment without gypsum. Averaged across soils
   and rates, addition of gypsum leached 41-94\% of added Ca, 13-90\% of
   exchangeable Mg, and 13-58\% of exchangeable K, and the highest losses
   occurred on the sandiest soils. The relationship between soil parameters
   and Ca leaching varied with gypsum rate: in the treatments that received
   gypsum, leaching was negatively related to cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), clay, and organic matter, and positively correlated with sand; in
   the treatment with no gypsum, leaching correlated with the same
   parameters above, nevertheless, all coefficients presented opposite
   signs. Leaching of K caused by gypsum was negatively associated with
   clay and positively with sand, whereas leaching of Mg was poorly
   correlated with any soil parameter. Gypsum is a good source to promote
   high and fast downward movement of Ca in the soil profile, but rates
   must be cautiously chosen because of excessive leaching of Mg especially
   on soils with low CEC.}},

Abstract = {{Clay and organic matter both have cementing and binding abilities that
   play crucial roles in the formation and stability of soil aggregates.
   The interactions of clay and organic matter on the extent of
   differential swelling and the volume of entrapped air in soil aggregates
   during fast wetting both in the presence and in the absence of rainfall
   were investigated. The influence of clay mineralogy was also examined.
   The parameters assessed in the study were water-stable aggregates (WSA),
   final infiltration rate (FIR), runoff (Q), and soil loss (E). Samples
   from the surface (0-10 cm) of six agricultural soils in Trinidad with
   three levels of clay (low, <20\%; medium, 20-45\%; and high, >45\%) and
   two of organic matter (low, <= 3\% and high, >3\%) were used. Generally,
   aggregate stability and infiltration rate increased while seal
   formation, runoff, and soil loss decreased with increasing clay content.
   The high clay, high organic matter sample dominated by high activity
   clay yielded the highest WSA (68.8\%) and the smallest E (0.99 kg
   m(-2)), whilst the low clay, low organic matter sample dominated by low
   activity clay minerals had the lowest WSA value (5.3\%). The high cation
   exchange capacity (20.2 cmol kg(-1)) of Oropuna, a high clay, low
   organic matter content soil, classified as kaolinitic, indicates the
   presence of appreciable quantities of smectites. Therefore, the
   significantly lower WSA (56.5\%) and FIR (3.2 min h(-1)) and higher Q
   (100.6 mm) and E (5.59 kg m(-2)) of Oropuna over Montserrat (WSA =

   kg m(-2)) medium and high clay smectitic soils high in organic matter
   demonstrates the importance of organic matter in alleviating clay
   dispersion and slaking in soils predominated by high activity expanding
   clays. The results also demonstrate that there is a threshold clay
   content above which the support of organic matter is required to weaken
   disruptive forces and below which organic matter and slow wetting are
   not effective in diminishing disruptive forces.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of saturated and unsaturated water flow in soil are important

   quasi-steady infiltration measurements made using 20-, 30-,

   diverse agricultural management practices. Mean infiltration rate
   increased from 50, to 81, to 95 mm h(-1) as diameter increased. Standard
   deviation and range also increased with diameter. All three diameters
   produced lognormal data distributions. These results indicate that
   increasing the sample area is not equivalent to pooling of many smaller
   samples, which would have produced the same mean but with a lower
   variance. Follow-up experiments with a double-ring configuration or a
   divider placed in the center of a 45-cm cylinder demonstrated that
   adding vertical barriers reduced infiltration even when the total
   infiltration area was unchanged. A pulse of dye introduced 10 min before
   removing the ponded water showed an extensive network of dyed flow
   pathways in all but the slowest infiltration situations. The pathways
   were not associated with visible macropores. Careful consideration
   should be given to the dimensions of samples used to estimate saturated

Abstract = {{Native North American prairie grasslands are renowned for the richness
   of their soils, having excellent soil structure and very high organic
   content and microbial biomass. In this study, surface soils from three
   prairie restorations of varying ages and plant community compositions
   were compared with a nearby undisturbed native prairie remnant and a
   cropped agricultural field in terms of soil physical, chemical and
   microbial properties. Soil moisture, organic matter, total carbon, total
   nitrogen, total sulfur, C:N, water-holding capacity and microbial
   biomass (total PLFA) were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the virgin
   prairie remnant as well as the two long-term (21 and 24 year) prairie
   restorations, compared with the agricultural field and the restoration
   that was begun more recently (7 years prior to sampling). Soil bulk
   density was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the agricultural and
   recently restored sites. In most cases, the soil quality indicators and
   microbial community structures in the restoration sites were
   intermediate between those of the virgin prairie and the agricultural
   sites. Levels of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PLFA indicators of
   nutritional stress were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the
   agricultural and recent restoration sites than in the long-term
   restorations or the native prairie. Samples could be assigned to the
   correct site by discriminant analysis of the PLFA data, with the
   exception that the two long-term restoration sites overlapped.
   Redundancy analysis showed that prairie age (p < 0.005) was the most
   important environmental factor in determining the PLFA microbial
   community composition, with C:N (p < 0.015) also being significant.
   These findings demonstrate that prairie restorations can lead to
   improved quality of surface soils. We predict that the conversion of
   farmland into prairie will shift the soil quality, microbial community
   biomass and microbial community composition in the direction of native
   prairies, but with the restoration methods tested it may take many
   decades to approach the levels found in a virgin prairie throughout the

Abstract = {{Compost amendment of soils degraded by urban development is seen as a

   high-value market for locally produced compost. This review evaluates
   literature on organic soil amendments used in agriculture and

   landscapes. Research on agricultural use of organic amendments
   consistently shows soil bulk density and penetration resistance
   decreasing with increasing amendment rate, and aggregate stability,
   porosity, and infiltration rate increasing with amendment rate. The
   effect of organic amendments on plant available water is less clear.
   Although organic amendments increase soil water holding capacity, much
   of the increase may not be available to plants. The nutrient benefits of
   compost amendments are often overlooked. Composts with a ON ratio of
   20:1 or less can provide significant amounts of nitrogen and other
   nutrients, improving the establishment of turf and landscape plants, and
   reducing the amount of supplemental nutrients needed. Materials with a
   high ON ratio immobilize N, which can retard plant establishment.
   Results suggest that compost amendment rates of about one-third. by

   fractions in the maize soil on the basis of the delta(13)C values. Total
   SOC stocks down to a depth of 60 cm and including the humus layer were
   larger at the spruce site (10.3 kg C m(-2)) as compared with the
   grassland, wheat and maize (7 to 8 C kg m(-2)). However, SOC stocks in
   the mineral soil were smaller in the forest soil than in the
   agricultural soils. In the arable soils, the aggregate fractions 53-250
   pm and 250-1000 pm were the most abundant size fractions, whereas
   aggregates > 1000 mu m were most abundant in the grassland and forest
   soil. The SOC concentration and the C/N ratio were greater for
   macroaggregates (> 250 pm) than microaggregates (< 250 mu m) in the
   field and grassland soils. At the maize site the percentage of
   maize-derived C was smallest in the fraction < 53 mu m with 24\% and
   steadily increased with increasing aggregate size to 47\% in the
   fraction > 1000 pm.
   The major part (86-91\%) of the SOC was associated with the heavy
   mineral fraction at the grassland, maize and wheat site. In the A
   horizon of the spruce stand, the particulate organic matter accounted
   for 52\% of the total SOC content. The C/N ratios of density fractions
   decreased in the order free POM< 1.6> occluded POM > Mineral-SOM for all
   soils and depths.
   The mean age of organic carbon in the water-stable aggregates in the Ap
   horizon of the maize site increased with decreasing aggregate size from
   35 yr (> 1000 mu m) to 86 yr (< 53 mu m). For the density fractions the
   order was free POM (22 yr)< dense occluded POM1.6-2.0(49 yr)<
   Mineral-SOM (63 yr)< light occluded POW< 1.6 (83 yr). The results showed
   that the type of land use affected the distribution pattern of litter
   carbon to functionally different SOM pools and that increasing SOC
   concentrations were closely associated with the formation of
   macroaggregates. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest and grassland soils in highlands of southern Mediterranean Turkey
   are being seriously degraded and destructed due to extensive
   agricultural activities. This study investigated the effects of changes
   in land-use type on some soil properties in a Mediterranean plateau.
   Three adjacent land-use types included the cultivated lands, which have
   been converted from pastures for 12 years, fragmented forests, and
   unaltered pastures lands. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were
   collected from four sites at each of the three different land-use types
   from depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm in Typic Haploxeroll soils with an
   elevation of about 1400 m. When the pasture was converted into
   cultivation, soil organic matter (SOM) pool of cultivated lands for a
   depth of 0-20 cm were significantly reduced by, on average 49\% relative
   to SOM content of the pasture lands. There was no significant difference
   in SOM between the depths in each land-use type, and SOM values of the
   forest and pasture lands were almost similar. There was also a
   significant change in soil bulk density (BD) among cultivation (1.33 Mg
   m(-3)), pasture (1.19 Mg m(-3)), and forest (1.25 Mg m(-3)) soils at
   depth of 0-20 cm. Only for the pasture, BD of the depth of 0-10 cm was
   significantly different from that of 10-20 cm. Depending upon the
   increases in BD and disruption of pores by cultivation, total porosity
   decreased accordingly. Cultivation of the unaltered pasture obviously
   increased the soil erodibility measured by USLE-K factor for each soil
   depth, and USLE-K factor was approximately two times greater in the
   cultivated land than in the pasture indicating the vulnerability of the
   cultivated land to water erosion. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and
   water-stable aggregation (WSA) were greater in the pasture and forest
   soils compared to the cultivated soils, and didn't change with the depth
   for each land-use type. Aggregates of >4.0 mm size were dominant in the
   pasture and forest soils, whereas the cultivated soils comprised
   aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. I found that samples collected from
   cultivated land gave the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity values
   regardless of soil depths, whereas the highest values were measured on
   samples from forest soils. In conclusion, the results showed that the
   cultivation of the pastures degraded the soil physical properties,
   leaving soils more susceptible to the erosion. This suggests that land
   disturbances should be strictly avoided in the pastures with the limited
   soil depth in the southern Mediterranean highlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier

   compaction on soil C mineralization in a claypan soil amended with
   poultry litter (i.e. turkey excrement mixed with pine shavings as
   bedding). In a laboratory study, a Mexico silt loam soil was compacted
   to four bulk density levels (1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 Mg m(-3)) with and
   without poultry litter and incubated at 25 C for 42 days. A field
   experiment with plots that were maintained fallow was also conducted in
   2001 and 2002 on the same claypan soil in North Central Missouri. Soil
   was amended with litter (0 and 19 Mg ha(-1)) and left uncompacted or
   uniformly compacted. Results showed that soil CO2 efflux was decreased
   by compaction up to 72\% in the laboratory study and 46\% in the field
   study of 2002 (P < 0.05). Litter application enhanced soil CO2 efflux (P
   < 0.05) due to the addition of readily available C from litter. In the
   laboratory study, soil CO2 efflux was negatively correlated with soil
   bulk density and the proportion of micropores (P < 0.05). Conversely,
   soil CO2 efflux was positively related with total porosity and the
   proportion of macropores (P < 0.05). In the field, surface soil
   compaction caused changes in soil water content and soil aeration, which
   may have had the greatest effect on variation in soil CO2 efflux. These
   results indicate that both soil compaction and litter application change
   the rate of soil C mineralization, and the magnitude of those changes is
   modified by climatic variation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The agriculture use causes alterations on the soil physical attributes.
   That a alterations usually indices a deterioration of its quality, due
   to removal of the canopy and excessive use of the mechanization. This
   work aimed to evaluate the alterations of soil physical properties as
   indicators of soil quality of a typic Acric Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol),
   under different management systems, compared to the native vegetation.
   Soil samples were collected at the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30-cm depths in
   the region of Campos das Vertentes, at the Alto do Rio Grande, MG. The
   evaluated attributes were: aggregate stability in water, expressed for
   the geometric mean diameter, bulk density, and porosity. The following
   management systems were evaluated: conventional tillage with potato
   (CTP); conventional tillage with potato, followed by oat in rotation
   with corn (CTPOC); conventional tillage with corn (CTC); no-till with
   corn (NTC); eucalyptus forest (EF); and native vegetation (NV). The bulk
   density increased in the systems CTPOC and NTC, compared to the native
   vegetation. The total volume of pores was reduced in the systems CTP,
   CTPOC, and NTC, even within the short growing time of the systems CTP
   and CTPOC. The conventional systems CTP, CTPOC and CTC did not change
   the soil aggregate stabilty enough to differ of the native vegetation.
   The systems with less canopy removal are establishing a new equilibrium
   condition. The slighter soil tillage, the higher organic matter content,
   and the grass root aggregating action in the systems NTC and EF were
   benefic for the soil quality. The penetration resistance was reduced in
   the superficial layers in the conventional systems, CTP, CTPOC, and CTC,
   due to the soil till. There were no significant differences in
   permeability of soil to water among the management systems (CTP, CTPOC,
   CTC and NTC), with the values ranging from 35,4 to 54,6 mmh(-1) being
   classified as slow to moderate; these values were rather inferior than
   the equilibrium system (NV).}},

   exposed to uni-dimensional compression with pressures varying from 32 to
   1.000 kPa. The highest compressibility of the aggregates for horizon A

   -1 kPa and -1.000 kPa (soil moistures of 0.32 and 0.30 kg kg(-1)

   moisture approximates 0.38 kg kg(-1). The largest reduction in aggregate
   volume occurred under a mechanical pressure below 400 kPa. This
   indicates that these soils are quite prone to compaction, specially the

Abstract = {{Wetting and drying (W-D) cycles can cause strong modifications of the
   structure of a soil, especially in pore distribution. which reflects the
   temporal and spatial distribution of soil water and, consequently, these
   processes can affect soil water and nutrient retention and movement.
   These alterations have important practical consequences when calculating
   soil water storages and matric potentials, widely used in irrigation
   management. The present paper has as objective to use gamma ray computed
   tomography (GCT) as a tool to investigate possible modifications in soil
   structure induced by W-D cycles and to analyze how these alterations can
   affect soil water retention. The GCT scanner used was a first generation
   system with a fixed source-detector arrangement, with a radioactive
   gamma ray source of Am-241. Soil samples were taken from profiles of
   three different soils characterized as Xanthic Ferralsol (Fx), Eutric
   Nitosol (Ne) and Rhodic Ferralsol (Fr). Eighteen samples (50 cm 3), six
   from each soil, were submitted to none (To), three (T-1) and nine (T,)
   wetting/drying cycles. Based on image analysis it was possible to detect
   modifications in soil structure in all samples after wetting/drying
   cycles for all treatments. Tomographic unit profiles of the samples
   permitted to identify an increase on soil porosity with the increase in
   the number of wetting/drying cycles and it was also possible to quantify
   the average porosity values. The statistical test (Duncan test)
   indicates that there are significant differences between treatments for

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of no-till (NT) farming in reducing loss of soil
   organic matter (SOM) depends on climate and soil properties. Soil
   samples were obtained from two long-term experiments that were designed
   to study the impact of tillage systems on crop yields. However, the
   objectives of this experiment were to assess the impact of NT on soil
   organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate and other soil properties and to
   estimate historic depletion of SOC under different soil management
   practices with reference to the undisturbed wooded control. The two
   long-term experiments in Ohio studied were those sited at South
   Charleston and Hoytville. The South Charleston, (83 degrees 30' W and 39
   degrees 48' N) experiment was established in 1962 on Crosby silt loam
   (fine mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf). The site has long-term annual
   temperature and precipitation of 10.8 degrees C and 1043 mm,
   respectively. Tillage treatments for continuous corn (Zea mays) were NT,
   chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow (MP). The Hoytville (84 degrees 04'
   W and 41 degrees 03' N) experiment was established in 1987 on Hoytville
   clay loam (fine, illitic mesic Mollic Epiaqualfs) soil. The site has
   long-term annual temperature and precipitation of 9.9 degrees C and 845
   rum, respectively. There were two crop rotations: (i) 2-year
   corn-soybean (Glycine max) rotation with NT and subsoiling and (ii)
   3-year com-soybean-oat (Avena sativa) rotation with NT, CP, and
   rotational tillage soil management. The Hoytville clay site is poorly
   drained, has higher clay content, and higher and more even by
   distributed antecedent level of SOC in the soil profile than does the
   South Charleston silt loam soil. No-till increased SOC and N pools in
   the 0 to 5-cm layer in silt loam soil but had no effect in clay soil.
   The rate of SOC sequestration in the silt-loam soil under NT was 175 kg
   C ha(-1) y(-1). The silt loam soil had higher SOC and N stratification
   ratios in NT than in MP and CP treatments, whereas the stratification
   ratios were low and similar in all treatments in the clayey soil. For
   both soils, there were no differences between tillage treatments in
   several soil properties including texture, available water capacity,
   hydraulic conductivity (K), and cation exchange capacity. The NT
   decreased soil bulk density and pH in the 0 to 15-cm layer in the silt
   loam soil. The plow till treatments had a small impact on soil
   aggregation in clayey soil. The decline in water-stable aggregates with
   reference to NT was no more than one sixth. In the silt loam soil,
   however, the water-stable aggregates in plow till treatments were merely
   one third of that in the NT treatment. The historic loss of the SOC pool
   for 0 to 30-cm depth under agricultural land use was 25 to 35\% in silt
   loam and 19 to 25\% in the clayey soil.}},

Abstract = {{In temperate regions, the adoption of no-tillage (NT) often stimulates
   the sequestration of soil C and N and improves soil structural
   stability. The aim of this study was to investigate if NT has similar
   impacts on the stability of water-stable aggregates and C and N
   stabilization in two Oxisols (Typic Haplorthox) under different crop
   rotations. Slaking-resistant aggregates were isolated by wet sieving and
   analyzed for C and N concentrations at two agricultural experiment sites
   (Passo Fundo and Londrina) in southern Brazil. At both sites, the total
   organic C and N in the 0- to 5-cm depth interval, decreased in order
   native vegetation (NV) > NT > conventional tillage (CT). The mean weight
   diameter (MWD) of the aggregates was on average 0.5 mm greater under NT
   compared with CT, and was also greater (approximately 0.2 mm) under more
   diverse rotations, which included a leguminous green-manure crop, in
   comparison with continuous wheat (Triticam aestivum)-soybean (Glycine
   Max L.). The aggregate-size distribution was dominated (60-90\%) by
   macroaggregates (> 250 mu m). At both sites, CT decreased the proportion
   of the largest macroaggregate class (> 2000 mu m) by approximately 10\%
   in comparison with NT management, and there was a corresponding increase
   in the proportion of the 53- to 250-mu m aggregate class. In the 0- to
   5-cm soil layer of both sites, the C and N concentrations were
   significantly higher in the macroaggregates of the NT than of the CT
   systems. The lack of differences in C, N content, and ON ratio across
   aggregate-size classes indicated that these soils dominated by 1:1 clays
   and Fe/Al oxides do not express an aggregate hierarchy and that an
   increase in aggregation does not explain the increase in C and N under
   NT. In conclusion, CT decreased aggregation similarly in Oxisols as in
   temperate soils, but this decrease does not explain the loss of C and N
   because the tight feedback between soil organic matter (SOM) and
   aggregate stability (i.e., SOM being a major binding agent) observed for
   temperate soils was not found for Oxisols.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical agroecosystems are subject to degradation processes such as
   losses in Soil carbon, nutrient depletion, and reduced water holding
   capacity that occur rapidly resulting in a reduction in soil fertility
   that can be difficult to reverse. In this research, a polyphasic
   methodology has been used to investigate changes in microbial community
   structure and function in a series of tropical soils in western Kenya.
   These soils have different land usage with both wooded and agricultural
   soils at Kakamega and Ochinga, whereas at Ochinga, Leuro, Teso, and
   Ugunja a replicated field experiment compared traditional continuous
   maize cropping against an improved N-fixing fallow system. For all
   sites, principal component analysis of 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed that soil type was the key
   determinant of total bacterial community structure, with secondary
   variation found between wooded and agricultural soils. Similarly,
   phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis also separated wooded from
   agricultural soils, primarily on the basis of higher abundance of
   monounsaturated fatty acids, anteiso- and iso-branched fatty acids, and
   methyl-branched fatty acids in the wooded soils. At Kakamega and Ochinga
   wooded soils had between five 5 and 10-fold higher levels of soil carbon
   and microbial biomass carbon than agricultural soils from the same
   location, whereas total enzyme activities were also lower in the
   agricultural sites. Soils with woody vegetation had a lower percentage
   of phosphatase activity and higher cellulase and chitinase activities
   than the agricultural soils. BIOLOG analysis showed woodland soils to
   have the greatest substrate diversity. Throughout the study the two
   functional indicators (enzyme activity and BIOLOG), however, showed
   lower specificity with respect to soil type and land usage than did the
   compositional indicators (DGGE and PLFA). In the field experiment
   comparing two types of maize cropping, both the maize yields and total
   microbial biomass were found to increase with the fallow system.
   Moreover, 16S rRNA gene and PLFA analyses revealed shifts in the total
   microbial community in response to the different management regimes,
   indicating that deliberate management of soils can have considerable
   impact on microbial community structure and function in tropical soils.}},

Abstract = {{Losses of carbon (C) stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and increasing
   concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are challenges that
   scientists and policy makers have been facing in the recent past.
   Intensified agricultural practices lead to a reduction in ecosystem
   carbon stocks, mainly due to removal of aboveground biomass as harvest
   and loss of carbon as CO2 through burning and/or decomposition. Evidence
   is emerging that agroforestry systems are promising management practices
   to increase aboveground and soil C stocks and reduce soil degradation,
   as well as to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In the humid tropics,
   the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in
   vegetation can be over 70 Mg C ha(-1), and up to 25 Mg ha(-1) in the top
   20 cm of soil. In degraded soils of the sub-humid tropics, improved
   fallow agroforestry practices have been found to increase top soil C
   stocks up to 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) above continuous maize cropping. Soil
   C accretion is linked to the structural development of the soil, in
   particular to increasing C in water stable aggregates (WSA). A review of
   agroforestry practices in the humid tropics showed that these systems
   were able to mitigate N2O and CO2 emissions from soils and increase the
   CH4 Sink strength compared to cropping systems. The increase in N2O and
   CO2 emissions after addition of legume residues in improved fallow
   systems in the sub-humid tropics indicates the importance of using lower
   quality organic inputs and increasing nutrient use efficiency to derive
   more direct and indirect benefits from the system. In summary, these
   examples provide evidence of several pathways by which agroforestry
   systems can increase C sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure the productivity of smallholder maize production systems in
   Central America, increased attention must be paid to conserving soil and
   water resources. Various stakeholders from national agricultural
   research services (NARS), networks, non-governmental organizations
   (NGO's) and research institutes seek to develop and target productivity
   enhancing resource conserving management practices such as crop residue
   retention systems. To support this process, a methodology with explicit
   spatial and temporal dimensions using the DSSAT crop simulation models
   was developed and applied to the case study of residue retention in
   maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico. Systems where crop residues
   were partially or totally retained were compared with systems with no
   residue retention. Variables considered included crop production, soil
   surface runoff water, soil organic carbon and soil organic nitrogen
   content. Gridded climate surfaces and a range of soil profile scenarios
   formed the basis of the regional input. Three levels of nitrogen
   application (0, 150 and 235 kg ha(-1)) were selected to represent
   current agronomic practices. Simulation models for maize and fallow were
   run in sequence for 12 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that soil
   water holding capacity and topography affected benefits of residue
   retention much more than nitrogen management. Benefits to maize
   production from residue retention were found mainly in areas in the
   northeast of Jalisco and surrounding regions, where low precipitation
   limits maize production. Reductions in soil surface runoff due to
   residue retention were most evident in high rainfall areas in the
   central-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions. Although the effect of
   soil loss is not accounted for in DSSAT, areas of pronounced soil
   surface runoff reduction are hypothesized to be areas of productivity
   gain in the longer term. The assessment provided insight in the regional
   potential for and the soil and climate conditions under which successful
   introduction of residue retention in maize cropping systems in Jalisco
   may be achieved. In combination with socio-economic assessment studies
   and experimental work, the approach and its results contribute to
   targeted introduction of new production technologies. (C) 2004 Published

Abstract = {{Vineyards in Champagne, France are generally situated on slopes where
   the soils are subject to erosion. Therefore it is important to find a
   soil-surface management practice that protects the soil against water
   erosion. We assessed the potential of mulches or grass covers to
   stabilize soil aggregates in a calcareous sandy loam from a vineyard in
   Champagne after 9 years under different management systems. Four
   different treatments were studied: (i) a bluegrass (Poa pratensis)
   surface cover between the vine rows (GC) with bare soil under the vines
   (R); two organic mulches of (ii) coniferous (CB) or (iii) poplar (PB)
   bark that covered the entire soil surface, and (iv) bare soil between
   the rows as a control. The bark amendments were applied every 3 years at
   rates of 61 and 67 t ha(-1) for the PB and CB treatments, respectively.
   The kinetics of soil disaggregation in water fitted a power law (A=K
   t(-D)), in which K was the fraction of water-stable >200 mum aggregates
   remaining after 1 hour of wet-sieving. In the 0-5 cm layer, aggregate
   stability was greater for GC (K=21.7), CB (K=15.2) and PB (K=13.6) than
   for the control (K=10.5) and R (K=11.8). In the 0-20 cm layer, CB also
   stabilized soil aggregates (K=14.0-15.0); but PB did not. Structural
   stability was more strongly related to total organic carbon (R-2=0.64, P
   <0.001) than to microbial biomass carbon (R-2=0.54, P<0.001). A
   bluegrass cover enhanced structural stability in the 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm
   layers (K=14.2), probably because of intense root development and
   rhizodeposition enhancing microbially produced metabolites, such as
   carbohydrates. Establishing grass cover or applying bark mulch are
   effective agricultural practices that improve soil aggregate stability
   and thus should reduce soil erosion. The vegetative growth of the vines
   was greater on the soils amended with bark mulches and less on the grass
   covered soils compared with the control soil; however, no difference in
   wine quality was observed among the different treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Mollisols (called Black soils) in China are distributed primarily in the
   northeast region, which is one of the three largest Mollisol areas in
   the world. Black soils are of major agricultural importance in China.
   This study reports the physical and chemical properties of this soil
   with use of a typical Black soil profile selected in Heilongjiang
   Province, China, and standard soil analytical procedures. The soil is
   characterized with a thick (60 cm) mollic epipedon. The upper layer of
   the epipedon contains 5.8\% organic carbon, and its CEC is 43.7
   cmol(+)/kg. The macroaggregate (>0.25 mm) stability of the epipedon is
   high (between 63 and 68\% of the soil sample weight), which provides
   favorable soil structure and conditions for plant growth. Soil texture
   is clay loam for all horizons except the upper layer of the mollic
   epipedon, which is sandy clay loam. Bulk density increases with depth,
   and total porosity declines with depth, due most likely to the profile
   distribution of organic carbon (decreasing with depth). Total nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) and available water are also larger in the upper
   epipedon than the lower horizons. Overall characteristics make this soil
   fertile and productive. The results of this study can be used as

Abstract = {{The soil nitrogen (N) and carbon dynamics model SOILN (which has
   interactive links to a grass growth model), and the dual-porosity
   contaminant transport model MACRO, have been used to study environmental
   pollution arising from grazing dairy cows. The models had been
   calibrated and tested in previous studies related to livestock
   agriculture. Information about N contents and other characteristics of
   urine and faeces excreted by dairy cows was assembled from literature
   sources. Watercourse pollution by nitrate and ammonium was the main
   environmental impact considered. Denitrified nitrogen losses were also
   estimated as an indicator of nitrous oxide pollution of air. Higher
   levels of nitrate pollution in tile drains (which feed into
   watercourses) were shown to arise under grazing compared to fields
   receiving slurry and cut for silage. Much of this raised nitrogenous
   pollution arises late in the grazing season. High levels of nitrate
   pollution could be attributed to various factors, including the fact
   that cows tend to congregate in certain areas of a field at a localised
   stocking rate much higher than the overall stocking rate, and due to
   deposition of N at times when grass cannot utilise it as a plant
   nutrient. The fact that urine and faeces patches are concentrated over a
   small proportion of the field area did not give an increase in overall
   loss when this was considered along with field areas receiving no
   excretions. Rapid transport through soil macropores of ammonium from
   urine led to high pollution loads during grazing on wet soil. In
   contrast to leaching, simulated N losses by denitrification were at a
   low level, and appeared to show little variation with factors which had
   a large effect on leaching losses. Overall, the forms of pollution most
   damaging to the environment due to spatially non-uniform excretion by
   grazing animals, appeared to be leached ammonium from urine transported
   by macropore flow, and leached nitrate exacerbated both due to cows
   congregating and due to deposition at times of low plant N uptake. (C)

   of the extent to which the soil porosity is concentrated into a narrow

Abstract = {{Depending on agricultural management, soil aggregation can provide
   physical protection of organic matter against rapid decomposition.
   Within a given soil series, farm management affects the quality and
   quantity of organic inputs, soil disturbance and biological activity,
   and thereby the processes of aggregate formation (biogenic vs.
   physicogenic). We determined the physical protection of readily
   mineralizable organic matter against mineralization in undisturbed
   aggregates from a conventional arable field and a permanent pasture (>70
   years). Soil samples from the two fields were incubated at constant
   temperature and moisture content, corresponding to field capacity. The
   increase in CO, evolution due to crushing (<250 mu) of the aggregates
   was used to estimate the macroaggregate-protected C fraction. The
   fraction of C protected at the microstructural level was estimated from
   the increase in CO, evolution after ball-mill grinding. In addition,
   aggregate size distribution and bulk density and porosity of undisturbed
   soil and macroaggregates were determined. Unprotected C fractions were
   not significantly different between the management systems and ranged
   from 1.9\% to 2.4\% of total organic C. In the arable soil, 1.4\% of
   total soil organic C was physically protected in macroaggregates.
   Crushing of macroaggregates did not significantly increase C
   mineralization in the pasture soil. The results indicate that
   mineralization was considerably suppressed in the dominantly large and
   dense physicogenic macroaggregates from the arable field, but not in the
   dominantly porous, biogenic macroaggregates of the pasture soil.
   However, the protection in macroaggegates from the arable soil is not
   likely to be effective on the long-term because of the low water
   stability and the disrupting forces of cultivation under field
   conditions. A relatively high additional C mineralization from ground
   compared to crushed soil material, especially in the upper layer of the
   pasture soil, suggests a more important C protection at the
   microstructural level. Higher C protection in microaggregates from the
   pasture soil was supported by a previous micromorphological study of
   soil microstructures in thin sections of the considered management
   systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry practices in northern latitudes, although less diverse than
   those in warmer regions, have unique advantages over conventional
   land-use systems in the region in terms of water-quality enhancement,
   carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. Tree intercropping,
   especially, is a potentially promising agroforestry option in the
   region. Understanding the ecological interactions between trees and
   crops in such intercropped systems provides the basis for designing
   efficient systems with potential for wider applicability. With this
   objective, the experience from several years of research on this aspect
   at the University of Guelph, in southern Ontario, Canada are presented.
   Yields of C3 crops intercropped with trees, as well as growth of trees,
   did not differ from those in corresponding sole-stand ( conventional)
   systems of crops and trees. But, soil organic carbon content and bird
   and insect diversity increased in the intercropped area. The abundance
   and distribution of earthworms were higher closer to the tree rows
   indicating improved soil health. The C sequestration potential in
   fast-growing tree ( hybridpoplar)based intercropping systems was four
   times more than that reported for conventional agricultural fields in
   the region. Because of reduced fertilizer use and more efficient
   N-cycling, the tree-intercropping systems could also lead to the
   reduction of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields by about
   0.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Marginal or degraded land that is suitable for
   agroforestry is estimated to be 57 million ha in Canada. Tree/crop
   intercropping is one agroforestry system that shows great potential for
   this region. We suggest that this land-management option can be placed

Abstract = {{In agricultural systems, maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM) has

   No-tillage and manure amendments are management practices that can

   was tillage (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage, CT) and the subplot
   treatment was N source (manure, M; NH4NO3 fertilizer, F). The experiment
   was established in 1990 on a moderately well-drained Kennebec silt loam

Abstract = {{Soil animals are known to stimulate soil microbial activity and thereby
   to accelerate decomposition of soil organic matter. In this paper, we
   investigate potential limitations of soil animal effects on soil carbon
   flow by analysing how animal effects relate to the density of four major
   faunal groups. Specifically, we analyse the extent to which faunal
   effects are subject to biotic regulation or to mutual inhibition between
   groups under different levels of resource supply.
   In an extensive laboratory experiment, 96 microcosms established in
   three consecutive blocks were inoculated with nematodes, enchytraeids,
   microarthropods, and lumbricids. Each faunal group was inoculated in
   three densities, including combinations of groups. Introduced animal
   densities were within the natural range of densities in fallow soil.
   Bare agricultural soil and soil covered with maize litter were used as
   substrates. The microcosms were kept under constant conditions at 12
   degreesC and 50\% water holding capacity for 8 weeks. Soil CO2 evolution
   was measured daily by means of gas chromatography.
   Animal effects were on an average relatively stronger in bare soil
   (+95\% CO2; R-2 = 0.76) than in soil with litter (+14\% CO2; R-2 =
   0.40), where organic matter decomposition was seven times more intense.
   Higher animal densities generally led to accelerated decomposition up to
   three times that of the controls. However, beyond a specific density,
   decomposition rates stopped increasing or even declined, depending on
   the faunal group. In addition, animal effects were limited by mutual
   inhibition between groups in bare soil where effects were strong, while
   stimulatory interactions were prominent in the litter treatments where
   effects were generally weak.
   We interpret the limitation of soil faunal effects on soil carbon flow
   in terms of incomplete habitat exploitation and biotic regulation. Under
   conditions of substrate homogeneity, such as in the bare soil
   treatments, animal effects were stronger, but they were limited by

   in the litter treatments, animal effects were limited by incomplete
   habitat utilisation. We assume that complementary habitat colonisation
   by different faunal groups in the litter treatments gave rise to
   positive diversity effects, but that these effects did not compensate
   for reduced overall habitat utilisation. We infer that a knowledge of
   faunal resource utilisation and of mutual inhibition of faunal groups
   can be exploited for ecological soil management towards stabilisation of

Abstract = {{Identification of soil quality indicators (SQI) is important to
   sustainable management of natural resources. The objective of this
   project was to develop a technique for identifying SQIs for agricultural
   land use. Soil structure, water retention and transmission properties,
   and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured and related to
   agronomic productivity for five land use and soil management treatments
   at the experimental farm of the North Appalachian Experimental
   Watersheds, Coshocton, Ohio. The five treatments were no-till corn
   without manure (NTWM), no-till corn with manure (NTM), no-till corn (Zea
   mays)-soybean (Glycine max) rotation (NTCSR), conventional tillage corn
   (CT), and meadow (M). Soil properties measured were bulk density
   (rho(b)), drainable porosity (f(a)), available water capacity (AWC),
   steady state infiltration rate (i(c)), saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K-s), soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, water stable aggregation
   (WSA), mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), and texture. The
   correlation analysis on the measured soil attributes reduced the number
   of key variables from 17 to 11. A rating index on a 1 to 5 scale was
   obtained for each of the key soil properties. The linear regression
   analysis was first performed with key soil attributes as independent
   variables and biomass or grain yields as dependent variables, with the
   rating factor later assigned to each measured key soil attribute. The
   multiple regression analysis showed that SOC and WSA explained more than
   35\% of variability in biomass and 33\% in grain yields, respectively,
   and were identified as the major SQIs. Other important SQIs were rho(b),
   AWC, MWD, pH, and EC. The cumulative sustainability ratings (CR) for
   each land use showed that NTM was the most sustainable soil management
   treatment (CR = 20) and CT the least sustainable (CR = 30). The CR was
   also correlated significantly with grain yield (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.002).
   The CR for different land uses suggests that soil management with NTM is
   the most sustainable and CT the least.}},

Pages = {{127-138}},
Abstract = {{In the Great Plains of North America potential evaporation exceeds
   precipitation during most months of the year. About 75\% of the annual
   precipitation is received from April through September, and is
   accompanied by high temperatures and low relative humidity. Dryland
   agriculture in the Great Plains has depended on wheat production in a
   wheat-fallow agroecosystern (one crop year followed by a fallow year).
   Historically this system has used mechanical weed control practices
   during the fallow period, which leaves essentially no crop residue cover
   for protection against soil erosion and greatly accelerates soil organic
   carbon oxidation. This paper reviews the progress made in precipitation
   management in the North American Great Plains and synthesises data from
   an existing long-term experiment to demonstrate the management
   principles involved.
   The long-term experiment was established in 1985 to identify dryland
   crop and soil management systems that would maximize precipitation use
   efficiency (maximization of biomass production per unit of precipitation
   received), improve soil productivity, and increase economic return to
   the farmers in the West Central portion of the Great Plains. Embedded
   within the primary objective are subobjectives that focus on reducing
   the amount of summer fallow time and reversing the soil degradation that
   has occurred in the wheat-fallow cropping system.
   The experiment consists of four variables: 1) Climate regime; 2) Soils;
   3) Management systems; and 4) Time. The climate variable is based on
   three levels of potential evapotranspiration (ET), which are represented
   by three sites in eastern Colorado. All sites have annual long-term
   precipitation averages of approximately 400-450 mm, but vary in growing
   season open pan evaporation from 1600 mm in the north to 1975 mm in the
   south. The soil variable is represented by a catenary sequence of soils
   at each site. Management systems, the third variable, differ in the
   amount of summer fallow time and emphasize increased crop diversity. All
   systems are managed with no-till techniques. The fourth variable is
   time, and the results presented in this paper are for the first 12 yr (3
   cycles of the 4-yr system). Comparing yields of cropping systems that
   differ in cycle length and systems that contain fallow periods, when no
   crop is produced, is done with a technique called ``annualisation{''}.
   Yields are ``annualised{''} by summing yields for all crops in the
   system and dividing by the total number of years in the system cycle.
   For example in a wheat-fallow system the wheat yield is divided by two
   because it takes 2 yr to produce one crop.
   Cropping system intensification increased annualised grain and crop
   residue yields by 75 to 100\% compared to wheat-fallow. Net return to
   farmers increased by 25\% to 45\% compared to wheat-fallow. Intensified
   cropping systems increased soil organic C content by 875 and 1400 kg
   ha(-1), respectively, after 12 yr compared to the wheat-fallow system.
   All cropping system effects were independent of climate and soil
   gradients, meaning that the potential for C sequestration exists in all
   combinations of climates and soils. Soil C gains were directly
   correlated to the amount of crop residue C returned to the soil.
   Improved macroaggregation was also associated with increases in the C
   content of the aggregates. Soil bulk density was reduced by 0.01g cm(-1)
   for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition over the 12-yr period, and
   each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition increased effective porosity by
   0.3\%. No-till practices have made it possible to increase cropping
   intensification beyond the traditional wheat-fallow system and in turn
   water-use efficiency has increased by 30\% in West Central Great Plains
   agroecosystems. Cropping intensification has also provided positive
   feedbacks to soil productivity via the increased amounts of crop residue
   being returned to the soil.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic matter can modify the interaction of clay minerals with
   water, limiting the rate of water intake of swelling clays and
   stabilising soil aggregates. Soil structural stability and organic C
   content usually decrease with cultivation. Faster wetting increases
   stresses on aggregates and decreases stability. Aggregate wettabilities
   of prairie soils under 3 different management systems (grassland,
   no-till, and conventional-till) were compared in the Northern Great
   Plains of the USA. Six Ustolls and 2 Usterts were selected as
   replications along the Missouri River. Wettability was measured as water
   drop penetration time (WDPT) and as rate of water intake under 30 and
   300 mm tension. At low tension, aggregates from both cultivated fields
   and uncultivated grasslands showed similar wettability. Water intake in
   grass aggregates was attributed to a greater amount of stable pores
   relative to cultivated aggregates. In cultivated aggregates, slaking
   created planes of failure that allowed rapid water entry. Differences of
   wettability between management systems at 300 mm tension (in Ustolls,
   grasslands had greater wettability than cultivated soils, 0.24 v. 0.17 g
   water/h.g dry soil) and between soil orders (Usterts had longer WDPT
   than Ustolls, 2.9 v. 1.7 s) were explained by both clay and organic C
   contents. Simple measurements of aggregate wettability may be
   effectively used for soil quality characterisation. Aggregate
   wettability is a desirable property for agricultural soils when it is
   related to stable porosity, as may be found in high organic matter soils
   (e. g. grasslands). Wettability is excessive when fast aggregate wetting
   results in aggregate destruction as observed in low organic matter
   cultivated soils.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of the present study were: (1) to evaluate the predicting
   value of the most important European soil P tests for P leaching losses;
   and (2) to investigate how these soil P tests reflect the development of
   P depth profiles in original homogeneous soils of lysimeters. The study
   included more than 100 lysimeters, located at the Lysimeter Station
   Falkenberg/Saxony-Anhalt, UFZ-Centre for Environmental Research
   Leipzig-Halle GmbH, Germany. Soil textures were sand, sandy loam, loam
   and silt. The management forms were arable land, grassland and fallow
   with various variation in fertilisation, crop rotation and irrigation.
   Samples were collected from the A-horizons and from the whole profiles
   of eight set-aside and dismantled lysimeters at 10-cm sections. The
   concentrations of total P were determined monthly in the leachates and
   evaluated for a three-year period. The concentrations of P extracted by
   ammonium acetate lactate (AL-P), double lactate (DL-P), sodium
   bicarbonate (Olsen-P) and ammonium oxalate (OX-P) as well as P-t were
   significantly correlated with each other (P < 0.05 - P < 0.001) for
   arable soils. The relevant regression coefficients were strongly
   influenced by soil texture, soil use and management. The mean annual P
   concentrations of the leachates were in the range 0.4 - 1.2 mg l(-1) for
   sands and < 0.001 - 0.1 mg l(-1) for the textures sandy loam, loam and
   silt. These corresponded to P leaching losses of 0.001 - 2846 g ha(-1)
   yr(-1). Mean annual and maximum P concentrations and leaching losses
   were significantly (r > 0.954, P < 0.001) predicted by the OX-P
   concentrations of arable topsoils in lysimeters filled with sand. For
   sandy loam under grass the agronomic soil P tests (AL-P, DL-P and
   Olsen-P) enabled reasonable predictions of P in leachate. Under arable
   use, factors such as fertilisation, management intensity, depth of
   tillage and irrigation resulted in weak correlations between soil P
   concentrations and P in leachate. It was shown for the first time that
   all P extractants reflected P enrichments in topsoils and subsoils and
   the development of distinct depth profiles. Influence of soil use on the
   depth distribution of P was more pronounced in the 0 - 20 cm layer than
   in the subsoils. Here, the original homogeneous substrate had
   oscillating P concentrations at 10-cm increments under all soil uses.
   These could not be explained by Al-ox and Fe-ox but were significantly
   correlated with the C-t contents and bulk density. This indicates that
   vertical movement of P containing organic matter along with differences
   in porosity contributed to the heterogeneous P distribution in the
   lysimeter subsoils. This new evidence must be considered if data sets
   from long-term lysimeter experiments are used to calibrate and validate
   P leaching models.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, afforestation of agricultural land in Finland has
   caused a substantial change in land use. To assess the potential of such
   former agricultural soils for production of tree crops, information on
   soil properties is needed. The water-retention characteristics (WRC),
   bulk density (1313), organic matter (OM) concentration and particle-size
   distribution were studied in soil on afforested agricultural land in
   western Finland. Sites with an OM < 40\% in the 0-20 cm soil layer were
   sampled. Undisturbed core samples were taken from the 5-10, 15-20, 25-30
   and 35-40 cm soil depths at 38 profiles on 23 sites. The results
   suggested that the properties of former agricultural soils differ
   considerably from the pristine mineral forest soils. The sites studied
   were characterised by high OM, fine texture, gleyic properties in the
   soil profile and low air-filled porosity (AFP) at field capacity (-10
   kPa matric potential), resulting from the predomination of small pores.
   AFP was, in general, less than 20\% in the topmost soil layer and
   decreased markedly with increasing soil depth indicating deteriorating
   aeration. In mineral soils (OM < 15\% in the 0-20 cm soil depth) with a
   median particle size of <0.02 mm (clayey and silty soils) AFP was
   significantly lower than in the coarser-textured soils. In mull soils
   (OM 15-40\% in the 0-20 cm soil depth), texture did not affect AFP.
   Prediction of AFP from OM was not successful because OM controlled both
   the upper and lower limits of AFP to a similar degree. The results
   indicate that high water-table level associated with the predomination
   of fine pores in the soil leads to potential risk of restricted aeration
   and reduced forest growth. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Great Plains dryland agriculture is a risky venture because of large
   annual fluctuations in precipitation and high evaporation potentials.
   Water capture is limited by low water infiltration rates because many of
   our soils have relatively small aggregate size distributions, which
   limit infiltration, and are also susceptible to crusting and sealing.
   No-till management has permitted cropping intensification, which via
   improved water storage, has increased crop residue returned to the soil,
   decreased surface bulk density, and increased surface soil porosity. Our
   objective was to quantify the relationship between crop residue biomass
   generated by cropping system intensification and the physical properties
   of the surface soil (0-2.5-cm depth). This study was conducted within an
   existing long-term dryland experiment consisting of three sites in
   eastern Colorado that transect an evapotranspiration gradient. Each site
   transects a soil catena with three distinct soils arranged along a slope
   gradient. Only soils at the summit and toe slopes were sampled for this
   study. Soils are Argiustolls and Ustochrepts. Three no-till cropping
   systems, Wheat-Fallow (WF), Wheat-Corn-Fallow (WCF), and Continuous
   Cropping (CC), were sampled in the summer of 1998 after the cropping
   systems had been in place for 12 years. Bulk density, effective
   porosity, aggregate size distribution, sorptivity, and soil aggregate
   organic C content were measured at the surface 2.5 cm of the soil in
   each cropping system at the two soil positions at each site. Bulk
   density was reduced by 0.01 g cm(-3) for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue
   addition over the 12-year period. Each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue
   addition increased effective porosity by 0.3\%. Increases in
   macroaggregation were associated with linear increases in the C content
   of the aggregates; each g kg(-1) of organic C in the macroaggregates
   increased the proportion of macroaggregates by 4.4\%. Implementation of
   no-till intensive cropping systems under this semiarid environment
   increased, residue biomass, which has ultimately increased effective
   porosity, and thus water capture potential was increased. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Manipulating soil microbial communities using soil and crop management
   practices is a basic strategy in developing sustainable agricultural
   systems. Sustainable farming is based, in part, on the efficient
   management of soil microorganisms to improve soil quality. However, the
   identification of biological indicators of soil quality that can be used
   to predict weed suppression in soils has received little attention. We
   investigated differences in soil microbial activity among various crop
   and soil management systems to assess: (i) the microbiological
   characteristics of these soils; (ii) determine whether any relationships
   existed that might be used in the development of weed suppression. Soil
   enzyme activity, water-stable aggregates, and the proportions of
   weed-suppressive bacteria were compared among seven cropping systems and
   one native-prairie ecosystem in mid-Missouri, USA. Assays of soil
   enzymes (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase)
   revealed that organic and integrated cropping systems, and the
   native-prairie ecosystem had the highest levels of soil activity. Weed
   rhizospheres from these same ecosystems also had greater proportions of
   bacterial isolates characterized as ``growth suppressive{''} to green
   foxtail (Setaria viridis {[}L.] Beauv.) and field bindweed (Convolvulus

   soil aggregates was the greatest in soils with the highest organic
   matter and was found to be related to higher enzyme and weed-suppressive
   activity. Selected biological indicators of soil quality were associated
   with potential weed-suppressive activity in soil when that soil was

   Well structured soils at all depths had densities that were usually less

   with macroporosity greater than 18\% and 10\%, respectively. Poorly
   structured soils had densities always greater than 1.44 Mg m(-3), and
   commonly greater than 1.5 Mg m(-3), equating with a macroporosity of 9\%
   and 5\%, respectively. These values, together with data on pore sizes
   and morphology, correspond with acceptable versus limiting porosity. An
   intergrade between these limits described moderately poorly structured
   soils. The degree of compaction was best explained by considering its
   spatial distribution. This showed that the most severe compaction
   occurred within 2 km of the river, near the principal town, and between
   an archaeological site and the river. This land has been used for 3000
   to 4000 years. In contrast, well structured soils occurred in the
   southwest away from the main settlement and on land reclaimed from
   marshland in 1958 and cultivated for about 40 years. Land not belonging
   to these groups has been cultivated for about 400 years and is located
   further from the river and the settlement than the severely compacted
   soils and has a moderately poor structure. Poor correlations were found
   between soil structure and clay mineralogy and calcium carbonate. Clay
   content was significant but accounted for only 21\% of the variation.
   The role of organic matter was clearer despite small but statistically
   significant numerical differences between moderately poorly structured
   soils together with very poorly structured soils (0-40 cm), compared
   with well structured soils.
   The more poorly structured soils had a mean organic matter content of
   1.45\% compared with 2.1\% for well structured soils (0 to 40 cm). Thin
   sections suggested that the soil structure in compact soils had been
   produced by tillage, partial or total aggregate collapse, and from
   shrinkswell activity rather than nonplant biota. This is interpreted by
   the presence of vughs, planar voids, and curvo-planar voids that
   partially isolate former peds. Biopores and microaggregates comprising
   coprogenic fragments are rare. A sequence of steps for the formation of
   severe compaction is suggested with possible remedial actions
   identified. This work demonstrates that an holistic approach to soil
   management is required to remediate compaction and that this should take
   into account the historical aspects of agricultural development and good
   practice in machinery management.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports the soil characteristics and constraints to
   agricultural production in inland valley bottom wetlands in southwestern
   Nigeria. The soils have high silt and clay fractions in the surface
   horizons, and soil texture vary remarkably from sandy to clayey both
   within and among the bottomlands. Bulk density averaged 0.96 g/cm(3) in
   the 30 cm topsoil layer and increased substantially to 1.57 g/cm(3) with
   depth. Non-capillary porosity averaged 0.287 and 0.127 cm(3)/cm(3) in
   the respective depth zones. Similarly, saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K-sat) averaged 4.45 and 1.38 cm/h, respectively. The soils were well
   supplied with the exchangeable bases, especially Ca and Mg. Organic
   carbon levels were high, while available phosphorus was moderately high.
   The main constraints to agricultural production are the small size of
   the valley bottoms, low subsoil water transmission and poor drainage,
   and weed growth. Poor drainage can be alleviated by adapting the farming
   of the land to the wet condition, example, by growing rice or by
   introducing mound-tillage, and growing rice at the base and a
   toposequence of ``dry foot{''} crops on the mounds. Mound-tillage with
   shallow drainage ditches can also be used to improve soil-water
   relations for dryland farming in the bottomlands. These soil and water
   management practices will enhance intensive uses of the potentially
   productive inland valley bottoms and increases in the productivity of
   the farmers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the altitudinal and successional trends in microbial
   biomass and to understand their role in soil nutrient dynamics during
   the aggradation phase (vegetation recovery) of abandoned shifting
   cultivation systems, we determined the soil properties and microbial C
   and N in jhum (slash-and-burn) cultivation systems at different
   altitudes and 1-, 7-, and 16-year-old fallow agricultural lands at lower
   and higher altitudes in the northeastern Indian hills. Density of ground
   vegetation was lower in the undisturbed forest than in the jhum fallows.
   In general, 1-year jhum fallow had greater herbaceous vegetation both at
   lower and higher altitudes. Although woody plants were observed in 7-
   and 16-year-old jhum fallows, their density was highest in the forest.
   Soil moisture, organic C, and total N also increased gradually with
   increasing altitude and progressive secondary succession. Soil pH showed
   a negative correlation with altitude (as also confounded by soil type)
   and fallow age. Both microbial C and N had a close correlation with
   altitude and fallow age. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic C
   was 2.0-2.6\% and microbial N to total N 1.4-2.2\% in jhum fields,
   2.4-4.3\% and 1.2-2.1\%, respectively, in jhum fallows, and 2.5-2.9\%
   and 1.6-1.9\% in the forests. Microbial C and N showed a negative
   correlation with herbaceous plant density. Microbial biomass in the jhum
   fallows and forest stands had a positive relationship with woody
   vegetation. Along an altitudinal and/or successional gradient, microbial
   C and N were positively correlated with water-holding capacity, soil
   moisture, organic C, and total N and negatively correlated with soil pH.
   Microbial C and N were positively correlated with each other. Therefore,
   the study suggests that the altitudinal and successional dynamics of
   microbial C and N are linked to, among other properties, soil organic
   matter and total nitrogen contents in the soil during community
   development after land abandonment from shifting cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the effects of conventional and organic arable farming on
   soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil structure, aggregate stability
   and C and N mineralization, which are considered important factors in
   defining sustainable land management. Within one soil series, three
   different farming systems were selected, including a conventional and an
   organic arable system and permanent pasture without tillage. The old
   pasture represents optimal conditions in terms of soil structure and
   organic matter inputs and is characterized by high earthworm activity.
   More than 70 years of different management has caused significant
   differences in soil properties. SOM content, mineralization, earthworm
   activity and water-stable aggregation decreased as a result of tillage
   and arable cropping when compared with pasture, but were significantly
   greater under organic farming than under conventional farming. Total SOM
   contents between 0 and 20 cm depth amounted to 15, 24 and 46 g kg(-1)
   for the conventional arable, organic arable and permanent pasture
   fields, respectively. Although less sensitive to slaking than the
   conventionally managed field, the soil under organic farming was
   susceptible to compaction when high pressures were exerted on the soil
   under wet conditions. The beneficial effects of organic farming are
   generally associated with soil biochemical properties, but soil physical
   aspects should also be considered. Depending on soil type and climate,
   organic farmers need to be careful not to destroy the soil structure, so
   that they can enjoy maximum advantage from their organic farming

Abstract = {{Soluble organic matter and its biodegradability are important in
   relation to soil nutrient fluxes, carbon (C) sequestration, and water
   quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quantity and
   biodegradability of soluble organic matter in soil under monoculture
   maize or maize - soybean rotation, and different amendments: manure,
   inorganic fertilizer, or no amendment. We characterized organic matter
   extracted in cold and hot (80 degreesC) water by using a bioassay
   involving incubation of the extracts (after inoculation with soil
   microflora) at 35 degreesC for 42 days. Soluble organic C and organic
   and mineral nitrogen (N) were monitored during the incubation. Extracts
   of whole soil (015 cm depth) and three water-stable aggregate size
   classes (>1000, 1000-250, and 250-50 mum) were subjected to the bioassay
   in order to evaluate the physical disposition and kinetics of soluble
   organic matter.
   Hot water-soluble C accounted for about 70\% of the total (cold+hot)
   water-soluble organic matter. Organic N was the major form of N in the
   extracts; it comprised 61-83\% of the total N extracted with cold water
   and 87-97\% of the total N extracted with hot water. The quantity of
   soluble organic matter that was biodegradable was related to the
   extraction procedure and the management history of the soil. The
   proportion of soluble C and organic N that was biodegradable was
   greatest in hot water extracts and greater in manured than nonmanured
   soils. During the bioassay, proportionately greater amounts of organic N
   were metabolized relative to organic C, so that the C:N ratios of the
   extracts widened as the incubation progressed, indicating that the
   soluble organic matter was rich in labile organic N. The rate at which
   soluble organic matter decomposed (i.e., turnover) was not related to
   the type of input. Decomposition data fitted a double exponential decay
   model, suggesting that the soluble organic matter comprised two
   fractions: a rapidly decomposable fraction (containing 29-36\% of the
   total soluble C) with a turnover time of < 1 day, and a slowly
   decomposable fraction with a turnover time of about 80 days.
   The concentration of soluble organic matter in soil aggregates was
   related to aggregate size; the concentration was greatest in the largest
   aggregates and it decreased with decreasing aggregate size. Soluble
   organic C extracted from aggregates also comprised two kinetically
   discrete pools. The turnover time (i.e., mean residence time) of each
   pool was not affected by amendment, crop rotation, or aggregate size.
   However, the slowly decomposable organic C pool was larger in
   microaggregates (<250 mum) than in macroaggregates, whereas the rapidly
   decomposable pool was larger in macroaggregates. We conclude that
   water-soluble organic matter in maize-cropped soils comprises two
   kinetically defined fractions and is readily decomposable due to its
   high content of hydrophilic, labile N-rich compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of some soils in the high rainfall zone of Nigeria to
   soil erosion must be measured regularly for better soil management. A
   number of techniques have been adopted for the determination of this
   soil loss parameter. The aim of this study is to determine the soil
   characteristics that relate significantly to erodibility. Soil samples
   collected from 0-20 cm depth from 10 different locations in the upper
   rainforest area were analysed for particle size distribution,
   water-stable aggregates, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, soil
   dispersion and aggregating indices. The soils are mainly Acrisols,
   Nitosols, Gleysols and Ferralsol in the FAO classification while their
   textures are sands to sandy-clay-loam. They are very unstable in water
   as reflected in the higher values of WSA >0.50 mm and the mean-weight
   diameter that ranged from 0.50 to 2.03 mm. The dispersion ratio for the
   soils are between 0.26 and 0.69 while clay dispersion ratio also ranged
   from 0.24 to 0.80. Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE)
   crodibility model values (K) were from 0.03 to 0.06 Mg hMJ(-1) mm(-1).
   These parameters can be effectively used in predicting soil erodibility,
   though their predictability varied in ranking of soil erodibility. In
   spite of this variability these indices can be used for potential
   erosion hazard determination by agricultural extension staff to avoid
   crop failures and other negative influence of soil erosion. The soil
   parameters are easy to determine and will be a valuable instrument when
   faster approaches to erosion control measures are required. Copyright

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was evaluated under three land
   use practices on sloping land of Kolombangara in Solomon Islands
   (5-12degreesS, 155-170degreesW). Three soil management treatments were:
   (1) natural forest, (2) traditional farming practice, and (3) topsoil
   removal. The SOC concentration was high in the surface layer of soil
   under natural forest and decreased sharply with depth. The SOC
   concentration of the 0-15 cm depth was significantly greater under
   natural forest (67 g kg(-1)) compared to the traditional farming (24 g
   kg(-1)) and topsoil removal (7 g kg(-1)) treatments. The depletion of
   SOC concentration in traditional farming and topsoil removal treatments
   decreased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates. In
   this strongly structured soil, the traditional farming treatment had no
   detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of
   the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC
   concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference
   in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the
   topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on
   slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer
   by 52.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool
   in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha(-1) compared with
   natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as
   in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse
   impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there
   is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn
   agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard,
   a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to

   macro-aggregates (WSA) (>250 mum), particulate (POM) (>53 mum), and
   light fraction (U) organic matter, for the 0- to 10-cm soil depth, were
   assessed at 14 agricultural experimental sites established on Gleysolic,
   Podzolic, Luvisolic, and Brunisolic soils in the cool, humid region of
   eastern Canada. Organic C and N in the clay plus silt particles was at
   or near the capacity level for soils with clay plus silt content < 40\%.
   For soils with >60\% clay plus silt, the degree of saturation was
   65-70\% indicating a potential for further organic C and N retention.
   The mean proportion of C and N found in the POM was 22 and 27\%, while
   the LF organic matter contained 7 and 5\% C and N, respectively. Mean
   soil WSA content, determined by wet-sieving analysis, was 42\% for

   Water-stable macro-aggregate C content was proportional to soil organic
   C (r = 0.96, P < 0.01). At four of the sites, where soil C and N were
   influenced by management, an increasing level of soil organic C and N
   was associated with both the clay plus silt particles and the POM
   fraction until the former was saturated. Once the capacity level was
   saturated, further organic C and N accumulation was associated with the

   effects on irrigation requirements were estimated with a simple soil
   water balance model. The experimental design was replicated five times

   PMR composted alone (PMRC), PMR composted with bark (PMRB), and peat
   applied at two rates and a nonamended control. All amended treatments
   significantly increased total soil C relative to the nonamended control
   following applications in 1998 and 1999. One year following the second
   serial amendment, all PMR treatments increased PAW by 5 to 45\% relative
   to the control. There was a significant positive linear relationship
   between total soil C and PAW. All amended treatments reduced the average
   amount of irrigation water required for potato production by 4 to 30\%
   and the number of irrigation events by 10 to 90\%. There was a clear
   trend of greater reduction in irrigation requirements with more carbon
   added. The cumulative effects of repeated additions of PMRB suggest that
   certain composts might sustain elevated PAW and reduce irrigation
   requirements beyond one year.}},

Abstract = {{To detect soil changes related to vegetation and fertility restoration
   in a long fallow agricultural system of the Venezuelan Andes, 32 soil (A
   horizon, 0- 15 cm depth) and litter characteristics were studied in
   plots at different stages of the fallow-cultivation cycle. Four sectors
   of the valley were sampled, each one including seven plots: recently
   ploughed after a long fallow period; 1 and 2 years under potato crop; 1,
   4 5 and 8 years in fallow and natural vegetation. Each sector had
   similar topography, parent material and exposure to reduce the spatial
   heterogeneity that can hinder the synchronic analysis of the succession.
   Data of each sector were standardized before the statistics comparisons.
   Although all soils were acidic, those involved in the cropping cycle, or
   with only 1 year of fallow, had a significantly lower pH than the
   others, indicating that soil cultivation triggered off acidifying
   processes intense enough to overcome the strong buffering indices of the
   soils. These acidifying processes, facilitated by the acidity generating
   ions that widely dominate the desaturated CEC, are surely due to the
   stimulation of litter and soil organic matter mineralization after
   ploughing the soil and also to the N fertilization of the cultivated
   soils. The high soil contents of exchangeable Al3+ and free Al oxides
   suggest that Al plays an important role in SOM stabilization, lowering
   its mineralization. No successional increase of any main plant nutrient
   was found in soil or litter. Moreover, soil available P and litter-P
   contents are higher during the cultivation phase and at the beginning of
   the succession, probably as a consequence of fertilization. Water
   holding capacity was similar for all soils, indicating that this long
   fallow agriculture system does not change the water storage capability
   of the soil, an important aspect for the role of the paramo in the
   regional water balance. The main characteristics of soils and litters,
   including their delta C-13 values, were useless to monitor soil changes
   during cultivation and fallowing. Nevertheless, the delta N-15 values of
   SOM decreased steadily along the crop-fallow chronosequence, while those
   of litterfall were rather constant from recently ploughed to 1 year
   fallow soils, decreasing suddenly on medium fallow, plots and again on
   the virgin paramo. Together, the delta N-15 values of soil- and litter-N
   grouped the soils following the crop-fallow chronosequence, suggesting
   that a change from `open' to `closed' N cycling is the characteristic
   that better discriminates the soils along the succession. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Pores and organic matter take a multitude of forms in soil and their
   characteristics change in space and time following a change in tillage
   practices as a new ``steady state{''} is approached. Information on the
   variation with depth (stratification) in the characteristics of pores
   and organic matter and the rates of change in these characteristics is
   vital to interpreting the short- and long-term impacts of a reduction of
   tillage on the productivity and hydrology of agricultural soils. This
   information is also of value in estimating the effect of a reduction in
   tillage on the sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils. Recent
   literature comparing conventional tillage (CT) with no-till (NT) in
   temperate agroecosystems with varying soil textures and climates was
   reviewed for the purpose of assessing rates of change in the magnitude
   and stratigraphy of bulk density, porosity, pore size classes, organic
   matter content and organic matter fractions. The influence of tillage on
   bulk density, macroporosity and organic matter content was found to be
   documented more extensively than the effects on pore size distribution,
   soil organic matter fractions and their interactions at different soil
   depths. Many of the reports documenting tillage-induced changes in soil
   porosity and organic matter were based on measurements at a specific
   time after initiating the tillage trial. Results obtained by different
   investigators were found to be most consistent when measurements were
   made greater than or equal to 15 years after initiating the tillage
   trial. Data from different studies were used to generalize trends in
   pore and organic matter characteristics with depth and time. However,
   few studies provided measurements that permitted accurate prediction of
   either the rates of change or the maximum change that will occur
   following a change from CT to NT. Future research must enhance our
   ability to make these predictions if we wish to garner a better
   understanding of the effects of NT on the quality and productivity of
   agricultural soils and their ability to sequester carbon. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Ferralsols have a macrostructure that is weak to moderate and a strong
   microstructure consisting of near spherical microaggregates. We have
   studied the evolution of the structure under changing land use in two
   Ferralsols under a native Cerrado and under pasture sowed after recent
   clearing by measuring bulk density. We studied the microaggregates'
   characteristics and resulting porosity using scanning electron
   microscopy and mercury porosimetry, respectively. Microaggregates 50-300
   mum in diameter are attributed to termites. They were in a much closer
   arrangement from the surface to 1 m depth under pasture than under
   Cerrado. Larger microaggregates, 500-1000 mum in diameter, that are
   closely packed, resulted from earthworm activity. They were more
   numerous under pasture than under Cerrado. Thus within a few years,
   clearing and grazing have caused a dramatic decrease in microstructure
   that is one of the rare favourable characteristics of Ferralsols for
   agriculture. This evolution that affects the subsoil to 80-90 cm cannot
   be attributed to compaction by mechanical deforestation alone but seems
   to result from a change in the faunal activity in the soil. Finally, the
   packing of the clay particles within the microaggregates was similar
   whatever the type of microaggregate and land use. Our results accord
   with earlier studies showing that the porosity resulting from clay
   packing varies little in Ferralsols in which the fine material is mainly

Abstract = {{The beef feedlot industry in Australia produces a large amount of solid
   organic by-product each year that is currently applied to agricultural
   land as a fertiliser supplement. Manure is known to be a valuable source
   of organic matter and some plant nutrients, especially nitrogen and
   phosphorus. In addition, manure contains excessive quantities of cations
   such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K), which may result in long-term
   sustainability problems for the soil, particularly when large amounts
   are applied over short time periods. The aim of this study was to
   determine the effects of composted beef feedlot manure when applied to
   agricultural soils.
   Two sites were selected, one a brown Dermosol and the other a red
   Kurosol, both in north-eastern Victoria near the Rutherglen Research
   Institute. Both sites received rates of manure up to 109 t/ha in 1996.
   In 1997 soil samples were collected and compared with untreated control
   soils. The Dermosol site was sown to an oat and clover mixture in 1996
   and 1997 and the red Kurosol was sown to lupin in 1996 and wheat in
   1997. The application of composted bovine manure resulted in a 1\%
   increase in soil organic carbon, an increase in soil pH by 1.5 units,
   increased levels of magnesium, calcium, nitrogen and K in the surface 10
   cm soil layer at both sites and an increase in extractable phosphorus
   levels in the subsoil. There was no detectable increase in surface Na,
   although there was a small but significant decrease in Na in the 40-80
   cm soil layer. It is suggested that soluble organic compounds, migrating
   down through the soil profile are able to complex with Na and
   effectively remove some of this cation from the exchange sites of the
   clay surfaces. In addition, the high porosity of these soils coupled
   with the high degree of Na mobility ensures that most of this cation is
   transported deeper into the soil profile. The beneficial effects of
   applying composted manure are promising as a means of reducing sodicity
   although these results will require further validation. In addition, the
   long-term effects of saturating subsurface soil with Na are also a cause
   for concern and need to be further investigated.}},

   with no deleterious increase in the proportion of 0.10 mm aggregates.
   Solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy indicated a decrease in O-alkyl and
   alkyl C under pasture and cropping compared with forest soils, which was
   in agreement with the decline in the macro-C fraction. Characterisation
   of C chemistry following UV photo-oxidation showed that charcoal C
   (dominant presence of aryl C) accounted for 30\% of the total soil
   organic C, while other functional groups (polysaccharides and alkyl C)
   were probably protected within micro-aggregates. Based on soil organic C
   and aggregate stability determinations alone, the implications for soil
   physical quality, soil loss, and diffuse pollution appear minimal.}},

Pages = {{1267-1286}},
Abstract = {{Attributes of 21 Vertosols in 2 different regions of Tasmania were
   assessed using field and laboratory techniques to determine differences
   associated with 3 local forms of agricultural management ( long-term
   pasture, rain-fed cropping, and irrigated cropping). Vertosols in the
   northern Midlands had better physical properties ( lesser bulk density
   and penetration resistance, and greater porosities and water holding
   capacities), poorer nutrient status ( lower pH, exchangeable bases, and
   extractable P), and better biological properties ( greater organic
   carbon (OC), carbon fractions F1 and F3, and more worms) than
   south-eastern Vertosols. When adjusted for clay content, cropped sites
   had less soil OC than pasture sites at 0-75 mm depth. Readily oxidisable
   ( fraction F1) carbon in the surface 75 mm was 3.6 mg/g and 6.9 mg/g
   under long-term pasture compared with 2.5 mg/g and 3.9 mg/g in irrigated
   cropped paddocks on south-eastern and Midlands sites, respectively. Soil
   organic carbon values were positively correlated with physical and
   chemical soil properties. Long-term pasture paddocks showed stronger
   structural development and had smaller aggregates than cropped paddocks,
   which had more larger clods. Vane shear strength and penetration
   resistance were less in rainfed cropped paddocks compared with long-term
   pasture but this effect was not apparent on irrigated cropped paddocks.
   Farmers considered that a majority of their soil attributes were healthy
   under all management histories but strategies for maintaining organic
   matter levels and minimising clod formation by tillage are essential for
   long-term sustainable use of these Vertosols.}},

Abstract = {{The annual production of olive fruits in Jordan is about 105,000 tons

   solid waste (OMW) contains 94\% organic matter and, therefore, can be
   highly beneficial to agricultural soil. However, olive waste contains
   oil that may increase soil hydrophobicity and decrease water retention
   and infiltration rate. In this research, the impact of OMW on water
   retention, saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and
   capillary rise of three soils, loam, clay loam, and dune sand, has been
   investigated under laboratory conditions. Application of OMW resulted in
   an increase in water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity but
   caused a decrease in capillary rise and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity for all soils tested. The increase in water retention has
   been observed at all levels of pressure potential and was significantly
   different at 3 bars or higher. The highest increase in saturated
   hydraulic conductivity occurred at 4\% application rate at which about
   300\%, 200\%, and only 12\% increase was observed for loam, clay loam,
   and dune sand. respectively. Application of OMW caused a significant
   decrease in the capillary rise ranging from 11.5\% for dune sand to 70\%
   for clay loam soil. Capillary rises were inversely related to the OMW

Abstract = {{The West Asia-North Africa (WANA) region has a land area of 1.7 billion
   ha, and a population of 600 million. Desertification and soil
   degradation are severe problems in the region. The problem of drought
   stress is exacerbated by low and erratic rainfall and soils of limited
   available water holding capacity and a soil organic carbon (SOC) content
   of less than 0.5 per cent. The SOC pool of most soils has been depleted
   by soil degradation and widespread use of subsistence and exploitative
   farming systems. The historic loss of a SOC pool for the soils of the
   WANA region may be 6-12 Pg compared with the global loss of 66-90 Pg.
   Assuming that 60 per cent of the historic loss can be resequestered, the
   total soil-C sink capacity of the WANA region may be 3-7 Pg. This
   potential may be realized through adoption of measures to control
   desertification, restore degraded soils and ecosystems, and improve soil
   and crop management techniques that can enhance the SOC pool and improve
   soil quality. The strategies of soil C sequestration include integrated
   nutrient management (INM) and recycling, controlled grazing, and growing
   improved fodder species on rangeland. Improved technologies for cropland
   include use of INM and biofertilizers, appropriate tillage methods and
   residue management techniques, crop rotations and cover crops, and water

Abstract = {{Soil aggregation and soil structure are fundamental properties of
   natural and managed ecosystems. However, most of our knowledge on the
   role of plant species in soil aggregation is derived from work in
   agroecosystems or with agriculturally important plants. Here we examined
   the effects of five plant species on soil aggregate water stability. The
   five species (three grasses, one forb, and a legume) were from the same
   natural grassland, and were grown in monoculture plots in the field. Our
   first goal was to test if productivity-related or species-specific
   factors would prevail in determining soil aggregation. We also tested
   what the relative importance of the soil protein glomalin (produced by
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF) in soil aggregation is, compared to
   other factors, including AMF hyphal and root length and percent plant
   cover. We found significant differences in soil aggregate water
   stability (1-2 mm size class) for the five plant species examined, and
   corresponding differences in plant cover, root weight and length, AMF
   soil hyphal length, and glomalin concentrations. A structural equation
   modeling approach (path analysis) was used to distinguish direct from
   indirect effects of factors on soil aggregation based on covariance
   structures. Root length, soil glomalin, and percent cover contributed
   equally strong paths to water-stable aggregation. The direct effect of
   glomalin was much stranger than the direct effect of AMF hyphae
   themselves, suggesting that this protein is involved in a very important
   hypha-mediated mechanism of soil aggregate stabilization, at least for
   the 1-2-mm size class of aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Soil gas movement is an important issue in many agricultural and
   environmental fate studies, including soil aeration conditions, water
   evaporation cycles, volatile organic compound migration, and soil
   compaction phenomena. When modeling soil gas movement in the vadose
   zone, the simultaneous water flow and heat flux should be included. This
   requires that the gaseous diffusion coefficient, which is an important
   input parameter, must be not only a function of soil air-filled porosity
   but also a function of soil temperature. An empirical equation for
   estimating the gaseous diffusion coefficient for conditions of changing
   soil air-filled porosity and temperature was developed in this study.
   This equation was developed using de Vries and Partington theories. It
   was then calibrated and partially verified with two independent sets of
   experimental data. Good agreement was obtained between predicted and
   measured values (R-2 = 0.998) although literature data for rigorous
   verifications of the equation for conditions of simultaneous changing
   soil temperature and air-filled porosity was not available. Simulations
   show that diurnal soil temperature variations affected the gaseous
   diffusion coefficient near the soil surface. This study suggests that
   concomitant impacts of soil temperature and air-fifled porosity upon
   gaseous diffusion coefficient should be considered when modeling gas
   movement in the surface of the vadose zone soil. The equation presented
   here may be applied to estimate gaseous diffusion coefficients in
   natural soil conditions where gas movement depends both on soil
   air-filled porosity and temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable agroecosystem management generally entails increased
   management ability and input. Decision making for sustainable management
   could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of
   soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns.
   Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically
   based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions.
   We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative
   indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into
   location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to
   assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter
   management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI.
   Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for
   two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At
   each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices:
   land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets
   were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and
   micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable
   aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity.
   Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest
   set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at
   least 85\% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We
   defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil
   quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess
   sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS
   against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management
   sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal
   contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of
   determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an
   average R(2) = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an
   additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between
   management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low
   rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of
   treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil
   properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed
   indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality
   index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.}},

Abstract = {{We assert that the simulation of fine-scale crop growth processes and
   agronomic adaptive management using coarse-scale climate change
   scenarios lower confidence in regional estimates of agronomic adaptive
   potential. Specifically, we ask: 1) are simulated yield responses to
   low-resolution climate change, after adaptation (without and with
   increased atmospheric CO2), significantly different from simulated yield
   responses to high-resolution climate change, after adaptation (without
   and with increased atmospheric CO2)? and 2) does the scale of the soils
   information, in addition to the scale of the climate change information,
   affect yields after adaptation? Equilibrium (1 x CO2 versus 2 x CO2)
   climate changes are simulated at two different spatial resolutions in
   the Great Plains using the CSIRO general circulation model (low
   resolution) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
   RegCM2 regional climate model (high resolution). The EPIC crop model is
   used to simulate the effects of these climate changes; adaptations in
   EPIC include earlier planting and switch to longer-season cultivars.
   Adapted yields (without and with additional carbon dioxide) are compared
   at the different spatial resolutions. Our findings with respect to
   question 1 suggest adaptation is more effective in most cases when
   simulated with a higher resolution climate change than its more
   generalized low resolution equivalent. We are not persuaded that the use
   of high resolution climate change information provides insights into the
   direct effects of higher atmospheric CO2 levels on crops beyond what can
   be obtained with low resolution information. However, this last finding
   may be partly an artifact of the agriculturally benign CSIRO and RegCM2
   climate changes. With respect to question 2, we found that high
   resolution details of soil characteristics are particularly important to
   include in adaptation simulations in regions typified by soils with poor
   water holding capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Polyclonal antisera were raised against cell walls of a soil aggregating
   basidiomycete isolated in eastern Montana (isolate BB1) which has been
   identified as a member of the russuloid clade using molecular genetic
   techniques. In cross-reactivity tests using quantitative enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polyclonal antisera to BB I cross-reacted
   significantly with fungal species representative of the russuloid clade
   and little or no reactivity was observed with fungal species of the
   polyporoid, euagaric, hymenochaetoid, bolete and gomphoid-phalloid
   clades of the Homobasidiomycetes. These results suggested that the cell
   walls of fungal species from the russuloid clade share common antigenic
   binding sites that are recognizable by the polyclonal antibodies and
   that these sites were not found or were present in small amounts in
   fungal species from the other clades. Experiments on the water stability
   of artificial aggregates amended with fungal species representative of
   these six homobasidiomycete clades indicated that many species of the
   russuloid clade were very efficient soil stabilizers. Fungal species
   from the other clades vary in their ability to aggregate soil particles
   but cross-react weakly with the antibodies. ELISA was used on water
   stable aggregates (WSA) from soil samples of three dryland locations

   undisturbed for 30 years. Greater antigenic response was observed from
   WSA of undisturbed soils compared to cultivated soils and from WSA of

Abstract = {{Austrian and Hungarian agricultural soils (3 transects with different

   of total porosity soil aggregate stability and of coarse pores. In the
   uncultivated areas a more crumby structure was observed, whereas in the
   tilled soils a subangular, cracky microstructure was developed. The
   cultivated soils showed a decrease of soil organic matter, of CECeff, a
   loss of nutrients, a reduced microbial activity, a reduction of root
   growth and faunal activities in the tillaged horizons. In the Hungarian
   soil an enhanced content of heavy metals (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sr,
   Zn) were found due to application of high dosages of P-fertilizers. In
   Austria a higher Cd-content could be traced. The microbial activities

   biomass and activity, an increase in mobile humic acids and increased
   water infiltration rates and soil water-holding capacity. Pesticide use

Abstract = {{Carbon mineralization kinetics of 17 organic materials were studied in a
   Mediterranean sandy soil. These added organic matters (AOM) used in the
   organic fertilizer industry differed in their origin and composition:
   plant residues from the agri-food industry, animal wastes, manures
   (plant and animal origin), composts at different composting times and
   organic fertilizers. The mixtures AOM-soils were incubated under aerobic
   conditions at 28 degreesC during 6 months. Soil moisture was maintained
   at 75\% water holding capacity and respired-CO2 was regularly trapped
   into alkali media in closed chambers, then checked by HCl titration.
   Analyses of CO2 were performed in triplicate at 17 sampling occasions.
   The mineralized AOM fraction (MAOMF) varied according to the AOM origin:
   from 12-33\% of added C for composts, to 65-90\% for animal-originated
   AOM, with many intermediate patterns for plant-originated AOM. Seven
   decomposition models from the literature were fitted to actual MAOMF:
   (a) three consecutive models with two 1st-order-kinetic compartments and
   three parameters (ml. humification: m2, exchange: m3, decomposition),
   (b) three parallel models (m4. with two compartments and three
   parameters: m8. a i st-order plus 0-order model with three parameters;
   m4. a three-compartment model with four parameters). and (c) m7, a model
   with one 2nd-order-kinetic compartment and two parameters. Additionally,
   m6. a simplified version of m5 was proposed. Models m2 and m7 did not
   match with actual data or gave a poor fit. By the correlation
   parameters, the most simple model m4 was chosen instead of the
   consecutive models rn 1 and rn3. Residual sums of squares were always
   greater-but not significantly -in m8 than in m4 which confirmed the
   superiority of the models with two Ist-order compartments against 1
   st-order plus 0-order models for incubation times higher than 100 days.
   Model m5 (most of its parameters being not correlated) gave the best
   predictions of our data. The proposed m6 version gave e predictions with
   similar precision as m4 and appeared powerful with only two parameters
   (very labile and stable ii actions of the AOM). A compromise between the
   precision of the predictions and the simplicity of the formulae allowed

Abstract = {{Reduced tillage of agricultural soils has been shown to result in
   greater macroaggregation, microbial biomass and microbial diversity.
   While it has been shown that macroaggregates contain more microbial
   biomass per unit soil mass than microaggregates, it is unclear how
   microbial diversity varies with soil aggregation. We investigated the
   functional diversity (catabolic potential) of bacteria, evaluated by
   calculating Shannon's diversity index (H'), substrate richness (S) and
   substrate evenness (E) from potential substrate utilization patterns, in
   whole soil (i.e. not separated into different aggregate sizes) and
   aggregates of different sizes (2-4, 1-2, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5, and 0.1-0.25
   mm diameter) in loam and silt loam soils grown to barley and managed for
   6 years under conventional tillage (CT) or zero tillage (ZT) systems in
   northern British Columbia. There were no significant tillage effects on
   bacterial diversity in whole soils. In soil aggregates, H' and E were
   significantly higher under CT than under ZT on the loam at barley
   planting time, with no significant aggregate size effects. However, at
   barley-heading stage, all diversity indices in both soils were
   significantly higher under ZT than under CT, and they tended to increase
   with increasing aggregate size. Cluster analysis and principal component
   analysis of substrate utilization patterns also revealed differences in
   bacterial community structures between CT and ZT,but the substrates that
   were utilized differently between the two tillage systems were not the
   same between soil types or sampling times. The results during the
   cropping cycle imply that deterioration of soil structure is probably
   one factor that explains the adverse effects of soil tillage on soil

Abstract = {{While soil biota and processes are becoming increasingly appreciated as

   research. In a sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] field experiment
   in which CO2 {[}supplied using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)
   technology] was crossed factorially with an irrigation treatment, soil
   aggregate (1-2 mm) water stability increased in response to elevated
   CO2. Aggregate water stability was increased by 40\% and 20\% in
   response to CO2, at ample and limited water supply treatments,
   respectively. Soil hyphal lengths of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   increased strongly (with a threefold increase in the dry treatment) in
   response to CO2, and the concentrations of one fraction (easily
   extractable glomalin, EEG) of the AMF-produced protein glomalin were
   also increased. Two fractions of glomalin, and AMF hyphal lengths were
   all positively correlated with soil aggregate water stability. The
   present results further support the hypothesis that AMF can become
   important in global change scenarios. Although in this field study a
   causal relationship between hyphal length, glomalin and aggregate

Abstract = {{There are reports that ozone in irrigation water can improve crop vigor,

   column study on the effects of ozonated irrigation water on hydraulic
   conductivity, soil hardness (aggregate strength), clay dispersion, soil
   swelling, and changes to the chemical composition of the leachate water.
   Additional batch studies were conducted to characterize the factors
   affecting the rate of ozone loss in soil/water suspensions and the
   results used in a mathematical model to predict ozone movement into a
   soil. We found that ozone increased the saturated hydraulic conductivity
   and decreased clay dispersion in a loamy soil, but not if the soil had
   an exchangeable sodium percentage >15\%. In two other soils tested, the
   ozone effects were mixed or insignificant. In every soil tested, the
   drainage water from the ozone-treated columns had lower pH's and higher
   electrolyte concentrations. This is attributed to organic matter
   oxidation and the weak acid properties of ozone. The rate of ozone
   degradation in soil water could be modeled using the total organic
   carbon content of the soil, the pH, and the soil/water ratio. Based on
   the rate of ozone loss in soil/water suspensions, the calculated depth
   of ozone penetration during the initial wetting of the soil was <2 mm,
   indicating that the reaction may be limited to the surface.}},

   43\% less in paddocks which had grown potatoes and 70\% less after a wet

   New Zealand soils}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{877-891}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing anecdotal evidence from some land treatment sites in
   New Zealand that irrigating sodium-contaminated wastewaters onto soils
   may be causing soil structural problems and reduced permeability. In
   this study, the effect of irrigating such waste (derived from
   agricultural industries) on soil physical and chemical properties was
   investigated in an Allophanic Soil (Te Puninga silt loam) and a Gley
   Soil (Waitoa silt loam). Wastewater irrigation at the sites investigated
   had taken place for the previous 5 years, with sodium adsorption ratios
   (SAR) of the wastewater varying between 17 and 51 (mmol/L)(0.5).
   Increases in exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) were recorded to 300
   mm depth in both soils. At the soil surface (0-20 mm), ESP had increased
   to 31\%, compared with 0.4\% at control sites.
   In laboratory studies using soil from the 0-20 mm layer in non-irrigated
   sites, leaching distilled water through repacked columns of the soil
   pretreated with various SAR solutions caused saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K-sat) to decrease below 100\% at SAR greater than 3.5 and
   8.5 for the Waitoa silt loam and Te Puninga silt loam, respectively. The
   decreases in K-sat coincided with an increase in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in collected leachate samples, and no dispersed clay was
   observed in the leachate. The laboratory studies would predict that
   effects of past irrigation of industrial wastewater at the study site
   would be measurable in the field due to the large ESPs that were
   recorded.
   Saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurements carried
   out at irrigated sites in the field showed no evidence of reduced
   conductivity in the surface soil until a pressure head of -120 mm was
   applied, the decrease being greater for the Te Puninga soil than the
   Waitoa. These results, along with the laboratory studies, suggest that
   whereas there may have been some structural deterioration in the soil
   matrix as a result of irrigation with the wastewater, macropore flow at
   higher moisture contents in the field was sufficient to overcome any
   adverse effects. It is suggested that laboratory studies using repacked
   soil may have limited use in predicting effects of Na-contaminated
   wastewater on soil hydraulic properties in structured soils. The results
   also further support suggestions that organic matter dissolution in
   Na-affected soils may affect soil physical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Producers in the semiarid Canadian prairies have begun to extend and
   diversify their cropping systems. These newer cropping systems are often
   considered to be more sustainable. We examine the agronomic,
   environmental, and economic effects of reducing summer fallow use and
   including grain lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) in rotation with spring
   wheat(Triticum aestivum L.). Data from a long-term crop rotation
   experiment conducted on a medium texture soil at Swift Current,
   Saskatchewan were analyzed. Four cropping systems were evaluated over
   the 1979 to 1997 period; namely, fallow-wheat (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat
   (F-W-W), continuous wheat (W), and wheat-lentil(W-l). Nitrate leaching
   below the 120 cm rooting depth of wheat was lower under continuously
   cropped systems than under fellow-based rotations, and was lowest
   overall for W-L. Wheat, whether grown on fallow or stubble, used almost
   all of the available water in the 0-120 cm depth soil profile, but
   lentil extracted about 1.5 cm less water than wheat. On average, wheat
   yield was unaffected by inclusion of lentil in the rotation; however,
   grain protein content was higher in 11 of 18 years. The incidence of
   leaf spotting diseases in wheat was lowest for wheal grown after lentil
   and highest for wheat grown on Fallow. Soil quality (soil organic
   carbon, mineralizable N and C, light fraction organic C, and water
   stable aggregates) increased with cropping intensity in the order of W-L
   greater than or equal to W > F-W-W > F-W. Although inputs of
   non-renewable energy and CO2 emissions were higher Ibr the continuous
   compared to fallow-based rotations, including lentil in the rotation
   lowered the energy requirements for N fertilizer and provided an overall
   19\%, reduction in CO2 emissions. The economics favored the W-L system
   whenever lentil price was above \$350 t(-1). The level of financial risk
   was lowest for F-W and F-W-W, intermediate for W-L. and highest for W.
   Our findings confirm the recent changes in land use practices being
   adopted by producers, and clearly show that extending and diversifying
   crop rotations by reducing fallow and including pulse crops in the
   rotation will improve the overall sustainability of agricultural
   production in this semiarid region. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Abstract = {{Bangladesh is an agricultural country. About 80\% of the total
   population live in rural areas. The contribution of agriculture to the
   gross domestic product is 30\%. Rice is the major food crop while jute,
   sugarcane and tea are the main cash crops. Other important crops are
   wheat, tobacco, pulses, vegetables and fruits. Overall productivity in
   Bangladesh is stagnating or declining. The implication of yield
   stagnation or declining productivity is severe, since these trends have
   occurred despite rapid growth in the use of chemical fertilisers.
   Depletion of soil organic matter is the main cause of low productivity,
   which is considered one of the most serious threats to the
   sustainability of agriculture in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, most soils
   have less than 17 g/kg and some soils have less than 10 g/kg organic
   matter. Farmers realise that there is a problem with soil fertility
   related to organic matter depletion. Farmers say that organic matter
   increases yield, reduces the production cost, improves crop growth and
   the economy, increases water-holding capacity and improves the soil
   structure. They recognise soil with higher organic matter content by
   darker brownish to black in colour. Some farmers are using fast-growing
   trees such as Flemingia macrophyla, Ipilipil (Leucaen leucophala),
   Glyricidia sepium, Boga Medula (Tephrosia candida), Dhol Kolmi (Ipomoea
   fistulosa), etc., as living fences, which can be used as fuel,
   fertiliser and fodder. To increase the soil organic matter, farmers use
   green manure crops, compost, quick compost, cow dung, azolla, etc.
   However, fuel for cooking purposes is limited and cow dung and crop
   residues are largely used as fuel. Crop residues are also used as fodder
   for livestock. Farmers expressed the wish to learn more about organic
   fertilizer management. However, sufficient food should be produced to
   keep pace with population growth. To alleviate the hunger and poverty is
   to increase the intensity of agricultural production and maintain
   favorable ecological conditions. Therefore, more organic matter should
   be used in the farmers' fields to sustain the soil fertility in an
   intensive farming system.}},

Abstract = {{In irrigated agriculture of arid and semiarid regions, soil salinity,
   coupled with waterlogging, is a serious problem. Provision of subsurface
   drainage seems to be a prerequisite for optimal crop production. A study
   was conducted to evaluate the long term (8-year) impact of a subsurface
   drainage system on soil properties and yields of wheat. The study was
   located in a severely affected, waterlogged, barren, sandy loam saline
   soil (Comborthids). The subsurface drainage system was installed at a
   1.75 m depth with three drain spacings (25, 50, and 75 m). The drains
   facilitated reclamation of the waterlogged saline land which had
   variations in salt removal with space and time. The removal of salts
   from the root zone varied initially with distance from the drain and
   with depth. However, after a few years, the variations were reduced and
   the land was reclaimed sufficiently to grow most of the crops of the
   region. Plots provided with a drain spacing of 75 m required more time
   for complete reclamation compared to plots provided with 25 m drain
   spacing. Leaching through subsurface drainage increased soil porosity,
   modulus of rupture, infiltration rate, organic carbon, available
   nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and available water, and decreased bulk
   density differently in the three drain spacings (20, 50, and 75 m). In
   the 75 m drain spacing plots, soil salinity and water (ECe) content
   remained higher than in the 25 and 50 m drain spacing plots. Soil and
   ECe water content were less near the drains, were highest in areas
   midway between the drains, and the effects were more apparent in the
   summer season. Wheat grain yield decreased with increasing drain
   spacings in the initial years of reclamation. With the gradual
   improvement in soil salinity, yields from plots with a 75 m spacing
   reached those of the narrower drain spacing plots by the fourth year. It
   was concluded that by installing a subsurface drainage system in a
   monsoon climate, waterlogged saline soils can be reclaimed by the
   natural leaching that can take place from rainfall. The optimum yield
   can be attained with a drain spacing of 75 m, which is 50\% more than
   the design spacing of 50 m. Faster reclamation and more yield were
   obtained with a 25 m drain spacing and was achieved at a higher cost for
   the more expensive drainage system.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are the dominant sink in the global budget of atmospheric H(2),
   and can be an important local source of atmospheric CO. In order to
   understand which soil characteristics affect the rates of H2 consumption
   and CO production, we measured these activities in 16 different soils at
   30\% and 60\% of their maximum water holding capacity (whc). The soils
   were obtained from forests, meadows and agricultural fields in Germany
   and exhibited different characteristics with respect to texture, pH,
   total C, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), respiration, total and
   inorganic N, N mineralization, nitrification, N(2)O production and NO
   turnover. The Hz consumption rate constants were generally lower at 60\%
   than at 30\% whc, whereas the CO production rates were not influenced by
   the whc. Spearman correlation analysis showed that H2 consumption
   correlated significantly (r>0.5, P<0.05) at both water contents only
   with SIR and potential nitrification. The correlation with these
   variables that are largely dominated by soil microorganisms is
   consistent with our understanding that atmospheric H2 is oxidized by
   soil hydrogenases. Multiple regression analysis and factor analysis gave
   similar results. Production of CO, on the other hand, was significantly
   correlated to soil total C, respiration, total N and NH(4)(+). The
   correlation with these variables that are largely dominated by a soil's
   chemical composition is consistent with our understanding that CO is
   produced by chemical oxidation of soil organic C. CO production was also
   influenced by soil usage, with rates increasing in the order:

Abstract = {{Long-term cultivation is known to change soil physical and chemical
   properties, but little is known about whether short-term agricultural
   practices, such as rotational grazing, can initiate such changes. This
   study investigated the impacts of 3 grazing intensities (heavy, medium,
   and light) and 4 forages on selected soil physical and chemical
   parameters of a Typic Haplustoll at Lacombe, Alberta. Measurements were
   conducted on soil samples collected at the beginning (1993) and the end
   (1996) of the study. Two perennial forages, smooth bromegrass (Bromus
   inermis cv. `Carlton') and meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius cv.
   `Paddock'), and 2 annuals, a mixture of triticale (X Triticosecale
   Wittmack cv. `Pika') and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. LAC Lacombe')
   and triticale alone were used for the study. Grazing intensity or forage
   species did not affect carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Grazing intensity
   influenced changes in available water holding capacity for the 0-5 cm
   interval, soil nitrogen for the 30-45 cm interval, soil pH for the 5-15
   cm interval and electrical conductivity for all depth intervals except
   for the 0-5 cm interval (P less than or equal to 0.05). Forage species
   affected changes in soil carbon in the 0-5 cm interval, soil pH between
   0 and 15 cm, and electrical conductivity between 5 and 45 cm (P less
   than or equal to 0.05). Soil electrical conductivities for all grazing
   levels and forage treatments were within the range (i.e. 0-2 dS m(-1))
   considered to have negligible effects on plant growth. The minimal
   effects of grazing and plant species on soil parameters in this study
   may have been due to the resilient intrinsic properties of the sail
   and/or the short study length.}},

   investigated the effects of deep-burrowing earthworm species on soil
   structure at the surface of chisel-plowed or ridge-tilled cropping
   systems in Pike County, OH, planted to corn (Zea mays L.). Earthworm
   populations were experimentally manipulated in field enclosures by
   adding predominantly deep-burrowing Lumbricus terrestris L., or leaving
   enclosures unmodified in each tillage system. In 1995, after 2 years of
   hi-annual additions, we measured surface residue cover, dry sieved
   aggregates (DSA)- and water-stable aggregates (WSA), and carbon and
   nitrogen concentration of aggregates by size class, in each treatment
   combination. Also, in 1998, we used tension infiltrometry to examine
   crusting effects at the soil surface among earthworm treatments in the
   chisel-plow treatment. Earthworm additions yielded increased density and
   biomass of L. terrestris than ambient controls, and to a greater extent
   in the ridged corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Mess.)wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.) (CSW) than corn-soybean (CS) rotation. Percentage residue
   cover in CS cropping decreased with earthworm additions. Earthworm
   additions decreased the geometric mean weight diameter (GMWD) of DSA and
   WSA in chisel-plow treatment compared to no additions. Earthworm
   additions influenced carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios for smaller DSA and
   WSA. Water-stable aggregate C/N decreased with size class. The overall
   effect of earthworm additions was an increase in deep-burrowing
   earthworms, a decrease in surface residue cover, and more pronounced
   crusting, which decreased mesopore conductivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{147-163}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Crop-based agriculture occupies 1.7 billion hectares, globally, with a
   soil C stock of about 170 Pg. Of the past anthropogenic CO2 additions to
   the atmosphere, about 50 Pg C came from the loss of soil organic matter
   (SOM) in cultivated soils. Improved management practices, however, can
   rebuild C stocks in agricultural soils and help mitigate CO2 emissions.
   Increasing soil C stocks requires increasing C inputs and/or reducing
   soil heterotrophic respiration. Management options that contribute to
   reduced soil respiration include reduced tillage practices (especially
   no-till) and increased cropping intensity. Physical disturbance
   associated with intensive soil tillage increases the turnover of soil
   aggregates and accelerates the decomposition of aggregate-associated
   SOM. No-till increases aggregate stability and promotes the formation of
   recalcitrant SOM fractions within stabilized micro- and macroaggregate
   structures. Experiments using C-13 natural abundance show up to a
   two-fold increase in mean residence time of SOM under no-till vs
   intensive tillage. Greater cropping intensity, i.e., by reducing the
   frequency of bare fallow in crop rotations and increasing the use of
   perennial vegetation, can increase water and nutrient use efficiency by
   plants, thereby increasing C inputs to soil and reducing organic matter
   decomposition rates.
   Management and policies to sequester C in soils need to consider that:
   soils have a finite capacity to store C, gains in soil C can be reversed
   if proper management is not maintained, and fossil fuel inputs for
   different management practices need to be factored into a total
   agricultural CO2 balance.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of root and soil respiration are becoming increasingly
   important in agricultural and ecological research, but there is little
   understanding how soil texture and water content may affect these
   estimates. We examined the effects of soil texture on (i) estimated
   rates of root and soil respiration and (ii) soil CO2 concentrations,
   during cycles of soil wetting and drying in the citrus rootstock,
   Volkamer lemon (Citrus volkameriana Tan. and Pasq.). Plants were grown
   in soil columns filled with three different soil mixtures varying in
   their sand, silt and clay content. Root and soil respiration rates, soil
   water content, plant water uptake and soil CO2 concentrations were
   measured and dynamic relationships among these variables were developed
   for each soil texture treatment. We found that although the different
   soil textures differed in their plant-soil water relations
   characteristics, plant growth was only slightly affected. Root and soil
   respiration rates were similar under most soil moisture conditions for
   soils varying widely in percentages of sand, silt and clay. Only
   following irrigation did CO2 efflux from the soil surface vary among
   soils. That is, efflux of CO2 from the soil surface was much more
   restricted after watering (therefore rendering any respiration
   measurements inaccurate) in finer textured soils than in sandy soils
   because of reduced porosity in the finer textured soils. Accordingly,
   CO2 reached and maintained the highest concentrations in finer textured
   soils (> 40 mmol CO2 mol(-1)). This study revealed that changes in soil
   moisture can affect interpretations of root and soil measurements based
   on CO2 efflux, particularly in fine textured soils. The implications of
   the present findings for field soil CO2 flux measurements are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural management practices have been shown to influence the
   decomposer community in soils, with no-tillage (NT) systems favoring
   fungi as compared with conventional tillage (CT) systems. In this study,
   we examined six North American agroecosystems with respect to the
   effects of NT vs. CT management systems on the accrual of microbial
   cell-wall residues in surface soil. We used total amino sugar contents
   to estimate living and decomposing microbial cell-wall mass in soil and
   the contents of glucosamine and muramic acid to separate fungal and
   bacterial contributions to microbial-derived soil organic matter (SOM).
   Compared with estimates of glucosamine and muramic acid present in
   living biomass of fungi and bacteria, total concentrations of these
   compounds (745-2076 mg glucosamine kg(-1) soil and 37-79 mg muramic acid
   kg(-1) soil) were larger by factors of 54 to 745 and 26 to 82,
   respectively. At three sites, the ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid
   in NT soils (32.0, 30.0, 42.2) significantly exceeded those in the
   respective CT soils (18.8, 22.1, 23.0) because of a higher enrichment of
   glucosamine. This coincided with higher values for fungal biomass,
   particulate organic matter carbon (POMC), mean weight diameter of
   water-stable aggregates (MWD), and total organic carbon (TOC). Analysis
   of aggregate-size classes showed that the additional glucosamine
   accumulated in >53-mm aggregates but not in smaller particles. The
   enrichment of SOM in fungal-derived glucosamine suggests that the
   accrual of hyphal cell-wall residues is an important process in the
   three NT agroecosystems which leads to higher SOM storage in surface
   soil concurrent with an increase in aggregate stability. The other
   soils, having a lower clay plus silt content, exhibited no significant
   differences in POM-C, MWD, and total amino sugars between NT and CT
   management systems. We suggest that at lower clay plus silt contents the
   beneficial potential for NT to sequester microbial-derived SOM is lower
   because of limited physical stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{De-inking paper sludge (DPS) has been traditionally disposed of by

   incorporation on organic matter and aggregation of a clay loam (Typic
   Dystrochrept) and a silty clay loam (Typic Humaquept), Whole soil C,
   particulate (>53 mu m) and light fraction (density <1.8 Mg m(-3)) C, and
   mater-stable aggregation were measured periodically during a 3-yr period
   after a single application of DPS at rates of 0 (control), 50, and 100
   Mg ha(-1). Microscopic observations of water-stable aggregates were also
   performed. Adding DPS increased whole soil C content, which remained
   greater than in the control for the duration of the study. After 2 yr,
   about 40\% of the initial material remained in the soil, The proportion
   of residual C attributed to DPS and present in the particulate fraction
   remained constant at 70 to 90\% during the first 2 yr of the study,
   whereas the proportion of residual C present in the light fraction
   decreased from >95\% for fresh DPS to <50\% after 2 yr, One year after
   incorporation of DPS, the proportion of water-stable aggregates >1 mm
   was 2 to 6 times larger in amended soils than in the control. This
   effect was still statistically significant after 3 Sr. Microscopic
   observations revealed that DPS formed into clusters of wood fibers which
   became encrusted with mineral particles. We hypothesized that this
   encrustation provided physical protection to the decaying DPS which
   remained particulate (>53 pm) in size and progressively densified to
   >1.8 Mg m(-3). As a result, water-stable macroaggregates were formed

   relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil
   moisture and with rainfall, In spite of varying amounts of organic
   substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce
   substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide
   variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots
   were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually
   produced an increase both in N(2)O emissions due to denitrification and
   in direct N(2)O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50\% of those
   due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N(2)O-N occurred in the
   first month following fertilizer administration. N(2)O emissions due to
   denitrification were highest in the days immediately following the
   administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N(2)O
   emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N(2)O emission
   via nitrification differed from N(2)O losses via denitrification which,
   under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole

Abstract = {{Microbial community composition may be an important determinant of soil

   long-term tillage comparison experiments located along two climatic
   gradients to examine the effects of no-tillage (NT) and conventional
   tillage (CT) management on bacterial and fungal abundance and biomass
   and to examine potential controls on the relative abundances of bacteria
   and fungi in these two systems. Samples were divided into 0-5 and 5-20
   cm depth increments and analyzed for bacterial and fungal abundance and
   biomass, total C and N, particulate organic matter C and N (POM-C and
   N), soil water content, texture, pH, and water-stable aggregate
   distributions. Soil moisture, which varied by tillage treatment and
   geographically with climate, ranged from 0.05 to 0.35 g g(-1) dry soil
   in the surface 0-5 cm and 0.15 to 0.28 g g(-1) dry soil at 5-20 cm.
   Measured organic matter C and N fractions and mean weight diameter (MWD)
   of water-stable aggregates were significantly higher in NT relative to
   CT at three of the six sites. Fungal hyphal length ranged from 19 to 292
   m g(-1) soil and was 1.9 to 2.5 times higher in NT compared to CT
   surface soil across all sites. Few significant tillage treatment
   differences in soil physical and chemical properties or in fungal
   abundance and biomass were observed at 5-20 cm. Bacterial abundance and
   biomass were not consistently influenced by tillage treatment or site
   location at either depth. The proportion of the total biomass composed
   of fungi ranged from 10 to 60\% and was significantly higher in NT
   compared to CT surface soil at five of six sites. Proportional fungal
   biomass was not strongly related to soil texture, pH, aggregation, or
   organic C and N fractions, but was positively related to soil moisture
   (r = 0.67; P < 0.001). The relationship between soil moisture and the
   degree of fungal dominance was due to the positive response of fungal
   biomass and the lack of response of bacterial biomass to increasing soil
   moisture across the range of measured soil water contents. Tillage
   treatment effects on fungal biomass and proportional fungal abundance
   were not significant when the data were analyzed by analysis of
   covariance with soil moisture as the covariate. These results suggest
   that observed tillage treatment and climate gradient effects on fungi
   are related to differences in soil moisture. Further research is needed,
   however, to determine how tillage-induced changes in the soil
   environment shape microbial community composition in agroecosystems. (C)

   textural composition of the Ekebo profile was almost uniform, with 19\%
   clay, 36\% silt (2-60 mu m) and 45\% sand, on average, but an increasing
   content of stones and gravel up to 15\% with depth. Amounts of carbon

   Ap-horizon, respectively, and the subsoil to 1 m contained 34 t C ha(-1)
   and 3.3 t N ha(-1) The sum of cations amounted to 8.7 cmol(c) kg(-1)
   soil in the Ap-horizon and 6.8 in the subsoil, The main clay minerals in
   the Ekebo soil were mixed-layer minerals showing concentrations of
   25-39\% throughout the profile, followed by illite, 19-31\%. Vermiculite
   amounted to 2-7\% and kaolinite to 2-5\% while chlorite was only present

   consisted of a thick very greyish brown A-horizon over a subsoil with

   texture was a sandy loam with 10-20\% clay. The bulk density increased
   with depth from 1.60 to 1.87 kg dm(-3). Carbon and nitrogen present in
   the Ap-horizon amounted to 61 t C ha(-1) and 6.2 t N ha(-1), and 30 t C
   ha(-1) and 3.8 t N ha(-1) were found in the subsoil. The cation-exchange
   capacity amounted to 12.1 cmol(c) kg(-1) soil in the Ap-horizon and was
   somewhat lower in the subsoil. The clay mineralogy was as follows. The
   content of mixed-layer minerals was higher than that of illite in the
   top and upper subsoil. Vermiculite amounted to 6-10\%, chlorite to 2\%
   and kaolinite to about 1\% in the profile. Although both soils ended up
   as Hapludolls in the classification, there are differences in
   productivity. Fjardingslov produces somewhat higher yields. Owing to the
   fact that several Swedish agricultural soils are classified as Mollisols
   but their character is more similar to Inceptisols, a revision of the
   required characteristics for a mollic epipedon is discussed.}},

   of adverse chemical and physical properties, conceptually consistent
   with the low and variable millet yields. The variability also implies
   that soil characterization depends on the design of soil sampling, that
   average values are of doubtful use, that application of chemical
   fertilizers will produce very different results, and that there is no
   general scheme for correcting soil fertility. The application of
   livestock manure will continue to be the best strategy for sustaining
   soil productivity.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{603-622}},
Abstract = {{Attributes of 25 Tasmanian ferrosols under 5 forms of management
   (low-input pasture, high-input pasture, intermittent cropping,
   continuous cropping, and pyrethrum production) were assessed using field
   and laboratory techniques, to see how these attributes changed as the
   intensity of land management increased. Among the most notable changes
   were soil organic carbon (C) in the top 150 mm, which was about 30\%
   less in cropping and pyrethrum paddocks than pasture paddocks, and
   microbial biomass C, which was about 60\% less. Earthworm numbers showed
   even greater differences, with virtually no earthworms under pyrethrum.
   Pasture soils had higher shear strength and water contents at the liquid
   limit in the top 150 mm, and more water-stable aggregates in the
   subsurface soil. Despite these differences, the absolute values of most
   attributes in cropping paddocks were of a magnitude, which suggests that
   Tasmanian ferrosols even under continuous cropping are still in good
   condition. This agreed with the views of the farmers, obtained by
   individual survey. The decrease in organic C in the cropped soils has
   not decreased the effective cation exchange capacity, probably because
   their higher pH due to liming has compensated. Because ferrosols with
   organic C contents of 1-2\% elsewhere in Australia have been shown to
   have serious management limitations, we need to know by how much the
   organic C contents in Tasmanian ferrosols will continue to decrease
   under intensive cropping to predict whether they might surer in a
   similar way.}},

   significantly higher in CRP than cropland samples, but differences in
   North Dakota were not significant. In all states, microbial biomass

   sites. Nitrate-N was 18 to 74\% higher in cropland than CRP sites. Soil
   respiration values were greater (but not significantly different) in CRP
   than cropland sites in all four states. Hyphal length, measured only in
   Iowa, increased 26 to 62\% under CRP. CRP samples had higher ergosterol
   only in Henry County, Iowa, where cropland was chisel plowed and disced
   each year. Overall, soil biological indicators showed more significant
   differences than either chemical or physical indicators. This
   multi-state project shows that several soil quality indicators were

Abstract = {{Intensive rural industry is developing rapidly in parts of inland
   Australia. The usually nutrient and salt rich effluent from these
   sources has traditionally been disposed to both land and water bodies.
   Since direct water discharge is no longer permitted, a challenge now
   exists when applying effluent to land especially where the rate of
   application exceeds crop requirements. Effluent of high volume and
   concentration of nutrients and/or salts can easily contaminate land and
   water resources. Predicting the optimum rate of land application of
   effluent is complicated by the physical, chemical and biological
   properties of soils.
   This paper addresses the characteristics of effluents from various
   intensive rural industries and their potential environmental impacts
   when irrigated to agricultural land in New South Wales, Australia. To
   assess the environmental sustainability of effluent reuse in land
   application, a mathematical model (ERIM) has been developed based on a
   monthly water balance. ERIM includes historical rainfall and
   evaporation; the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus introduced; their
   yearly removal by plants to be grown; amount of applied organic matter;
   and water holding capacity of soil. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The estimation of gas exchanges with the soil is important when
   assessing gas emission to the atmospheric environment or gas consumption
   by the soil. This estimation often requires the measurement of the
   diffusion coefficient of the investigated gas. The aim of this study was
   to develop an experimental method creating Limited soil disturbance and
   based on simple calculation procedures to determine the diffusion
   coefficient, D(s), for N(2)O in soils, This objective was achieved using
   a N(2)O mass now meter that supplied a continuous and constant now of
   gas from below the soil surface until a steady-state N(2)O concentration
   gradient with depth was obtained, The coefficients of diffusion were
   calculated daily for 6 d, under steady-state concentration gradient,
   using Fick's first law. The mean value of the diffusion coefficient for
   N(2)O was 1.26 x 10(-6) m(2) s(-1) (CV = 25\%) at 0.16 m(3) m(-3) of
   air-filled porosity. This value was validated by a transient-state
   laboratory method using soil cores and compared with empirical
   estimations of D(s) from air-filled porosity determinations. The typo
   experimental methods produced similar values for D(s) and both provided
   more accurate estimates than the empirical models. The proposed method
   can be applied to other gases provided an empirical model relating D(s)
   to D(o) (gas diffusivity in free air) is first established. A
   theoretical study identified the threshold air-filled porosity values
   below which the flux density must be adjusted to maintain the validity
   of the D(s) calculations.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses a well-established water balance methodology, the
   Thornthwaite-Mather approach, to evaluate the effects of soil water
   holding capacity assumptions on estimates of African evapotranspiration
   rates, moisture deficit, and moisture surplus conditions. Under constant
   climate conditions, the model tests the impact of using a constant 150
   mm soil water holding capacity compared to using a newly derived soil
   water holding capacity data set (the Dunne-Willmott data set). The study
   also uses a worldwide survey of soil degradation between 1950 and 1980
   (GLASOD: Global Assessment of Soil Degradation) to evaluate the impacts
   of human-induced soil degradation on local water balances. The GLASOD
   data are used to alter local soil water holding capacities based on the
   Dunne-Willmott data to simulate human soil degradation patterns in
   Africa. Results indicate that the use of simplified soil water holding
   capacities can lead to significant errors in estimated
   evapotranspiration rates and water surplus and deficit conditions in
   Africa. Regions most affected are those with seasonal wet and dry
   climates, which are also those locations with the greatest climate
   variability. Because these are often the climates most studied to detect
   and model environmental change, it is important that accurate soil
   moisture estimates be used to simulate climate conditions in these
   regions. Results also indicate that soil degradation occurring over a 30
   yr period (1950 to 1980) has had a significant impact on local water
   resources. The greatest impacts of these changes are in some of the more
   productive agricultural areas in the wetter sub-humid climates. Changes
   include increased runoff during wet seasons and an extended drought
   period during the dry seasons. Given that these agricultural systems
   have less flexibility to respond to long-term desiccation as compared to
   pastoral systems, this could lead to significant changes in local
   growing seasons and perhaps overall productivity in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification in riparian soils is thought to be an important factor
   that reduces hydrologic export of nitrate from forested and agricultural
   catchments. A 2-y study to identify the soil factors most closely
   associated with denitrification in riparian soils in headwater
   catchments within the Catskill Mountains of New York, included held
   surveys of surface and subsurface denitrification rates, and an
   amendment experiment to assess the relative effects of increases in
   available carbon and substrate NO3- on denitrification rates.
   Denitrification rates were measured by acetylene inhibition during
   incubation of intact soil cores from eight soil types representing a
   range of drainage classes. Soil cores were analyzed for organic matter,
   total P, extractable NO3--N and NH4+-N, organic N, pH, moisture,
   porosity, and water-filled pore space, to determine which of these
   factors were most closely associated with denitrification. The
   distribution of denitrification rates found during the field surveys was
   highly skewed, with many low or zero values and few high values.
   Denitrification rates were positively associated with high soil organic
   matter, total P, and water-filled pore space, and were highest in seep
   (poorly-drained) soils, toeslope (seasonally-drained) soils, and
   stream-edge (poorly- to moderately well-drained) soils in which these
   three soil characteristics were typically high. Denitrification rates in
   these wet locations were also positively associated with soil NH4+-N
   concentration and pH, bur not with NO3--N concentration, suggesting that
   the rate of NO3- supply (via nitrification or hydrologic transport) was
   more important than the instantaneous concentration of NO3--N in the
   soils. The amendment experiment indicated that denitrification in soil
   types studied was most responsive to added glucose alone or with NO;.
   Thus, in these soils, a combination of slow rates of NO3- supply and low
   available carbon appears to limit denitrification. Annual
   denitrification rates in spring-fed soils (0.74 to 1.43 kg N ha(-1)
   y(-1)) were up to 5 times greater than in other surface soils, yet these
   soils accounted for only 1.8\% of the catchment's N loss through
   denitrification because they represent less than 3\% of the catchment
   area. Dry upland soils constituted 71\% of the catchment area and
   accounted for 91\% of the catchment's N loss through denitrification.
   Annual denitrification in the catchment equaled about 65\% of stream
   NO3--N and NH4+-N export and 14\% of precipitation NO3--N and NH4+-N
   inputs. Denitrification appears to be important relative to N input and
   export in these Catskill catchments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Despite a relatively high organic matter content, the heavy soils of the
   St-Lawrence lowlands of eastern Canada are susceptible to structural
   degradation in the form of compaction, surface crusting and sheet
   erosion. The resistance of these soil to degradation is largely
   controlled by the presence of stable macroaggregates. Several agronomic
   studies involving various combinations of management options such as
   organic additions, crop rotations and reduced tillage have allowed to
   intensively monitor the changes in aggregation of these soils through
   time. The proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (>1 mm) showed
   large temporal variation. Short-range variations (days or weeks) were
   attributable to climatic conditions and tillage operations as revealed
   by significant correlations between soil water content and aggregation
   within a growing season. Longer-term trends (>2 years) were a function
   mostly of carbon (C) management i.e. placement or location of the
   residues in the soil profile, and the amount and quality of the
   residues. The effect of C management was reflected by correlations
   between aggregation, C inputs, soil C content and organic matter (OM)
   fractions. Based on a study of the OM associated with the primary
   particles it is proposed that the clay and silt particles of these soils
   are relatively saturated in OM which leads to highly stable
   microaggregation. Any additional OM accumulation in the surface soil
   provided by reduced- or no-till conditions, perennial forage crops or
   manure additions would lead to increased macroaggregation and be related
   to the accumulation of particulate OM. This hypothesis helps to explain
   the relatively high responsiveness of soil structure, and in particular
   stable macroaggregation, to changes in cropping systems in these soils.

   and lowered water-holding capacity, organic C, total N, and N
   mineralization compared with soil in a forested site. Soil organic N
   fractions, including microbial biomass N and particulate organic matter
   N, were reduced by the mixing effects of tillage in the cultivated site.
   Initial clearing of vegetation increased hulk density and pH but did not
   decrease soil organic C and N compared with the forest site. Soil at an
   agricultural site that had been abandoned for an Il-Jr period did not
   return to levels of organic C, total N, and N mineralization observed in
   the forest and cleared sites. These results suggest that long-term
   tillage has a significant impact on soil properties in this tropical
   island environment, including reducing active and stable N pools.
   However, the significance of these changes on NO3- leaching is unclear
   because of alterations in soil properties affecting both soil water
   movement and other N processes.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript reviews the potential impact of residue management,
   conservation tillage and soil restoration on carbon sequestration in
   world soils. The greenhouse effect is among four principal ecological
   issues of global concern that include: (i) adequacy of land resources to
   meet needs of present and future generations; (ii) role of world soils
   and agricultural practices in the `greenhouse' effect; (iii) potential
   of crop residue management, restoration of degraded soils, and
   conservation tillage in carbon sequestration in soil; and (iv)
   minimizing risks of soil degradation by enhancing soil resilience and
   soil quality. Annual increase in CO, concentration in the atmosphere is
   3.2 x 10(15) g, and there exists a potential to mitigate this effect
   through C sequestration in soils. Just as world soils are an important
   active pool of organic carbon and play a major role in the global carbon
   cycle, crop residue is a major renewable resource which also has an
   important impact on the global carbon cycle. I have estimated the annual
   production of crop residue to be about 3.4 billion Mg in the world. If
   15\% of C contained in the residue can be converted to passive soil
   organic carbon (SOC) fraction, it may lead to C sequestration at the
   rate of 0.2 x 10(15) g/yr. Similarly restoring presently degraded soils,
   estimated at about 2.0 billion ha, and increasing SOC content by
   0.01\%/yr may lead C sequestration at the rate of 3.0 Pg C/yr.
   Conservation tillage is an important tool for crop residue management,
   restoration of degraded soil, and for enhancing C sequestration in soil.
   Conservation tillage, any tillage system that maintains at least 30\% of
   the soil surface covered by residue, was practised in 1995 on about 40 x
   10(6) ha or 35.5\% of planted area in USA. It is projected that by the
   year 2020, conservation tillage may be adopted on 75\% of cropland in
   USA (140 x 10(6) ha), 50\% in other developed countries (225 x 10(6)
   ha), and 25\% in developing countries (172 x 10(6) ha). The projected
   conversion of conventional to conservation tillage may lead to a global
   C sequestration by 2020 at a low estimate of 1.5 x 10(15) g, and at a
   high estimate of 4.9 x 10(15) g of C. These potentials of C
   sequestration can be realized through adoption of regional, national and
   global soil policy that stipulate appropriate use of world soil
   resources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of atmospheric methane in soils was measured in situ at a
   selection of sites in northern Europe, mainly under forest but also
   under moorland and agricultural arable land and grassland. Our objective
   was to examine how land use, soil type, and location affected methane
   oxidation through their impact on gas diffusivity and air permeability.
   Gas diffusivity at the soil surface and, in some cases, after removal of
   any surface organic layer was measured in situ using Freon-22 tracer in
   a portable probe. For about half of the sites, gas diffusivity was also
   measured in intact topsoil core samples in the laboratory using krypton
   85. Air permeability and porosity were also measured on these cores.
   Although the method of measurement of CH4 oxidation varied between
   sites, the same techniques were used to measure soil physical properties
   at all sites. CH4 oxidation rates ranged from 0 to 2.5 mg m(-2) d.
   Diffusivity also covered a very wide range, being lowest in loam cores
   from wet grassland in Norway and highest in relatively dry, sandy soils
   in Denmark and Scotland. CH4 oxidation tended to increase with gas
   diffusivity measured in situ at the soil surface, though the
   relationship was poor at high diffusivities, presumably because CH4
   oxidation was not limited by diffusion. Removal of the surface organic
   layer reduced in situ diffusivity at the surface and improved its
   relationship with CH4 oxidation rate. Sites where soils had
   well-developed structure and a loose and permeable organic layer at the
   surface tended to have the highest CH4 oxidation rates. Core
   measurements, particularly of air permeability, could not be obtained at
   some sites owing to the inability to take suitable samples. Diffusivity
   measured in cores generally decreased with increasing depth of sampling
   in the topsoil, with the 50- to 100-mm depth giving the best correlation
   with CH4 uptake; cores from within this layer also gave the highest CH4
   oxidation during laboratory incubation. Effective comparisons between
   sites were hampered by the differing responses of CH4 oxidation and
   diffusivity to soil properties. However, multivariate cluster analysis
   that included the above transport variables plus others relevant to CH4
   oxidation (namely, soil texture; bulk density; air-filled porosity; pH;
   carbon, nitrogen, and water contents; presence and depth of organic
   layers; and N deposition) confirmed the importance of soil water
   content, structure and texture in distinguishing different soil and site
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Organic amendments used to enrich soils of low organic matter contents
   can affect sorption and movement of pesticides in soils. In this work,
   we studied the effect of olive oil mill wastewater (OOW) soil amendment
   on soil porosity and on leaching of the herbicides clopyralid
   (3,6-dichloropicolinic acid) and metamitron
   (4-amino-3-methyl-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one) in clay soil
   columns. OOW amendment resulted in an increase in the organic carbon
   content of the soils and a reduction in soil porosity, the latter
   confirmed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) studies. MIP and SEM data showed the reduction in
   porosity is basically due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 0.1
   mu m) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 0.1 mu m).
   These changes in porosity are produced by the combined effect of the
   suspended and soluble organic matter and salts in the OOW and the
   solubilization-insolubilization of the soil carbonate minerals promoted
   by OOW. Soil columns were handpacked with the unamended clay soil and
   with the same soil which had been treated for 3 yrs with two different
   doses of OOW (low dose: 300 ml/m(2) a year and high dose: 600 ml/m(2) a
   year). Clopyralid moved more rapidly than metamitron in the unamended
   soil due to greater sorption and degradation of metamitron. Total
   amounts of clopyralid leached from the OOW amended soils were
   significantly reduced (75 and 25\% for the lower and higher dose,
   respectively) when compared with the unamended soil (100\%), whereas
   metamitron did not leach at all from the amended soils. Sorption and
   degradation studies with soil slurry suggested this reduction may be
   mainly due to an increase in sorption and degradation processes in
   amended soils, as a consequence of the increase in the organic carbon
   content. However the decrease in mobility produced by OOW amendment is
   greater than that suggested from the sorption and degradation increases.
   The reduction in large size conducting pores and the increase in the
   small non-conducting pens, induced by OOW amendment, produce an increase
   in the residence time of the herbicides in the immobile water phase,
   enhancing diffusion, sorption and degradation processes, thereby
   retarding mobility. The retarding effect was more pronounced for
   metamitron than for clopyralid due to the higher sorptivity and
   degradability of the former herbicide. These results suggest the
   possible use of the OOW or similar wastewater amendment in reducing the
   contamination of groundwater by pesticide drainage. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of physical properties that significantly
   influence the fate of water and solute in soils needs a large number of
   measurements to be quantified. Surface electrical resistivity techniques
   could be used as a simple and practical method to determine this spatial
   variability. Electrical sounding and profiling measurements were taken
   on a small agricultural field (30 by 60 m) under two different soil
   conditions (dry and wet conditions). The soil profile is composed of
   three layers: a highly permeable sandy loam (alluvial terrace) overlying
   a gravelly sandy till that covers a friable sandy to silty shale. The
   soil physical properties (grain size distribution, porosity, hydraulic
   conductivity, bulk density, and organic matter content) of the uppermost
   layer were measured in the laboratory on undisturbed soil cores taken at
   three different depths on a 6 by 15 m grid in the field. Correlations
   were established between these parameters and the electrical
   conductivity. The best correlations were between the electrical
   conductivity and the sand, silt, clay, and organic matter contents.
   Their correlation coefficients, r, were, respectively; 0.64, 0.53, 0.64,
   and 0.65 for the dry conditions and 0.54, 0.45, 0.53, and 0.52 for the
   wet conditions. No relation was established between the electrical
   conductivity and the porosity, the bulk density, or the hydraulic
   conductivity. The correlation coefficients were, respectively, 0.04,
   0.16, and 0.10 for the dry conditions and 0.14, 0.12, and 0.14 for the
   wet conditions. Electrical conductivity seems to be more influenced by
   the soil texture, i.e., by the electrical properties of the soil
   constituents, than by the structure, i.e., the water-related properties.
   Besides, the two sets of electrical resistivities obtained in dry and
   wet conditions are not significantly different, as shown by the
   regression between them (slope = 0.92, r = 0.71) and by the
   isoresistivity maps. This study seems to indicate that the electrical
   method could be used to evaluate the spatial variability of some soil
   properties when their variability is sufficiently large, i.e., when the
   investigation scale or the level of contrast is large enough.}},

Abstract = {{Different agricultural practices can result in a decline in soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and a consequent reduction in soil structural stability.
   Experiments were conducted on soils with a range of SOC values, to
   quantify the destabilizing effects of increased tillage intensity.
   Different tillage intensity was simulated with the use of a falling
   weight, where specific energy levels, similar to those experienced
   during tillage, were reproduced. The level of destabilization was
   assessed by the quantity of mechanically dispersed clay (using a
   turbidimetric technique) and the quantity of water-stable aggregates
   (WSA) > 0.25 mm remaining after being shaken in water.
   The quantity of clay dispersed increased with increasing water content,
   in the absence of any mechanical pretreatment, the rate of increase
   rising sharply with declining SOC. Following simulated tillage, and at
   water contents above the plastic Limit, clay dispersion increased in
   proportion to the energy of disruption, and also increased with
   decreasing SOC levels. Below the plastic limit all the soils were
   relatively insensitive to mechanical disruption. A simple empirical
   model was derived to link clay dispersion to SOC, water content and
   energy of disruption.
   The proportion of WSA declined sharply with decreasing SOC, and to a
   lesser extent following tillage. The quantity of WSA following simulated
   intensive tillage (300 J kg(-1)) of grassland (SOC, 2.8-3.2 g (100
   g)(-1)) was greater than that present, prior to tillage from fallow,
   arable and arable/ley rotation treatments (SOC 1.1-2.5 g (100 g)(-1)).
   Aggregate tensile strength was found to be relatively insensitive to
   differences in SOC. However, variations of strength within treatments,
   an indicator of soil friability, increased in proportion with SOC. A
   turbidity index was derived in which the turbidity of natural and
   remoulded aggregates was compared. Variation of this index with
   increasing mechanical energy is used as an indicator of the sensitivity
   of soils to damage during tillage. A visual representation is
   constructed to Link the sensitivity of soils to damage during tillage
   with both SOC and water potential. These experiments illustrate that
   management practices, which lead to a long term reduction in SOC, are
   responsible for an increase: in aggregate strength and reduction in
   stability plus an increase in sensitivity of soils to structural decline
   following subsequent tillage. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria differ in their abilities to degrade hydrophobic xenobiotic
   compounds which are associated with solid sorbents and nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) in the environment. Here, we assess the bioavailability
   of naphthalene sorbed to forest soils, river sediment, and a variety of
   synthetic sorbents to two bacterial species studied previously using
   agricultural soils as sorbents. Using a mineralization kinetics
   approach, we determined that, for an Alcaligenes sp. (strain NP-Alk),
   sorbed naphthalene was unavailable for degradation and slow desorption
   limited the extent of mineralization in all sorbent systems. Pseudomonas
   putida strain 17484 had direct and immediate access to a portion of the
   sorbed naphthalene associated with all natural sorbents and facilitated
   the desorption of additional naphthalene for degradation. Naphthalene
   associated with forest soils was less available than naphthalene sorbed
   to agricultural soils or river sediments. Aging soil-naphthalene
   slurries (up to 3 yr equilibration) progressively diminished both the
   rate and extent of naphthalene degradation by strain 17484. Exposure of
   soil interior sorption sites by sonication of 3 yr old slurries
   increased naphthalene availability to this organism. Differential access
   to surface-sorbed naphthalene in soil studies, due to the attachment
   propensities of the two organisms, accounted for the observed
   bioavailability results. Sorption to granular activated carbon (GAC)
   virtually precluded naphthalene degradation by either organism, whereas
   naphthalene sorbed to XAD-2 resin, hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   (HDTMA)-modified smectite and Tenax was more rapidly desorbed and

   plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands
   converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63
   were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were
   related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84
   to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and
   WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive
   relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist
   erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs,
   they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby
   reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential
   for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage
   retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance
   surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in
   this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important
   also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls
   such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils. (C) 1997 Published by

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine how rangeland hydrology of
   oak, juniper, bunchgrass and shortgrass vegetation types is altered by
   fire. The research was conducted at the Sonora Agricultural Experiment
   Station on the Edwards Plateau, Texas. Infiltration rate and interrill
   erosion were measured using a drip-type rainfall simulator. Terminal
   infiltration rates of unburned areas were significantly greater on sites
   dominated by oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.) (200 mm hour(-1)) or juniper
   (Juniperus ashei Buchh.) (183 mm hour(-1)) than on sites dominated by
   bunchgrass (146 mm hour(-1)) or shortgrass (105 mm hour(-1)). Terminal
   infiltration rates on burned areas were significantly reduced on sites
   dominated by bunchgrass (110 mm hour(-1)), shortgrass (76 mm hour(-1)),
   and on oak sites that were cut and burned (129 mm hour(-1)). Soil
   organic matter content (r = .61), total organic cover (r = .59), and
   aggregate stability (r = .53) were the variables most strongly
   correlated with infiltration rate. Measured soil structure properties
   were not altered by fire, therefore, differences in infiltration rate
   between unburned and burned treatments were attributable to variations
   in the amount of cover. The terminal infiltration rate of cut and burned
   juniper sites (162 mm hour(-1)) was not changed significantly after the
   fire because the associated good soil structure properties allowed rapid
   infiltration even after cover was removed. Good soil structure
   properties were also present on the oak sites, but the infiltration rate
   significantly decreased as a result of the temporary hydrophobic nature
   of the soil on this site after burning. Prior to burning, interrill
   erosion was much lower under the tree sites (oak = 2 kg ha(-1); juniper
   = 34 kg ha(-1)) than on bunchgrass (300 kg ha(-1)) or shortgrass (1,299
   kg ha(-1) sites. After burning, interrill erosion significantly
   increased for all vegetation types (shortgrass = 5,766 kg ha(-1);
   bunchgrass = 4,463 kg ha(-1); oak = 4,500 kg ha(-1); juniper = 1,926 kg
   ha(-1)). Total organic cover (r = -.74) and bulk density at 0-30 mm (r =
   .46) were most strongly correlated with interrill erosion.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade there has been increasing scientific interest in
   organic farming, especially in comparison with commercial agriculture.
   Although many comparative studies involving these two agricultural
   systems have been undertaken, few assess the impact of these two
   fundamentally differing systems on soil structure, and none on soil
   microstructure. In this study, two adjacent, paired farms in eastern
   Iowa, one managed according to organic, and the other according to
   conventional, farming methods, were studied to determine the effects of
   these two agricultural systems on soil structure and microstructure. At
   both farms colour, texture, ped type and degree of development, depth of
   the A horizon and porosity were described in the field, organic matter
   content was determined, and microstructural and organic characteristics
   were described using micromorphology. The organic farm had a
   significantly ameliorated soil structure: with an increased A horizon
   depth, organic matter content, porosity, earthworm abundance and
   activity, and coarser, better developed aggregates than the conventional
   farm. Moreover, the conventional farm also suffered from compaction and
   erosion. This study indicates that, over the long-term, organic
   management methods are able to maintain and improve the structure of the
   soil, resulting in a soil with tilth more conducive to promoting crop
   growth, than conventional methods which degrade the soil.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dual-porosity MACRO model has been used to
   investigate methods of reducing leaching of isoproturon from a
   structured heavy clay soil. The MACRO model was applied to a pesticide
   leaching data-set generated from a plot scale experiment on a heavy clay
   soil at the Oxford University Farm, Wytham, England. The field drain was
   found to be the most important outflow from the plot in terms of
   pesticide removal. Therefore, this modelling exercise concentrated on
   simulating field drain flow. With calibration of field-saturated and
   micropore saturated hydraulic conductivity, the drain flow hydrographs
   were simulated during extended periods of above average rainfall, with
   both the hydrograph shape and peak flows agreeing well. Over the whole
   field season, the observed drain flow water budget was well simulated.
   However, the first and second drain flow events after pesticide
   application were not simulated satisfactorily. This is believed to be
   due to a poor simulation of evapotranspiration during a period of low
   rainfall around the pesticide application day. Apart from an initial
   rapid drop in the observed isoproturon soil residue, the model simulated
   isoproturon residues during the 100 days after pesticide application
   reasonably well. Finally, the calibrated model was used to show that
   changes in agricultural practice (deep ploughing, creating fine
   consolidated seed beds and organic matter applications) could
   potentially reduce pesticide leaching to surface waters by up to 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of biomass
   burning, and biological processes in soils. Biomass burning is not only
   an instantaneous source of nitrous oxide, but it results in a longer
   term enhancement of the biogenic production of this gas. Measurements of
   nitrous oxide emissions from soils before and after a controlled burn
   showed that significantly more nitrous oxide was exhaled after the burn.
   The current belief is that 90\% of the emissions come from soils.
   Nitrous oxide is formed in soils during the microbiological processes
   nitrification and denitrification. Because nitrous oxide is a gas it can
   escape from soil during these transformations. Nitrous oxide production
   is controlled by temperature, pH, water holding capacity of the soil,
   irrigation practices, fertilizer rate, tillage practice, soil type,
   oxygen concentration, availability of carbon, vegetation, land use
   practices and use of chemicals. Nitrous oxide emissions from
   agricultural soils are increased by the addition of fertilizer nitrogen
   and by the growth of legumes to fix atmospheric nitrogen. A recent
   analysis suggests that emissions of nitrous oxide from fertilized soils
   are not related to the type of fertilizer nitrogen applied and emissions
   can be calculated from the amount of nitrogen applied. Legumes also
   contribute to nitrous oxide emission in a number of ways, viz.
   atmospheric nitrogen fixed by legumes can be nitrified and denitrified
   in the same way as fertilizer nitrogen, thus providing a source of
   nitrous oxide, and symbiotically living Rhizobia in root nodules are
   able to denitrify and produce nitrous oxide. Conversion of tropical
   forests to crop production and pasture has a significant effect on the
   emission of nitrous oxide. Emissions of nitrous oxide increased by about
   a factor of two when a forest in central Brazil was clear cut, and
   pasture soils in the same area produced three times as much nitrous
   oxide as adjacent forest soils. Studies on temperate and tropical rice
   fields show that less than 0.1\% of the applied nitrogen is emitted as
   nitrous oxide if the soils are flooded for a number of days before
   fertilizer application. However, if mineral nitrogen is present in the
   soil before flooding it will serve as a source of nitrous oxide during
   wetting and drying cycles before permanent flooding. Thus dry seeded
   rice can be a source of considerable nitrous oxide. There are also
   indirect contributions to nitrous oxide emission through volatilization
   of ammonia and emission of nitric oxides into the atmosphere, and their
   redistribution over the landscape through wet and dry deposition. In
   general nitrous oxide emissions can be decreased by management practices
   which optimize the crop's natural ability to compete with processes
   whereby plant available nitrogen is lost from the soil-plant system. If
   these options were implemented they would also result in increased
   productivity and reduced inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for using coal-derived humic substances to improve the

   agricultural surface (0-20 cm) soil from each of three regions of Italy,
   (Sicily), Tuscany and Venetia) and five rates of humic acids (HA), 0,
   0.05, 0.10, 0.50 and 1.00 g/kg. There were significant (P < 0.05)
   differences between the field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point
   (PWP), and available water capacity (AWC) values of the controls and
   those treated with 0.05 g/kg of the HA. Beyond this rate, differences in
   these properties were not significant. At the 1.00 g/kg HA rate, the
   relative improvements in AWC over the three controls were 30\%, 10\% and
   26\%. Low rates (0.05 to 0.10 g/kg) of HA were also needed to obtain a
   40 to 120\% improvement in aggregate stability of these soils relative

   humified organic matter such as coal-derived humic substances can
   improve the structural and water retention properties of degraded arable

Abstract = {{Assessments of the effects of deforestation, post-clearance tillage
   methods and farming systems treatments on soil properties were made from
   1978 through 1987 on agricultural watersheds near Ibadan, southwestern
   Nigeria. These experiments were conducted in two phases: Phase I from
   1978 through 1981 and Phase II from 1983 to 1987, with 1 year (1982) as
   a transition phase when all plots were sown with mucuna (Mucuna utilis).
   There were six treatments in Phase I involving combinations of land
   clearing and tillage methods: (1) manual clearing with no-till (MC-NT);
   (2) manual clearing with plough-till (MC-PT); (3) shear-blade clearing
   with no-till (SB-NT); (4) tree-pusher/root rake clearing with no-till
   (TP-NT); (5) tree-pusher/root-rake clearing with plough-till (TP-PT);
   (6) traditional farming (TF). The six treatments were replicated twice
   in a completely randomized design. The traditional treatment of Phase I
   was discontinued during Phase II. The five farming systems studied
   during Phase II with a no-till system in all treatments were: (1) alley
   cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m
   intervals; (2) and (3) fallowing with Mucuna utilis on severely degraded
   and moderately degraded watersheds, respectively, for 1 year followed by
   maize-cowpea rotation for another; (4) and (5) ley farming involving
   establishment of pasture in the first year on severely and moderately
   degraded plots, respectively, controlled grazing in the second year, and
   growing maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in the third year.
   All treatments, imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, were replicated
   twice. The soil properties analyzed were particle size distribution,
   total aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates, soil bulk
   density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics,
   infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. These
   properties were measured under the forest cover in 1978, and once every
   year during the dry season thereafter during Phases I and II. Prior to
   deforestation, mean soil bulk density was 0.72 Mg m(-3) and 1.30 Mg
   m(-3), soil penetration resistance was 32.4 KPa and 90.7 KPa, and mean
   weight diameter of aggregates was 3.7 mm and 3.2 mm for 0-5 cm and 5-10
   cm depths, respectively. The infiltration rate was excessive (54-334 cm
   hr(-1)) and saturated hydraulic conductivity was rapid (166-499 cm
   hr(-1)) under the forest cover. Furthermore, water transmission
   properties varied significantly even over short distances of about 1 m.
   Deforestation and cultivation increased soil bulk density and
   penetration resistance but decreased mean weight diameter of aggregates.
   One year after deforestation in 1980, mean soil bulk density was 1.41 Mg
   m(-3) for 0-5 cm depth and 1.58 Mg m(-3) for 5-10 cm depth. Soil bulk
   density and penetration resistance were generally higher for NT than for
   PT methods, and the penetration resistance was extremely high in all
   treatments by 1985. During Phase II, soil bulk density was high during
   the grazing cycle of the ley farming treatment. Sand content at 0-5 cm
   depth increased and clay content decreased with cultivation duration.
   Soon after deforestation, saturated hydraulic conductivity and
   equilibrium infiltration rate in cleared and cultivated land declined to
   only 20-30 per cent of that under forest. Mean saturated hydraulic
   conductivity following deforestation was 46.0 cm hr(-1) for 0-5 cm depth
   and 53.
   7 cm hr(-1) for 5-10 cm depth. Further, infiltration rate declined with
   deforestation and cultivation duration in all cropping systems
   treatments. During Phase I, mean infiltration rate was 115.
   8 cm hr(-1) under forest cover in 1978, 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1979, 17.4 cm
   hr(-1) in 1980 and 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1981. During Phase II, mean
   infiltration rate was 8.5 cm hr(-1) in 1982, 11.9 cm hr(-1) in 1983,
   11.0 cm hr(-1) in 1984, 11.3 cm hr(-1) in 1985 and 5.3 cm hr(-1) in
   1986. Infiltration rate was generally high in ley farming and mucuna
   fallowing treatments. Natural fallowing drastically improved the
   infiltration rate from 19.2 cm hr(-1) in 1982 to 193.2 cm hr(-1) in
   1986, a ten-fold increase within 5 years of fallowing. High-energy soil
   water retention characteristics in Phase I were affected by those
   treatments that caused soil compaction by mechanized clearing and
   no-till systems. Soil water retention at 0.01 MPa potential in 1979 was
   19.2 per cent (gravimetrics) for SE, 17.9 per cent for TP, 15.9 per cent
   for MC and 17.8 per cent for TF methods. With regards to tillage, soil
   water retention was 17.8 per cent for NT compared with 16.8 per cent for
   PT. During Phase II, water retention characteristics were not affected
   by the farming system treatments. Mean soil water retention (average of
   4 years' data from 1982 to 1986) at 0.01 MPa for 0-5 cm depth was 16.6
   per cent for alley cropping, 16.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing and 16.8
   per cent for ley farming. Mean soil water retention for 1.5 MPa suction
   was 9.3 per cent for alley cropping, 8.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing,
   and 9.3 per cent for ley farming. Water retention at 1.5 MPa suction
   correlated with the clay and soil organic carbon content.}},

   soil, in which four soil water contents were established.
   Denitrification rates were measured in soil cores kept in a

   showed that: (1) denitrification rates in the soil under study were
   primarily affected by soil water conditions; (2) the effect of
   temperature on denitrification rate was stronger in non-irrigated plots;
   and (3) N-application rate had no effect on denitrification rates
   because NO3- was not limiting. The results of the laboratory experiment
   indicated that denitrification rates were very low when the soil
   water-filled porosity had decreased below a threshold value, which

Abstract = {{Use of reduced tillage practices and inputs of organic materials, rather
   than chemical fertilizers, has been suggested as a method of `low input
   agriculture' to achieve sustainability in dryland agriculture. This
   study evaluated the effects of incorporation of plant residue and
   chemical fertilizer under reduced tillage on biomass and grain yield of
   dryland (rainfed) rice (Oryza sativa L.). Four treatments were
   established: (a) a no-input control; (b) chemical fertilizer 80 kg N
   ha(-1), 40 kg P ha(-1), and 30 kg K ha(-1); (c) air-dried wheat straw
   (organic C 378 g kg(-1), total N 4.8 g kg(-1), total P 0.9 g kg(-1), C/N
   ratio 75.5) at 20 Mg ha(-1) (the amount of N in straw was equivalent to
   that applied with chemical fertilizer); (d) wheat straw + fertilizer,
   straw applied at 10 Mg ha(-1) and rate of fertilizer 50\% of (b). The
   soil type at the site is a Inceptisol and, a silt loam, pH 6.7 and water
   holding capacity 405 g kg(-1). Straw and fertilizer treatments were
   applied about 3 weeks before planting. Inorganic N (nitrate+ammonium-N)
   concentrations in the control, fertilizer, straw, and straw+fertilizer
   amended soils were 7.2, 11.6, 8.6 and 11.5 mu g g(-1), respectively.
   Available P was greatest in the straw+fertilizer treated plots (16.7 mu
   g g(-1)) followed by fertilizer (16.0 mu g g(-1)), straw (14.2 mu g
   g(-1)) and the control (12.0 pg g(-1)). The rates of N-mineralization in
   the straw C fertilizer, fertilizer and straw treatments were 16.6, 14.3
   and 11.2 pg g(-1) month(-1), respectively. Microbial biomass C, N and P
   were 66, 77 and 49\% greater, respectively, in the straw+fertilizer
   treated plots than in the control. Total crop biomass ranged from
   6.79-9.91 Mg ha(-1) and grain yield ranged from 1.08-1.46 Mg ha(-1),
   both in the order: control<straw<fertilizer<fertilizer+straw. There were
   strong positive relationships between grain yield and microbial biomass
   (r= 0.84, P<0.001), N-mineralization (r=0.85, P<0.001), and available P
   (r=0.84,P<0.001). The combined input of straw and fertilizer could be an
   ideal practice to improve soil fertility and thereby the productivity of
   rice under dryland (rainfed) conditions.}},

Abstract = {{During the initial season of implementation, four tomato production
   systems differing in soil management, pest control practices, and level
   of inputs, such as labor, materials, and management intensity were
   evaluated, These systems were CON, a low input (no mulch, no trellising,
   overhead irrigation, preplant fertilization, scheduled pest control),
   conventional agrichemical system; BLD, a high input {[}straw mulch,
   trellising, trickle irrigation, compost fertility amendment, integrated
   pest management (IPM)], ecologically-oriented system that emphasized the
   building up of soil organic matter levels and used no agrichemicals to
   supply fertility or for pest control; BLD+, a system similar to BLD,
   except that agrichemical pesticides were used; and ICM, a high input
   system (blackpolyethylene mulch, trellising, trickle irrigation,
   fertigation,IPM pest control) that used agrichemicals to supply
   fertility and for pest control. Soil characteristics and fertility
   levels in the BLD and BLD+ systems were modified with extensive
   amendments of spent mushroom compost and well-rotted cattle manure.
   Levels of agrichemical NPK calculated to meet current crop needs were
   supplied to the CON and ICM systems, with 75 \% of fertility in the ICM
   system supplied through the trickle irrigation lines (fertigation). The
   BLD system had a greater soil water holding capacity and sharply reduced
   irrigation requirements. During a wet period, fruit cracking and
   evidence of water-mold root rot were significantly higher in the ICM
   system than the BLD and CON systems. Defoliation by Alternaria solani
   was greatest in the BLD system and least in the ICM system. The BLD and
   ICM systems resulted in a 1 week earlier peak yield compared to the CON
   system. The yield of No. 1 fruit was 55\% to 60\% greater in the BLD+
   system than the other three systems, which were comparable in yield. Net
   return was highest in the BLD+ system, although the benefit/cost ratio
   was greatest in the CON system. This multidisciplinary study has
   identified important differences in the performance of diverse
   production systems during the unique transitional season.}},

Abstract = {{Crop production depends not only on the yield but also on the area
   harvested. The yield response to climate change has been widely
   examined, but the sensitivity of crop land use to hypothetical climate
   change has not been examined directly. Crop land-use regression models
   for estimating crop area indices (CAIs)-the percent of land used for
   corn, soybean, wheat, and sorghum production-are presented. Inputs to
   the models include available water-holding capacity of the soil, percent
   of land available for rain-fed agricultural production, annual
   precipitation, and annual temperature. The total variance of CAI
   explained by the models ranged from 78\% for wheat to 87\% for sorghum,
   and the root-mean-square errors ranged from 1.74\% for sorghum to 4.24\%
   for corn. The introduction of additional climatic variables to the
   models did not significantly improve their performance.
   The crop land-use models were used to predict the CAI for every crop
   reporting district in the United States for the current climatic
   condition and for possible future climate change scenarios (various
   combinations of temperature and precipitation changes over a range of -3
   degrees to +60 degrees and -20\% to +20\%, respectively). The magnitude
   of climatic warming suggested by GCMs (GISS and GFDL) is from 3.5
   degrees to 5.9 degrees C for regions of the United States. For this
   magnitude of warming, the model suggests corn and soybean production
   areas may decline while wheat and sorghum production areas may expand.
   If the warming is accompanied by a decrease in annual precipitation from
   1\% to 10\%, then the areas used for corn and soybean production could
   decrease by as much as 20\% and 40\%, respectively. The area for sorghum
   and wheat under these conditions would increase by as much as 80\% and
   70\%, respectively; the exact amount depending strongly on the change in
   precipitation. In general, small changes in temperature or precipitation
   produced larger corresponding changes (on a percentage basis) in
   soybean, wheat, and sorghum area than in corn area.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-57}},
Abstract = {{Virgin krasnozems contain about 6\% C from 0-15 cm and, while the C
   content is less at depth, the total C reserves may exceed 200 t ha(-1)
   to about Im depth. Highest organic matter contents occur where the
   annual rainfall is 1500+/-200 mm. At higher rainfalls, the C contents
   are less. There is a negative correlation between organic C and N
   content and mean annual temperature.
   Krasnozems contain more C than other soils in the same climate and are
   comparatively more fertile. Correlations of C contents with clay
   contents are confounded by the contents of free iron oxides.
   While data are fragmented, it is evident that the clearing of
   rainforests and replacement by pastures or other agricultural and
   horticultural pursuits have led to losses of up to 50\% of the organic C
   over several decades. A simple model illustrates that this is caused by
   lower inputs of C to the soil in most situations except perhaps long
   term productive pastures where inputs may be greater than under
   rainforests.
   Studies using natural isotopes of C have shown the persistence of some C
   in krasnozems for hundreds of years. Some of this is particulate organic
   matter occluded in aggregates but most of it appears to be associated
   with clays, particularly at depth.
   The chemistry of organic matter in krasnozems appears similar to that of
   other soils, although solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance has
   shown more aliphatic materials in krasnozems than other soils, but the
   reason for this is not clear.
   There is little information on biota in krasnozems. The deep well
   structured soils are a good habitat for organisms and their high
   fertility guarantees a good supply of substrate for fauna and flora.
   It is important to maintain the organic matter contents of krasnozems to
   maintain cation exchange capacity, mineralization of N and other
   elements, to decrease phosphate sorption and to stabilize larger
   aggregates and thus macro porosity.}},

Abstract = {{A field plot experiment of 271 days duration was conducted on New
   Zealand irrigated pastures, commencing in the summer (January) 1988, on
   a Templeton silt loam soil (Udic Ustochrept) by applying sulphur-35
   (S-35)-labelled urine (250 muci/g S with 1300 mug S/ml) to field plots
   (600 x 600 mm) at a rate equivalent to that normally occurring in sheep
   urine patches (150 ml/0.03 m2) to investigate the distribution,
   transformations and recovery of urinary S in pasture soil-plant systems
   and sources of plant-available soil S as influenced by the available
   soil moisture at the time of urine application and varying amounts of
   applied irrigation water. Results obtained showed that c. 55-90\% of
   S-35-labelled urine was incorporated into soil sulphate (SO42-), ester
   SO42- and carbon (C)-bonded S fractions within the major plant rooting
   zone (0-300 mm), as early as 27 days after urine application. Hydriodic
   acid (HI)-reducible and C-bonded soil S fractions showed no consistent
   trend of incorporation. On day 271, labelled-S was found in soil SO42-,
   HI-reducible S and C-bonded S fractions to a soil depth of 500 mm,
   indicating that not only SO42- but also organic S fractions from soils
   and S-35-labelled urine were leached beyond the major rooting zone. A
   large proportion (c. 59-75\%) of S-35-labelled urine was not recovered
   in pasture soil-plant systems over a 271-day period, presumably due to
   leaching losses beyond the 0-300 mm soil depth. This estimated leaching
   loss was comparable to that (75\%) predicted using the S model developed
   by the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture. The recovery of urinary S in
   soil-plant systems over a 271-day period was not affected by different
   amounts of irrigation water applied 7 days after urine application to
   soil at either 50 or 75\% available water holding capacity (AWHC).
   However, significantly lower S recovery occurred when urinary S was
   applied to the soil at 25\% AWHC than at field capacity, suggesting that
   urinary S applied at field capacity might not have sufficient time to be
   adsorbed by soil particles, enter soil micropores or be immobilized by
   soil micro-organisms. Both soil ester SO42- and calcium
   phosphate-extractable soil S in urine-treated soils were found to be
   major S sources for pasture S uptake. Labelled S from S-35-labelled
   urine accounted for c. 12-47\% of total S in pasture herbage.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty per cent, more or less, of the soil organic matter from farm lands
   has been lost. The remainder is perhaps more resistant to loss and
   therefore is stable but that which has been lost was perhaps the most
   important half--it resisted erosion, it made soils permeable, it
   increased water-holding capacity and it produced healthy crops. The 50
   per cent that has been lost is via two major mechanisms. One is loss per
   unit weight of soil by decomposition (mineralization) induced by
   cultivation, and the other is loss, by erosion--loss by wash away and
   blow away of the surface soil which contains the most soil organic
   matter. Both mineralization and erosion are downhill processes. If they
   are not in equilibrium with reverse processes, the land cannot be
   sustainable. If agriculture is to be sustainable, we have to look at
   soil organic matter, first and foremost, as a means for maintaining
   stable-tillable soil. Mining of soil for nutrients and letting soil
   organic matter levels decrease can never result in sustainable
   agriculture. The role of soil organic matter as a source of nitrogen and

Abstract = {{Soils derived from granite form the basis of agricultural crop
   production in most of Zimbabwe's smallholder farming areas. Yet, in the
   past, little research was carried out on granitic soils, particularly
   those that are subject to a seasonally high water table. This study is
   thus aimed at improving the limited knowledge about the nature and
   properties of the latter with special attention given to their
   agricultural use.
   A general feature of gleyic granitic soils is their low clay
   (less-than-or-equal-to 5\% in the upper 300 mm of the soil) and organic
   matter content (less-than-or-equal-to 1\% under permanent cultivation)
   which imparts low water-holding capacity (approx. 100 mm m-1) upon them.
   Consequently, crops grown on these soils frequently suffer from water
   stress.
   Crop production is equally difficult in high rainfall years, when the
   shallow undulating bedrock prevents water percolation to great depth. In
   such years, waterlogging suppresses yields. Furthermore, applied
   fertilizer nutrients and clay particles are being lost through leaching.
   This further aggravates the already very low soil fertility status.
   Because of their high bulk densities (up to 1.7 Mg m-3) and high
   penetration resistance (up to 3000 kPa), these soils only provide for a
   limited rooting depth (max. 500 mm). The observed high soil compaction
   also renders tillage difficult. This is made worse by the presence of
   in-situ formed stone lines at shallow depths.
   Given their poor properties, gleyic soils require careful management and
   a minimum amount of cultivation and fertilization.}},

   kg), meadow foxtail (6 kg).  The total sowing rate was 33 kg per 1 ha.
   The site was drained by a systematic drainage consisted of polyvinyl
   chloride PVC pipes, a diameter of collecting drains was 63mm, that of
   leaky drains was 75 mm.  A spacing of the drainage is 15 m and 0,9 m is
   a depth of collecting drains.  The water supply to drainage segment is
   based on the gravitational principle, the water table regulation in
   manholes is dependent on sliding spilway pipe, adjustable to the
   required level. Damming of water is regulated always from a sinlge place
   of particular drainage group on the header. To evaluate the soil load
   capacity, physical properties of soil cover are important, especially
   those in surface soil horizons.  In hydrological survey, an attention
   was paid to the evaluation of soil texture.  The soil to the depth of
   0.25 m can be classified as soft-textured sandy loam with grain-size
   grade I ranging from 23.25 to 26.08 \%, the grain-size grade II is
   ranging from 29.88 to 36.28 \%.
   In view of physical properties of the soil it was manifested that the
   porosity and reduced bulk density are influenced by tha amount of root
   mass in the surface layer, that is its mineralization in dependence on
   the water regime of the site.  The porosity was about  61 to 62 \% of
   bulk on drier soil, this being even 68 \% vol. on waterlogged sites. 
   This is accompanied also by a decrease in the reduced bulk density in
   moisture site to the value of 0.83 g per cm3.
   A maximum capillary capacity to the depth of 0.15 m was 57 \% vol., this
   was 51 to 57\% vol. to depth of 0.25 m.  Specific weight ranged from
   2.63 to 2.70 g per cm3.  In view of hydraulic conductivity of the soil
   after drainage, the soil profile may be characterized by three layers. 
   The first layer is sod, permeable for water in the range of 0.5 mm and
   day, and more.  This layer is limited to the depth of the profile to
   0.20 m.  The second layer consists of loams at the depth of 0.2 to 0.8 m
   with markedly fluctuating sand addition in the profile. Hydraulic
   conductivity is sporadically 0.5 m per day, but also 0.116 to 0.011 m
   per day (measured on the Kopecky rollers).  In this view it seems to be
   impermeable.  The third layer to the depth of 0.8 m is composed of sands
   of permeability (measured JSM) ranging from 2.54 to 3.22 m per day.
   The permeability of the sod layer, being the result of the root system
   of the soil profile, brings many problems in terrain runoff-less
   depressions when rainfall water runs down the less permeable layer at
   the depth of 0.2 m to the depression places instead of slow and uniform
   infiltration through the whole soil profile (a prerequisition is almost
   the same permeability of the soil profile).  In depression water
   stagnates and causes a marked stand degradation associated with a
   disorder of plot load capacity.  Precipataion water causes a change in
   the mositrue of surface layers, though this did not change the reduced
   bulk density essentially when hydraulic pressure of water breaks
   capillary pores and the change in the ratio of capillary and
   gravitational pores appears, this leading to the disintegration of the
   soil texture.  In groundwater table regulation (GWT), these problems
   occurred too, though not in dependence on the GWT.  Extreme GWT values,
   however, had an impact on capillary water content in soil.
   The course of GWT on the regulated block is presented in Fig. 1.  This
   gives the GWT values in the growing season and in relation to rainfall
   as well.  GWT values were obtained by measurements on four corner plots
   of experimental blocks.  It follows from Fig. 1 that there is an impact
   of water supply in the spring period on the level of GWT regulation. 
   The effect of higher water levels was confirmed in the Jankovsky flow in
   relation to GWT of experimetal plots.  The regulation of optimum levels
   of GWT can be gained only with problems in recent period.  This fact is
   connected with drainage effect of the flow.  GWT response to the
   draining function of the drainage was very good and on the contrary, GWT
   regulation made in June and July confirms also a good response time. 
   The effect of the GWT regulation on the experimental block can be seen
   in Tab. II. The first period of the regulation shows that the
   differentiation of average GWT here is not practically high (the effect
   of spring water reverses).  GWT is ranging from 0.31 to 0.,48 m under
   the terrain.  The second period of the regulation already manifested
   that prerequisitions of GWT formation created at the end  of the study
   can be obtained (Tab. III).  Despite it, as can be seen from the maximum
   and minimum GWT values, GWT values are not stabilized.  GWT formation is
   influenced by many factors (rainfall, the stroke of water table in
   river, drainage function of the flow, effect of springs in its
   regulation.  In the period without regulation, that is only drainae
   function, identical GWT values can be obtained.  In 1989 when GWT values
   were of extreme levels, the soil load capacity was measured by the Gotke
   probe collectin the soil moisture and with rollers to determine the
   physical properties of soil.  The following blocks were studied: 
   ecoblock E - non-recultivated, block with regulation A and C2. Tab. IV
   presents the quantities having a decisive role in the soil load
   capacity. It follows from this comparison a low, extreme value of
   reduced bulk density in the E block caused mainly by organic matter
   content in the surface layer of thc soil profile. Humification prevails
   over mineralization as an expression of extensive utilization of the
   plot and non-regulated water regime.
   The soil moisture in the time of measuring was very low, differed from
   regulated levels where this was on the level of 50 \% vol. At the same
   time, a high soil moisture in regulated localities had no effect on the
   soil load capacity. as this was below the level of the maximum capillary
   capacity, being on the level of 56 to 57 \% vol. In thc soil prevailed
   capillary water whose effect was not destructive on the change of plot
   load capacity. Thus, a decisive criterion is reduced bulk density and
   the presence of gravitational water in soil. Even at these high GWT
   values in the block A, C2, it can be said that the plot load capacity
   was good in all, satisfying to present mechanization of the pressure 300
   to 400 kPa.  The distribution of precipitation helped to this during the
   growing season when there was a deficit of precipitation extremes in
   July and August. Maximum precipitation sums for a month were 60 to 70
   mm. In depression places, where the surface is not always even, the
   terrain load capacity is broken due to over-moistening of thc soil
   profile from upper parts, that is in the places even where is no GWT. It
   seems that the change in the soil resistance in permanent grasslands in
   dependence on the soil moisture and reduced bulk density is very
   complicated at a low reduced bulk density (below the value 0.9 g per
   cm3), the soil moisture is not decisive, but organic matter content in
   soil is well applied here. In this field a decrease of the soil
   resistance will be nonlinear with the decrease in the soil resistance
   caused by the soil moisture at sites with sufficient reduced bulk
   density.}},

Abstract = {{The West African Semi-Arid Tropics (WASAT) is characterized by a
   monomodal rainfall pattern, and based on the amount of annual rainfall
   it can be divided into three ecologies:  Sahel, Sudan and Northern
   Guinea savannahs.  The major soil groups of the WASAT are Alfisols,
   Inceptisols and Entisols and Vertisols, with the former three
   predominating.  The major soil constraints to crop growth are:  soil
   compaction, low fertility, high temperature and low soil water
   retention, available water holding capacity and infiltration rate. 
   Tillage in traditional farming systems is manual.  However,
   mechanization of tillage operations has received emphasis in the recent
   past.  The accelerated soil degradation, which is a feature of
   mechanized-tillage systems under rainfed agriculture can be minimized
   with no tillage.  However, lower yields have been reported to occur with
   no tillage.  Some possible reasons are:  the absence or low amounts of
   residue mulch, high soil compaction, the presence of harmful soil
   insects in crop residues, the creation of stable pores by tillage in
   soils of high organic matter, silt and fine sand contents. 
   Unavailability of crop residues is a major impediment to the adoption of
   no tillage.  The use of heavy and intensive mechanical tillage in
   irrigated agriculture leads to the formation of plow soles.  Deep
   tillage such as subsoiling does not ensure the elimination of plow
   soles.  While no tillage appears to hold promise for use in the
   irrigated agriculture of the WASAT much research remains to be done.}},

Abstract = {{Chamber measurements of CO2 evolution were made on bare soil, and in
   maize (1988) and wheat (1989) crops in order to study the spatial and
   temporal variability of soil respiration (Rsoil).  Semivariograms showed
   no definite structure of spatial auto-correlation on bare soil when
   measurements were made along transects.  Spatial variability was shown
   to occur at a scale smaller than 15 cm.  In a maize crop, Rsoil in the
   row was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than in the interrow when the
   soil surface was dry.  Under wet soil conditions, Rsoil in the interrow
   compacted by the tractor wheel was lower (P = 0.05) than on noncompacted
   soil and no significant difference was found between rows and interrows.
   These observations were attributed to the contribution of plant roots to
   Rsoil in dry conditions.  In wetter soil, the role of microbial activity
   was dominant except in the compacted interrow where lower airfilled
   porosity caused lower Rsoil.  Random measurements in a wheat crop over
   the growing season showed that the number of samples needed to estimate
   the Rsoil of a 1 ha area within 10\% (P = 0.05) of its mean value
   decreased from 190 at the time of seeding to 30 at the end of the
   season.  The maximum Rsoil during the growing season coincided with the
   period of maximum growth of both crops.  A post-rainfall Rsoil burst is
   also described.  Immediately after a 2-h rainfall event, when soil was
   at field capacity, Rsoil was nine times higher than its level prior to
   the rainfall and gradually decreased with time.}},
