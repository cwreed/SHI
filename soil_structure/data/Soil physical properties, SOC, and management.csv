Three soils of different texture (sandy-loam, loam and clay-loam) were selected, and mercury intrusion porosimetry and surface area analysis were used to examine changes in the microstructural characteristics caused by the reactions that occur between the mucilage and soil particles. Laboratory studies were conducted to characterise the selected herbicides with regard their sorption on tested soils added or not with the mucilage. Mucilage amendment resulted in a reduction in soil porosity, basically due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 10 mu m) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 10 mu m) and in partcles' surface. A higher herbicide sorption in the amended soils was ascertained when compared to unamended soils. The sorption percentage of herbicides in soils treated with mucilage increased in the order; sandy-loam < loam < clay-loam. The increase in the organic carbon content upon amendment and the natural clay content of the soils are revealed to be responsible for the higher adsorption of Diuron when compared with Terbuthylazine, Clomazone and MCPA. Desorption of the herbicides was highly inhibited in the soils treated with mucilage; only Terbuthylazine showed a slight desorption in the case of loam and clay loam-soils. This study leads to the conclusion thatmucilage from Chia seeds used as soil conditioner can reduce the mobility of herbicides tested in agricultural soils with different physico-chemical properties.

Vineyards are part of the Mediterranean culture, their management can be sustainable. We propose the setup of two types of groundcovers with the aim to assess their potential influence to improve soil properties. A field trial was performed to compare the effects of a seeded (Brachypodium distachyon) and spontaneous groundcovers, on a set of soil parameters, in comparison with the traditional tillage in four vineyards located in the center of Spain. Three years after the groundcovers establishment soil organic carbon stocks increased up to 1.62 and 3.18 Mg ha(-1) for the seeded and the spontaneous groundcovers, respectively, compared to conventional tillage. Both labile and stable fractions improved their soil organic carbon content with the use of groundcovers, particularly the labile fraction. Moreover, soil structure and functional soil properties improved through better aggregate stability, pore connectivity and infiltration rates. The higher root biomass input of the spontaneous groundcovers derived in higher soil organic carbon increases and soil quality improvement. Consequently, under low rainfall conditions (<400 mm per year) spontaneous vegetation, properly managed according to site conditions, is an effective soil management strategy to revert soil degradation and increase soil quality in Mediterranean vineyards.

Especially in Brazil, no-tillage (NT) cropping was adopted as a type of soil management that possibly preserves soil functions. Hence, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect and intensity of long-term NT compared to soil under natural forest (NF) or grassland (NG) based on parameters of composition (density, porosity, water retention) and functionality by means of mechanical strength (precompression stress sigma(p), cyclic compressibility c(n)), air permeability K-a, and saturated hydraulic conductivity k(s). The studied Hapludox, Hapludalf and Quartzipsamment from southern Brazil under subtropical climate mostly reacted based upon their grain size distribution, namely clay, loamy sand and loamy fine sand. The largest impact appeared in the Hapludox, where compaction occurred (higher sigma(p), lower c(n) and smaller porosity, especially macroporosity). k(s) and K-a were highest at the surface of the Hapludox under NF, but were reduced strongly under NT. In both the Hapludox and the Hapludalf deeper soil layers were also affected by NT, but in the clayey Hapludox the applied pressure resulted in the largest compacted layer. The Hapludalf of loamy sand texture showed, supposedly due to shallow soil operations, a weak, but permeable surface layer under NT above a dense layer, while the other layers were only slightly affected by cropping. In the Quartzipsamment, there was no increase in or, and little in cm whereas density in deeper layers slightly decreased. While k(s) was increased strongly under NT compared to NG, the opposite was found for K-a which could not be explained by the investigated parameters. The results demonstrate that soil under NT might be significantly affected by soil compaction with regard to soil functions if not adequately managed by adjusted machinery. This is of even greater importance in fine-textured soils like the investigated Hapludox, compared to coarse-textured soils of poor aggregation like the investigated Quartzipsamment.","Brandt, Andre Anibal; Holthusen, Dorthe; Horn, Rainer; Reichert, Jose Miguel",,177,2018,,,

Both consumer demand for local sustainably produced food, and the number of small farms is increasing in RI, highlighting the importance of characterizing the effects livestock have on the quality of pasture soils. To assess how livestock affect pasture on Charlton and Canton soils series in RI, we examined soil quality in farms raising beef cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), and horses (Equus ferus caballus), using hayed pastures as a control. We sampled three pastures per livestock type and three control hayed pastures in May, August, and October 2012. Hay fields and pastures grazed by sheep had statistically significant (P < 0.001) better soil quality than pastures grazed by beef cattle or horses. This was driven by parameters including penetration resistance, bulk density, aggregate stability, and infiltration rate. Hayfields also showed higher soil quality measures than grazed pastures for organic matter content and active C. In addition, significant differences in nitrate and phosphate concentrations were observed among livestock types. Respiration and infiltration rates, pH, and ammonium concentrations, on the other hand, did not differ significantly among pasture types. When all soil quality indicators in this study were weighed equally, soil quality scores followed the order: hay > sheep > beef cattle > horses. The results of our study provide baseline data on the effect different types of livestock have on pasture soil quality in RI, which may be useful in making sound land use and agricultural management decisions.","Amador, Jose A.; Cox, Alissa H.",,190,2018,,,

We studied the soil properties underlining the response of wheat yield to YCC in 80 on-farm trials during three growing seasons. We determined the frontier yield and the yield gap under limited (Y-F(-), or best technical means) and unlimited nutrient supply (Y-F(+), supplemental additions of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur). For each field, we assessed soil quality based on soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (Bray I), soil texture, field water infiltration rate (INF), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN). We also calculated a climatological index (CI) that combines temperature, radiation and precipitation during both the spike and early grain growth phases. We estimated Y-F(-) and Y(F)(+)using stochastic frontier production functions with CI, YCC and soil properties as predictor variables. The Y-F(-) and Y-F(+) after a perennial pasture were 6.9 and 8.4 Mg ha(-1), with the 1.5 Mg ha(-1) yield gap attributable to nutrient supply limitations. However, while Y-F(-) declined by 0.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) from YCC = 1 to 10 (P <= 0.05), Y-F(+) stayed at roughly the same level till YCC = 5, declining thereafter by 0.17 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (P <= 0.05). Reduced soil nutrient supply capacity, partially quantified as PMN and amendable with supplemental fertilization, limited 17 during the first five years after pasture. The subsequent 17 decline could not be compensated by increased nutrient supply. After 10 years, the yield gap between Y-F(+) for YCC = 1 and Y-F(-) for YCC = 10, increased to 2.6 Mg ha(-1). Up to 40% of this gap was explained by a deterioration of the soil quality that was independent of the nutrient supply; the decline after five years of continuous cropping was best explained by INF. Thus, continuous annual cropping under no-till generated a progressive increase in the wheat yield gap associated to deterioration in soil quality that could be corrected with supplemental fertilization only in the first years after a pasture, but not thereafter, when soil physical properties seemed to degrade past a threshold that limited wheat yield and reduced nutrient use efficiency.","Cadenazzi, Monica; Dogliotti, Santiago; Ernst, Oswaldo R.; Kemanian, Armen R.",,217,2018,,,

Therefore, even though they represent < 1% of the soils worldwide, they are very important for global and local agriculture, as they account for > 60% of the arable land of Chile. However, studies evaluating their soil quality are still scarce. Subsequently, soil quality indicators have not yet been established for Chilean volcanic soils. Hence, the aim of this study was to select a set of soil quality indicators to evaluate changes in Chilean volcanic soils, mainly due to land use, but also considering seasonal changes. Thus, three soils derived from volcanic materials were sampled (with different intrinsic properties), on five sampling dates, under three land uses (intensities): native forest (NF), prairie (P) and crops (C). Soil samples were taken to evaluate both chemical (disturbed samples) and physical (undisturbed cylinders and soil blocks) properties. A total of 27 soil properties were measured and/or calculated, among these are: penetration resistance, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air conductivity, bulk density, total porosity pore size distribution, aggregate stability, pH, nutrient contents, Al saturation, effective cation exchange capacity, soil organic carbon and extractable Al. To effectively select the indicators a multivariate analysis (PCA) was performed. The proposed set of indicators for soils derived from volcanic materials include: i) bulk density, ii) plant available water pores in volcanic soils, iii) wide coarse pores, iv) air conductivity at 6 kPa, v) soil organic carbon, vi) extractable Al with ammonium acetate, vii) pH in water, viii) P Olsen and ix) base sum. Main difference in soil quality indicators chosen in this study, compared to previous studies of this type, was the inclusion of extractable Al with ammonium acetate indicator, which is strongly related to the inherent soil properties of these volcanic soils.","Carrasco, Jerman; Valle, Susana R.",,162,2018,,,

Possibilities to reduce tillage clayey soil have not been sufficiently investigated in Lithuania before. Research was carried out during 2014-2016 at the Joniskelis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry on a clay loam (siltic, drainic), Endocalcary-Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can) in the experiment, established in 2006. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effects of different tillage intensity as well as its combinations with supplementary agronomic practices (deep ploughing at 21-23 cm depth and shallow ploughless tillage at 10-12 cm depth as well as shallow ploughless tillage with incorporation of lime sludge and no-till in the autumn with a cover crop for winter mulch) on the indicators of soil physical state, investigated in a field pea crop. Ploughless tillage alone demonstrated the significantly higher soil water content before pre-sowing tillage in spring, higher soil dry bulk density, lower soil total porosity and soil water capacity before crop harvesting in topsoil; however, soil dry bulk density decreased, soil water capacity and soil total and air-filled porosity increased in the subsoil compared to deep ploughing. Incorporation of lime sludge (Ca-amendment) in the ploughless tillage plots resulted in higher soil water content before pre-sowing tillage, lower soil water content after crop emergence and before harvesting, higher air-filled porosity and amount of stable soil aggregates in topsoil, lower soil dry bulk density, higher total and air-filled porosity in subsoil before harvesting. Due to no-till in the autumn, with a cover crop for winter mulch, soil water content increased before pre-sowing tillage, it decreased after crop emergence and before harvesting in topsoil, soil dry bulk density decreased and total and air-filled porosity increased in subsoil; however, the amount of most agronomically valuable (0.25-5.6 mm) soil aggregates decreased in topsoil before harvesting compared to ploughing.","Satkus, Antanas; Velykis, Aleksandras",,105,2018,,,

Part I. Results of an Iranian soil,"This study investigated the impact of monovalent cations on clay dispersion, aggregate stability, soil pore size distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity on agricultural soil in Iran. The soil was incubated with treatment solutions containing different concentrations (0-54.4 mmol l(-1)) of potassium and sodium cations. The treatment solutions included two levels of electrical conductivity (EC= 3 or 6 dS m(-1)) and six K: Na ratios per electrical conductivity level. At both electrical conductivity levels, spontaneously dispersible clay increased with increasing K concentration, and with increasing K: Na ratio. A negative linear relationship between percentage of water-stable aggregates and spontaneously dispersible clay was observed. Clay dispersion generally reduced the mean pore size, presumably due to clogging of pores, resulting in increased water retention. At both electrical conductivity levels, hydraulic conductivity increased with increasing exchangeable potassium percentage at low exchangeable potassium percentage values, but decreased with further increases in exchangeable potassium percentage at higher exchangeable potassium percentage. This is in agreement with earlier studies, but seems in conflict with our data showing increasing spontaneously dispersible clay with increasing exchangeable potassium percentage. Our findings show that clay dispersion increased with increasing K concentration and increasing K: Na ratio, demonstrating that K can have negative impacts on soil structure.","Emami, Hojat; Farahani, Elham; Fotovat, Amir; Keller, Thomas; Khorassani, Reza",,32,2018,,,

Recently, the raised bed cultivation system has widely been used for blueberry cultivation, but it has a potential to cause nitrogen (N) losses via leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission especially with high rate of N application. We investigated the effects of organic amendments on N losses; via leaching ammonium ([image omitted]) and nitrate ([image omitted]) and N2O emission under acid soil conditions. The treatments were (i) ammonium sulfate application (AS), (ii) AS with peat moss (AS + PM), and (iii) AS with sawdust compost (AS + SD). A container (surface area: 47 cm x 40 cm = 0.188 m2) experiment to simulate raised bed cultivation system using an ochric Cambisol was conducted at Chiba University, Japan, during 2008 and 2009. A blueberry plant in each container received N fertilizer three times: 14.8, 23.8, and 14.8 g N m-2 in July 2008, March, and July 2009, respectively. Incorporation of peat moss and sawdust compost with ferrous sulfate effectively decreased soil pH to its optimal ranges (4.0-5.2) and resulted in increased growth and yield of blueberry (berry yield of 2009: 93, 285, and 348 g plant-1 in AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatment, respectively) due to increased soil porosity and consequently enhanced plant root biomass. Concurrently, the AS + SD treatment resulted in the least N losses, followed by AS + PM and AS treatment both through leaching and N2O emission. The emitted N2O amount over about two-year blueberry cultivation were 1.28, 0.80, and 0.58 g N m-2 for AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatments, respectively. These results indicated that application of organic amendments decreased N losses to the environment most likely due to increased plant N uptake, microbial N immobilization, and consequent reduction in nitrification, denitrification, and leaching.","Inubushi, Kazuyuki; Matsushima, Miwa; Tang, Changyuan; Vano, Imre",,57,2011,,,

No significant changes in soil properties were found when shrubland was changed to arboreal land. However, changing the fixed desertified land from shrub land to arable land and nursery garden decreased soil porosity, but significantly increased soil bulk density (BD), soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (TN) and available nutrients (N, P, K). Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN) and phosphorus (MBP), as well as microbial quotient (MBC/SOC, MBN/TN, MBP/TP), decreased significantly. No significant changes were detected in soil texture, total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK). Results of this study indicated that agricultural land use can improve the fertility of fixed desertified land; however, soil microbial biomass could decrease.

The three types of organic inputs (mulches) included: conifer compost, CC (100 m3 ha-1 every 3 years); conifer bark, CB (300 m3 ha-1 every 5 years); and cereal straw, S (10 t ha-1 every 2 years). The other two types of organic inputs were cover crops of clover (C) and fescue (F). The impacts of these organic inputs on soil organic carbon (SOC) content, wettability (capillary rise and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) and structural stability were studied. The SOC content was twice as large in the CC, C and F topsoils (SOC content of 2.56-3.24%) as in the reference (R) topsoil (SOC content of 1.39%). Both apparent contact angle (theta) and surface OH:C mass ratio indicated that the R and S topsoils were hydrophilic (theta of 27.4-33.4 degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 3.20-4.41), whereas the CB, C and F topsoils were partially hydrophobic (theta of 69.1-79.8 degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 1.36-2.86), and the CC topsoil had intermediate values (theta of 46.9 degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 2.43-2.81). Moreover, the greater the theta value, the smaller the water sorptivity value and the greater the proportion of water-stable aggregates, Ag(w). The increase in SOC content had beneficial effects on Ag(w), particularly for the partially hydrophobic C and F topsoils (Ag(w) of 22.3-44.5%) against the hydrophilic R and S topsoils (Ag(w) of 8.2-12.7%). Development of hydrophobicity, correlated with the decrease in the surface OH:C ratio and the increase in the C-O, C-N proportion on surface C, should be attributed to humified organic matter or/and to plant and microbial polysaccharides. As the XPS and aggregate stability data describe soil physical processes at small scales (nm to mm), we suggest an experimental and modelling framework for upscaling these results for practical improvement and management of vineyard soils.","Bartoli, F.; Dousset, S.",,62,2011,,,

Samples of a clay loam and clay soil were collected from the top 15 cm layer and amended with chickpea green or mature dry manure and incubated at 30 degrees C and similar to 60% water holding capacity. Decomposition intensity was determined by measuring CO2 evolution using NaOH traps, aggregate stability by wet sieving and Ksat by the constant head method.

Thus, single inversion tillage is customarily used for overcoming these drawbacks; however, the effects on the enhanced soil functions are unknown. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess whether improved soil physical properties following long-term reduced tillage remain after one-time inversion tillage by mouldboard plough. The study was undertaken on a silt loam field in Lower Saxony, Germany. Since 1996, this field has been subdivided into three treatments; one was managed conventionally using a mouldboard plough (CT), while on the others a chisel plough (RT1) and a disc harrow (RT2) were employed. In October 2014, the entire field was mouldboard ploughed. The following year, four field campaigns were conducted to compare the soil physical properties of the continuously conventional tilled plot with those affected by one-time inversion tillage (RT1 and RT2). Dry bulk density (DBD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and infiltration rate [K(h)] were analysed in untrafficked and trafficked areas in each plot. There were clear differences between CT and RT. At all sampling dates, both RT plots had higher Ks and K(h) compared with CT. These differences also occurred to some extent on the trafficked areas. This suggests that improved soil hydraulic properties remained after one-time inversion tillage of a long-term reduced tilled field. Thus, one-time inversion tillage may offer a suitable measure for overcoming some of the main disadvantages associated with long-term reduced tillage, while preserving the positive effects on soil physical properties.","Blaschek, M.; Brunotte, J.; Duttmann, R.; Kuhwald, M.",,33,2017,,,

Search has been prompted for agronomic strategies with lower environmental hazards. In this multidisciplinary study we compared the characteristics of soils from 20 agricultural farms selected in five geographical areas of Southern Italy with different soil types. In each farm, fields with management regime classified as high-input (HIMR, intensive cultivation under plastic tunnels) or low-input (LIMR, tree orchards) were selected. Soil samples were analyzed for 31 parameters including physical and chemical properties (bulk density, water holding capacity, texture, pH, limestone, electrical conductivity, organic Cm a depth of 0-20 and 20-40 cm, total N, P(2)O(5), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), Na(+), cation exchange capacity), enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase,arylsulphatase, beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and urease) and microbiological features (potential respiration, functional diversity of microbial populations by BIOLOG EcoPlates (TM), microbial biomass, fungal mycelium, culturable actinomycetes, bacteria and fungi, pseudomonads and bacterial species richness by 16S rDNA-DGGE). Finally, a soil bioassay was performed in order to evaluate the plant growth of a biotest plant (Lactuca sativa) and soil suppressiveness of the Rhizoctonia solani-L. sativa pathosystem. Results showed that many soil properties were influenced by management regime more than by the sampling area. Compared to LIMR, HIMR soils consistently had reduced soil organic C (-24%), enzymatic activities, microbial biomass and fungal mycelium (-40% and -18%, respectively), functional diversity (-18%) and bacterial species richness (-14%). On the contrary, the same soils showed a remarkable increase in the values of the parameters related to the mineral soil fraction (electrical conductivity +370%; P(2)O(5) +72%; Na(+) +86%). Management regime did not affect cation exchange capacity, pH, limestone and soil texture. The lettuce bioassay showed a higher plant growth (+17%) in the LIMR compared to HIMR soils, despite the lower content of mineral nutrients. Suppression of R. solani was not influenced by management regime, but significant differences were recorded among farms. Differences among the assessed soil parameters indicate a trend of soil quality deterioration under the high-input management regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The returned straws are expected to improve the fertility and structural stability of soil during the degradation of straw it selves. The in situ effect of different straw (wheat, rice, maize, rape, and broad bean) applications for soil aggregate stability and soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution were studied at both dry land soil and paddy soil in this study. Wet sieving procedures were used to separate soil aggregate sizes. Aggregate stability indicators including mean weight diameter, geometric mean diameter, mean weight of specific surface area, and the fractal dimension were used to evaluate soil aggregate stability after the incubation of straws returning. Meanwhile, the variation and distribution of SOC in different-sized aggregates were further studied. Results showed that the application of straws, especially rape straw at dry land soil and rice straw at paddy soil, increased the fractions of macro-aggregate (> 0.25 mm) and micro-aggregate (0.25-0.053 mm). Suggesting the nutrients released from straw degradation promotes the growing of soil aggregates directly and indirectly. The application of different straws increased the SOC content at both soils and the SOC mainly distributed at < 0.53 mm aggregates. However, the contribution of SOC in macro- and micro-aggregates increased. Straw-applied paddy soil have a higher total SOC content but lower SOC contents at > 0.25 and 0.25-0.053 mm aggregates with dry land soil. Rape straw in dry land and rice straw in paddy field could stabilize soil aggregates and increasing SOC contents best.","Gao, Ming; Huang, Rong; Lan, Muling; Liu, Jiang",,24,2017,,,

Two paddy plots identical in soil properties, developed to cultivate rice (Sali, grown in low-lying areas of Assam), were adjacent to each other to follow a conventional agricultural practice in one and conservation in the other. Two chambers (1 m x 0.6 m x 0.4 m) were placed in both the plots to collect runoff for analyzing CO2 concentrations. The results of the both practices have been inter-compared. For conservation plot, the SOC was high in the range from 3.17+0.01 kg m(-2) to 20.42 +/- 0.56 kg m(-2) and the CO2 emission was less, i.e. 97.30 +/- 7.11 mg m(-2) h(-1) as compared to 189.65 +/- 4.37 mg m-2 h-1 of the conventional plot. Low tillage practiced for the conservation plot facilitated higher porosity (50.11 +/- 8.40% to 88.87 +/- 3.59%) and greater water retention (47.47 +/- 1.15% to 10137 +/- 1.63%) in the soil. The results indicate that more tillage exposed the soil to atmospheric oxygen more, which leads to excess mineralization of organic carbon and emissions of CO2 as in the conventional plot.

The objectives of this study were to follow the biochemical changes occurring during composting of buffalo manure with and without earthworms during 3 months and to study the effect of the end products (compost and vermicompost) on soil biochemical parameters and plant growth after two months of incubation under controlled conditions in an open pot experiment. Our conceptual approach included characterisation of organic matter of the two composts before and after addition to soil by elemental, isotopic analysis and analytical pyrolysis and comparison with conventional fertilisation. We also analysed for lignin content and composition. Our results showed that composting in the presence of earthworms led to stronger transformation of buffalo manure than regular composting. Vermicompost was enriched in N-containing compounds and depleted in polysaccharides. It further contained stronger modified lignin compared to regular compost. In the bulk soil, the amendment of compost and vermicompost led to significant modification of the soil organic matter after 2 months of exposure to natural weather conditions. The lignin component of SOM was unaffected whatever the origin of the organic amendment. Compost and vermicompost amendments both enhanced aggregation and increased the amount of organic matter in water stable aggregates. However, vermicompost is preferable to compost due to its beneficial effect on plant growth, while having similar positive effects on quantity and quality of SOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As they can be cultivated on marginal soils, they reduce the risk of land use and food vs. fuel conflicts. In this study, we evaluated the perennial energy crop Sida hermaphrodita for its potential to be cultivated on marginal substrate and conventional agricultural soils over a three-year field and mesocosm experiment at agricultural conditions. Furthermore, we aimed for a closed nutrient loop by fertilizing plants with biogas digestate and using the carbon fraction of the digestate as soil amendment to ameliorate the overall soil fertility. As controls, plants were either untreated or fertilized with an equivalent amount of mineral NPK fertilizer. We found S. hermaphrodita to give highest DM yields of up to 28 t ha(-1) under favorable soil conditions when fertilized with mineral NPK. However, on marginal substrate digestate fertilization resulted in a clear biomass yield advantage over NPK fertilization. An increased soil carbon content, water holding capacity and basal soil respiration indicated improved soil fertility in the marginal substrate. These results demonstrate the great potential of S. hermaphrodita to be cultivated on marginal soil in combination with organic fertilization via biogas digestate.","Jablonowski, Nicolai D.; Koller, Robert; Nabel, Moritz; Poorter, Hendrik; Schrey, Silvia D.",,107,2017,,,

Among the factors affecting SOC pool and fluxes in a watershed, land use changes and soil erosion are factors of importance. The differences in SOC and its fractions among different land uses can help understand the process of soil carbon dynamics. A study was conducted in Typic Ustochrepts of Northwest India to understand the impact of forest, grassland, agricultural and eroded lands on aggregate stability and SOC fractions. The undisturbed soil aggregates were sampled from different land uses in a watershed in Shiwaliks of lower Himalayas. The aggregate stability was determined by shaking the pre-saturated aggregates under water and by single simulated raindrop technique. The SOC, labile carbon, hot-water soluble carbon, particulate organic carbon and aggregate associated organic carbon were determined in aggregates of different sizes as well as in the bulk soils. The water stability of aggregates expressed as mean weight diameter (MWD) and stability index (SI(SRT)) was highest in surface soils (0-15 cm) of grasslands followed by forest, agricultural and eroded lands. The WSA > 2 mm (water stable aggregates > 2 mm) were highest (17.3%) in grasslands and lowest (0.85%) in eroded lands. The eroded soils had 2.2, 7.4 and 3.4 times higher amount of micro-aggregates (WSA < 0.25 mm) than agricultural, forest and grassland soils, respectively. The SOC in surface soils significantly decreased by 27% in forest and 45% in agricultural land from that in grassland soils. In subsoil (15-30 cm), the SOC in eroded, agricultural and grasslands was statistically similar. The SOC stock in the subsoil (15-100 cm) was of significance. The grassland soils could store 41 Mg ha(-1) SOC stock compared to 31 Mg ha(-1) in the subsurface layer. This difference widened in forestland, where subsoil contained 73.4% of total SOC stock in 100 cm soil profile. Among all the SOC fractions studied, labile carbon was mostly affected by erosion and was 91.6% lower in eroded than in grassland soils. The magnitude of aggregate associated organic carbon decreased with aggregate size in all the land uses. Among the SOC fractions, the aggregate stability under simulated raindrop impact could better be explained (R (2) = 0.78) by hot water soluble carbon whereas the water stability of aggregate could better be explained (R (2) = 0.69) by particulate organic carbon.","Kukal, S.

Among the many agrochemicals used, glyphosate-based herbicides raised controversy, encouraging research to clarify if the benefits of their use outweigh their alleged harmfulness. In this spirit, this study assessed soil quality indicators on glyphosate-sprayed fields under natural (NC) and zero tillage conditions (ZT) in Northwest Argentina, to analyze the effect of the herbicide application on soil degradation. The ZT soils underwent five years of continuous spraying (2-4 times a year) after land clearing, while the NC soil, without any laboring practices, was subjected to two consecutive applications. Among the measured indicators (physical, chemical, and biological), water-stable aggregates (WSA), particulate organic matter (POM) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) showed quality differences between ZT and NC samples. The highest values were found in NC (WSA 72%; POM 4.9%; DHA 1460 mg TPF/g(soil)/d) and the lowest in ZT (WSA 13%; POM 1.69%; DHA 180 mg TPF/g(soil)/d); showing a lower quality in ZT regarding structure stability, nutrient availability and microbial activity. A Discriminant Analysis revealed that as glyphosate application increased, the overall soil quality decreased within the NC samples, resembling that of ZT. Thus, soil health deterioration was attributed solely to glyphosate spraying in NC. Furthermore, multivariate analysis allowed identification of chemical indicators as of higher sensitivity to the short-term response after application, and biological indicators as more sensitive to long-term changes. The quality decline in time in the NC soil, caused by the use of glyphosate-based herbicides, could endanger the soils sustainability.","Amoroso, Maria J.; Rajal, Veronica B.; Romano-Armada, Neli",,36,2017,,,

In this study, soil properties were assessed under various cultivation regimes of different crops, including legumes, grass, and nursery natural rubber (NR) trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.), in southern Vietnam. The crops studied had all been growing for 7 years commencing in 1999, on light-textured Acrisols. Soils under the cultivation regime of creeping legumes including Calopogonium caeruleum, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Stylosanthes gracilis had significantly higher carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and porosity than soils under the other management types studied. Soils under Brachiaria ruziziensis and P. phaseoloides had the highest aggregate stability. Cultivation regimes with tillage, field traffic, and inorganic fertilisers applied to nursery NR trees increased phosphorus (P) availability, but this was accompanied by increased soil compaction and reductions in most of the other soil properties analysed. Relative to the nursery NR cultivation, creeping-legume cultivation increased soil C concentration (by 95%), soil pH(H2O) (by 19%), macro-aggregates (by 29%), and porosity (by 8%). From principal component analysis, three soil properties-soil organic carbon (SOC), porosity, and P availability-were selected as key indicators suitable for the evaluation of the effects of cultivation on soils. Establishment of C. caeruleum and B. ruziziensis was most effective in improving soil C content, and soil porosity was significantly higher under C. caeruleum and P. phaseoloides. These findings suggest that each cover crop had its own dominant agro-characteristics and that selection of a cover crop to either improve soil fertility or reduce compaction should be considered by farmers in this region.","Duong, Tra Thanh; Hoa, Hai Thien; Ngo, Van Thi Hong; Nguyen, Binh Thanh; Wilson, Brian R.",,49,2011,,,

Nevertheless, elevated amounts of agricultural lime in Oxisols, with or without cultural residue addition, could alter soil physicochemical properties and impact soil structure. In this context, the physical, chemical, and structural behaviors of an Oxisol under the addition of lime and straw were assessed. Lime doses (0, 3.9, 7.8, and 15.6 Mg ha(-1)) were either applied on the surface or incorporated into the 0-to 5-cm soil layer. Straw applications followed the same procedure with quantities of 0, 4, 12, or 16 Mg ha(-1). The effects on the soil profile were evaluated through physicochemical (specific surface area,. potential, and pH), physical (density, penetration resistance, water dispersible clay, and total porosity), and micromorphological properties (surface area, volume, connectivity, size, and pore anisotropy) 1 yr after soil incubation in polyvinyl chloride cylinders 30 cm long and 14.5 cm in diameter. Lime application on the surface or into the 0-to 5-cm layer increased soil pH to values above 7.0 and the electronegative potential of soil colloid surface, promoting clay dispersion. Water-dispersed clay migrated in the soil profile, causing pore obstruction, and higher soil density and penetration resistance. In addition, excessive lime decreased specific surface area, anisotropy degree and the connectivity of the soil pore system. Straw addition promoted a slight increase of colloids electronegative potential but did not alter soil physical properties.","Denardin, Jose E.; Libardi, Paulo L.; Nunes, Marcio R.; Vaz, Carlos M.

A study was conducted at the Agricultural Research Centre, Kpong, to assess the suitability of Mucuna pruriens, Mimosa invisa and Stylosanthes guianensis, in short fallows, for improving the fertility, physical properties, moisture conservation and weed control in the case of these soils. Mucuna had the highest biomass of 5.3tha(-1), as opposed to 4.1tha(-1) under natural fallow. The mucuna and stylosanthes biomass had comparatively higher total N values (240.75 and 203.51kgha(-1), respectively) than mimosa and natural fallow (152.46 and 162.74kgha(-1), respectively). Soil organic carbon, one year after the incorporation of cover crops, was found to be relatively higher under the cover crops (mucuna, stylosanthes and mimosa) than it was under natural fallow. Bulk densities were thus lower under the cover crops than they were under natural fallow. Also, soils under the cover crops had higher total porosity, water infiltration rates and moisture storage than they did under natural fallow. Weed cover, 115 days after planting maize, was significantly lower in plots previously under Mucuna pruriens than it was under natural fallow, Stylosanthes guianensis and Mimosa invisa. There was a negative linear correlation between cover crop biomass and weed density (R(2) = 0.593-0.805). Grain and stover yields of maize were higher under Mucuna pruriens than they were under natural fallow (138 and 70 per cent higher, respectively). Burning of the natural fallow resulted in greater weed growth than when the material was worked into the soil (41 and 8 per cent, respectively).

Many marginal zones grazed for centuries are now suffering from abandonment, which has been found to be interrelated with species and functional diversity loss, and has potential consequences for the provision of ecosystem services such as soil fertility and soil carbon storage. We sampled soil and plant species abundance in a total of 64 plots (5 x 5 m), in wet and dry habitats under different grazing regimes (from moderate grazing to grazing abandonment for at least 30 years) in Central Spain. We tested the influence of grazing intensity and water availability on different variables related to soil fertility and also on soil carbon storage. In addition, Community weighted mean and Rao quadratic entropy were calculated for two effect traits (specific leaf area and plant height), in order to assess the ultimate effects of these functional attributes on multifunctionality (i.e., the provision of several simultaneous ecosystem functions). We found that grazing abandonment generally produces a reduction in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available potassium and phosphorus, aggregate stability and soil carbon storage. In addition, grazing abandonment had a negative effect on soil texture with loss of fine particles (clay and silt) and water holding capacity, but only in dry habitats and in longer-term abandoned situation. In general, soil multifunctionality was higher in wet than dry habitats, decreased with grazing abandonment in both habitats. Soil multifunctionality was indirectly mediated by the functional structure of size and leaf traits of the local plant communities, but our results suggested that macroscale grazing effects, i.e. translocation of nutrients by grazers among habitats via dung and urine deposition, might be important mechanisms that influence soil multifunctionality at the local level. Agri-environmental policies should be aware of the risk of widespread grazing abandonment and take advantage of the benefits of low-intensity grazing regimes for ecosystem services such as soil fertility and stability, and soil carbon storage.","Carmona, C.

The experimental design was completely randomized plots with three replicates, representing conventional tillage with residue incorporated into soil (CT1), conventional tillage with residue burned (CT2), reduced tillage with heavy tandem disc harrow (RT1), reduced tillage with rotary tiller (RT2), reduced tillage with heavy tandem disc harrow followed by no-till (RT3) and no-till (NT) in Arik Clay (Typic Haploxererts) in southern Anatolia of Turkey. In each plot, five infiltration tests were conducted using double-ring constant-water-level infiltrometers. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and the means of treatments were grouped by LSD technique. Both RT and NT decreased infiltration rate (IR), significantly, and this was attributed to decreased total and macroporosity together with high proportion of swelling clays. Furthermore, residue burning decreased infiltration rate significantly compared to residue incorporated soils in conventionally tilled soils, and this was attributed to decreased total porosity and macroporosity in the former. Arik clay series is one of the largest soil series intensively used for agriculture on level to slightly sloping landscapes of Southeastern region of Turkey. Therefore, the results suggest that reduced and no-tillage should be applied cautiously in Arik series soils to avoid problems such as water loss by runoff in sloping areas and water logging in level areas.

In this study we developed SQI using minimum data set (MDS) and determined the response of SQI to long-term tillage systems. Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown in alternate years at northwestern China, and soil attributes and crop productivity were measured 6 years after the initiation of the experiment. The MDS used to develop the SQI included soil physical (aggregate, bulk density, capillary porosity, field capacity'), chemical (soil organic matter. total nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium) and biological (microbial count, microbial biomass, and the activities of catalase, urease, alkaline phosphatase, and invertase) properties. All the property variables were measured in each of the 0-5, 5-10 and 10-30 cm depths and those variables that contributed significantly to the SQI were selected to be included in the MDS. Amongst the measured variables, bulk density and microbial counts occurred in the MDS of all the three depths, suggesting that these two properties are highly affected by the tillage treatments. In the long-term field experiment, the no-till with stubble covering the soil surface treatment received the greatest SQI score and achieved the highest crop yield. Soil quality under tillage systems can be assessed adequately using MDS measured at the top soil (0-5 cm) layer in rainfed agro-ecosystems.","Cai, Liqun; Gan, Yantai; Li, Lingling; Luo, Zhuzhu; Niu, Yining; Xie, Junhong; Zhang, Renzhi",,53,2017,,,

In recent years, integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM), which uses crop models and advanced nutrient management to redesign cropping systems, has been successfully demonstrated to achieve both high crop productivity and high nutrient use efficiency in China, but the effects of ISSM on soil organic C (SOC) characteristics remain unknown. In this study, the effects of current farmers' practice (FP), high-yielding practice (BY), which maximizes yields without considering costs, and ISSM on the content and chemical composition of SOC were studied in a 4-year (2009-2013) field plot experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture in an Alluvic Primosol in Northeast China. The ISSM resulted in higher soil total organic C (TOC), water-soluble organic C, easily-oxidizable organic C, particulate organic C, and humic acid C compared with HY and FP in the region. The SOC contents in aggregate size fractions generally followed a similar pattern to TOC.,Compared with FP, HY decreased the mean weight diameter, geometric mean diameter, percentage of > 0.25-mm water-stable aggregates, and the stability ratio of water-stable aggregates, and increased the structure-deterioration rate and index of unstable aggregates. The opposite trend was observed between ISSM and HY. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of bulk soil showed that ISSM had higher O-alkyl C and aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio, but lower aromatic C, carbonyl C, and alkyl C/O-alkyl C and hydrophobic C/hydrophilic C ratios than HY and FP. Our results suggest that ISSM improves the quantity and quality of SOC and has a positive effect on soil aggregation and aggregate stability.","Cuilan, Li; Guozhong, Feng; Jinjing, Zhang; Lichun, Wang; Mengyao, Li; Qiang, Gao; Zhiyuan, Cao",,27,2017,,,

Consequently, both poultry producers and PL users have to meet strict state and federal guidelines on litter storage and land application. This study examined the environmental benefits of adding lime, alum, ferrous sulfate, fly ash (FA), fluidized bed ash (FBA) and soil fix (SF) to PL for immobilizing excess phosphorus (P) while providing sufficient nutrients for proper growth of soybean [Glycine max (L.)] and corn [Zea mays (L.)] on a rotation. Amending PL with lime, alum, SF, FA and FBA significantly (p0.05) increased corn and soybean yield. In contrast control plots that received a 10-10-10 (N-P2O5-K2) fertilizer showed lower yield and corn quality. Increased yield was observed when PL was amended with lime, alum and ferrous sulfate. Results from a soybean root, shoot, and nodule growth study indicated variability with respect to PL application and amendment use. Smaller size nodules were obtained with NPK fertilizer and PL plus lime treated plots, whereas PL with alum yielded fewer but larger nodules. Soil aggregation was significantly lower in soils treated with NPK compared to those treated with PL as indicated by water stable aggregation (WSA), mean aggregate diameter (MWD) and geometric mean of aggregate diameter (GMD) (p0.05). Increased soil aggregation was a result of the combined effect of amendment and PL additions rather than PL alone. The amount of carbon (C) in soil aggregates was lowest with NPK and highest with PL treatments. In the presence of PL, alum and iron treatments showed higher capacities to store C and immobilize P in macro-aggregates (8 to 5 mm diameter). These results suggest that soil treatment with PL and chemical amendments, especially alum and ferrous sulfate, could result in improved crop yield, soil aggregation, carbon storage, and P immobilization.","Atalay, Asmare; Bronick, Carol; Mebrahtu, Tadesse; Whitehead, Brodie",,35,2011,,,

The effect of management practices on the recovery of the aggregation of a physically degraded soil was studied based on the distribution of water-stable aggregates and single particles (diameter classes 9.51-4,76, 4.76-2.00, 2.00-0.25, 0.25-0.053, < 0.053 mm) and carbon stock (C) in the surface layer (0-7.5 cm) of a Paleudult in the Central Depression region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, under different management systems. The following systems were evaluated in experimental plots after 17 years: soil without plants and without tillage (fallow); no-till Lablab purpureus and maize (Zea mays) (Lablab / m); Cajanus cajan (peal m) and maize; perennial pasture of Digitaria decumbens (Pangola grass). The following systems were evaluated after 15 years: conventional tillage and no-till Avena strigosa and maize (CT a/m and NT a/m, respectively) Avena strigosa + Vicia sativa and maize + Vigna unguiculata (CT av / mu and NT av / mu, respectively). A conventionally tilled area was also evaluated after 30 years of grain cultivation (crop) and native grassland (NGr), representing the degraded state and the native ecosystem of this soil, respectively. Undisturbed soil samples collected in two seasons (September 1999 to September 2000) were evaluated in six replications per management system. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test (5 %) to detect differences between management systems. In the NGr, 76.4 % of the soil aggregates consisted of 63.8 % macroaggregates and of 23.6 % of single particles, and a C stock of 20.0 Mg ha(-1). The agricultural use with intense soil tillage and low residue application (crop) reduced the proportion of soil aggregates to 49.9 % and raised single particles to 50.1 %, while the C stock decreased to 11.8 Mg ha(-1). From this condition, 15 years of the untilled system with greater diversity of plant species and high residue application (NT au I mc) raised the proportion of soil aggregates to 70.7% and of macroaggregates to 53.5 %. Perennial pasture (Pangola) increased the proportion of soil aggregates to 74.1 % and of macroaggregates to 61.8 %, equaling NGr. The systems NT av / mc, pea / m and Lablab / m recovered C stocks to the level of NGr. Although Pangola had the highest soil aggregation rates, the C stock was lower than in the said systems, emphasizing the positive action of a dense root system in the recovery of soil aggregation.","Mielniczuk, Joao; Vezzani, Fabiane Machado",,35,2011,,,

This study compared conservation agriculture (CA) practices (no-tillage, cover crop and residue retention) and conventional intensive tillage system in order to evaluate their effects on total porosity, pore size distribution, pore architecture and morphology. The experiment was set up in 2010 on four farms of the low-lying Veneto Region plain characterized by silty soils. Almost hundred soil samples were collected in 2015 at four depths down to 50-cm layer and investigated for porosity from micrometre (0.0074 mu m) to macrometre (2.5 mm) by coupling mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray computed microtomography (mu CT). Indices of soil morphology and architecture were derived by analysing 3D images and mercury intrusion porosimetry pore size curves. Results suggested that silty soils of Veneto plain are microstructured because much (82%) of the porosity ranged between 0.0074 and 30 ae m. CA practices positively influenced the ultramicroporosity class (0.1-5 mu m) (1.86E-01 vs 1.67E-01 mu m(3) mu m(-3)) that is strictly linked to soil organic carbon stabilization while no effects were observed in X-ray mu CT porosity domain (> 26 mu m). Silty soils of Veneto plain showed a slow reaction to CA because of the poor aggregate stability and low soil organic carbon. However, the positive response of the ultramicropore fraction indicates that a virtuous cycle was initiated between soil organic carbon and porosity, hopefully leading to well-developed macropore systems and, in turn, enhanced soil functions and ecosystem services.

This study evaluated the effect of two tillage systems (conventional tillage, CT vs. NT) on total SOC content, SOC concentration, water stable aggregate-size distribution and aggregate carbon concentration from 0 to 40 cm soil depth. Three tillage experiments were chosen, all located in northeast Spain and using contrasting tillage types but with different lengths of time since their establishment (20, 17, and 1-yr). In the two fields with mouldboard ploughing as CT, NT sequestered more SOC in the 0-5 cm layer compared with CT. However, despite there being no significant differences, SOC tended to accumulate under CT compared with NT in the 20-30 and 30-40 cm depths in the AG-17 field with 25-50% higher SOC content in CT compared with NT. Greater amounts of large and small macroaggregates under NT compared with CT were measured at 0-5 cm depth in AG-17 and at 5-10 cm in both AG-1 and AG-17. Differences in macroaggregate C concentration between tillage treatments were only found in the AG-17 field at the soil surface with 19.5 and 11.6 g C/kg macroaggregates in NT and CT, respectively. After 17 yr of experiment, CT with mouldboard ploughing resulted in a greater total SOC concentration and macroaggregate C concentration below 20 cm depth, but similar macroaggregate content compared with NT. This study emphasizes the need for adopting whole-soil profile approaches when studying the suitability of NT versus CT for SOC sequestration and CO(2) offsetting.","Alvaro-Fuentes, J.; Cantero-Martinez, C.; Plaza-Bonilla, D.",,26,2010,,,

Our objective was to investigate the changes in the soil carbon pool and soil properties of surface soil (0-15 cm) under different types of rehabilitation management. Our study was done in the short-term (7 years) and long-term (32 years) desertification control sites in a marginal oasis of northwest China. The different management treatments were: (1) untreated shifting sand land as control; (2) sand-fixing shrubs with straw checkerboards; (3) poplar (Populus gansuensis) shelter forest; and (4) irrigated cropland after leveling sand dune. The results showed that the rehabilitation of severe sandy desertified land resulted in significant increases in soil organic C (SOC), inorganic C, and total N concentrations, as well as enhanced soil aggregation. Over a 7-year period of revegetation and cultivation, SOC concentration in the recovered shrub land, forest land and irrigated cropland increased by 4.1, 14.6 and 11.9 times compared to the control site (shifting sand land), and increased by 11.2, 17.0 and 23.0 times over the 32-year recovery period. Total N, labile C (KMnO4-oxidation C), C management index (CMI) and inorganic C (CaCO3-C) showed a similar increasing trend as SOC. The increased soil C and N was positively related to the accumulation of fine particle fractions. The accumulation of silt and clay, soil C and CaCO3 enhanced the formation of aggregates, which was beneficial to mitigate wind erosion. The percentage of >0.25 mm dry aggregates increased from 18.0% in the control site to 20.0-87.2% in the recovery sites, and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates significantly increased, with a range of 0.09-0.30 mm at the recovery sites. Long-term irrigation and fertilization led to a greater soil C and N accumulation in cropland than in shrub and forest lands. The amount of soil C sequestration reached up to 1.8-9.4 and 7.5-17.3 Mg ha(-1) at the 0-15 cm layer over a 7- and 32-year rehabilitation period compared to the control site, suggesting that desertification control has a great potential for sequestering soil C and improving soil quality in northwest China.

Identifying and understanding the many interactions occurring within agricultural systems is fundamental for accomplishing this feat. This paper synthesizes 14 years of research results from a study that began in the early 1990s in which researchers from USDA-ARS and the University of Georgia investigated cropping system influences on nutrient management under natural rainfall. Increases in C and N with no-till resulted in improved soil structure that increased infiltration rate and soil water availability. Biological activity as indicated by earthworms was greater with no-till and poultry litter (PL). In all but the very driest year, yields of cotton and corn increased on average 10-27% with no-till and 32-42% with combination of no-till and PL. On the other hand soil nutrient accumulation, particularly P and Zn from long-term use of poultry litter in corn production, reached excessive levels and could present environmental risks. Drainage increased in no-till raising the risk of leaching of nutrients into the soil profile. However, runoff decreased in no-till and the presence of a rye cover crop during the winter reduced the leaching losses of N compared to no cover crop. During cotton production under relative drought, no-till and poultry litter led to somewhat elevated dissolved phosphorus concentration in runoff, and fluometuron was detected in runoff and drainage while pendimethalin was not. Fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal enterococci), and the hormones estradiol and testosterone were observed in drainage and runoff but concentrations were similar across all treatments. By conducting the study for an extended period under natural environmental conditions, we were able to highlight real risks and potentials of the contrasting cropping systems. While 6 out of 14 years of relative drought might have limited the water quality response of treatments, such droughts are common features of the weather pattern in the region. Even then, use of no-till as the predominant tillage system was supported by improved yields. Fertilizer management, especially crop N need-based use of PL, requires closer monitoring to insure that production advantages of no-till and poultry litter are not offset by concerns with environmental risks. Long-term research requires sustained resource inputs to answer critical questions of environmental risk and emerging unknown issues.","Endale, Dinku M.; Fisher, Dwight S.; Franklin, Dory H.; Jenkins, Michael B.; Schomberg, Harry H.",,88,2010,,,

Effects on soil pore and gas transport characteristics in North-eastern Italy,"Soil air exchange is one of the most important soil functions that directly impacts on crop productivity and environment. Generally, conservation agriculture (CA) practices are expected to provide improved soil aeration but contrasting texture-related effects were found in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CA practices on gas transport characteristics in the silty soils of the Veneto Region (North-Eastern Italy). In 2010, a field experiment comparing CA practices (no-tillage, cover crop and residues retention) to conventional intensive tillage (IT) system was established in four farms located in the Veneto low plain. In fall 2015, 144 undisturbed 100 cm(3) soil cores where collected at two different layers (3-6.5 cm and 20-23.5 cm) and analysed for air-filled porosity, air permeability, gas diffusivity and soil structure indices derived. Gas transport measurements highlighted low transmission properties of the silty soils independently from agronomic management. Both air permeability and relative gas diffusivity showed poor aerated conditions being generally < 20 mu m(2) and < 0.005, respectively. CA treatments affected the transmission properties only in the coarsest soil studied causing a reduction of air permeability in the deeper layer and relative gas diffusivity in both layers. The CA-induced reduction was related to the tillage effect on soil bulk density and suggested that CA not only affected the air-filled porosity but also continuity and tortuosity characteristics. The poor structural stability of Veneto soils, particularly the poor soil organic carbon content, could prevent the exploitation of CA practices firstly on soil structure and in turn on gas exchanges. For these reasons further studies elucidating the mechanisms improving soil structural conditions for silty soils as those examined in this study are required.","Furlan, L.; Lamande, M.; Morari, F.; Piccoli, I.; Schjonning, P.",,172,2017,,,

The reported experiments were designed to study the effect of soil organic matter (SOM) from green manure crops on soil physical properties in two contrasting soils, sandy clay loam and loamy sand under the severe conditions of high temperature and low rainfall that exist in the eastern wheat belt of Western Australia. To remove soil physical and chemical constraints, the soils were deep ripped to 0.4 m after the application of 2.5 t/ha of gypsum. Basal fertilizers were applied according to soil tests to remove possible nutrient deficiencies. Cereals and legume crops were incorporated by disc cultivation into the soils as green manure for four consecutive years. Two plant groups, cereals and legumes were used to provide green manure. Oat (Avena sativa) as a cereal with high C:N ratio (95) and either faba bean (Vicia faba), field pea (Pisum sativum) or lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) were used as legumes with low C: N ratios (12 - 18). These crops were arranged in three treatments for each soil type consisting of different crop sequences. A total of between 14 and 20 t/ha of green material was incorporated into the top soil over four years. All treatments increased soil organic matter significantly compared to the initial soil values but no significant differences between treatments (crop sequences) were observed. Water stable aggregates and soil bulk density were significantly improved by all treatments but no significant differences were observed between treatments. Soil water infiltration was not significantly increased by the green manure treatments after ripping and gypsum addition, though it was significantly different between treatments. The SOM increased from around 1.28 to 1.96%, well below the critical value suggested in the literature for more humid areas to sustain healthy soil, and not as high as expected from the high quantity of green material returned to the soil. However, the levels of organic carbon increase were comparable with those predicted from a CSIRO carbon model.

The objective of this work was to verify if the simultaneous use of the information obtained from tension infiltrometers and water release curves contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of different long-term management systems on the pore space of agricultural soils. The study was carried out on the Flat Pampa in Santa Fe, Argentina, in two types of typical Argiudolls with a silty-loam surface soil texture. The following treatments were evaluated: a) no-till with corn-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) conventional tillage with wheat/soybean sequence (CT-S) at Galvez: and a) no-till with corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) no-till with wheat/soybean sequence (NT-S) at Videla. Tension values of 0, 1.5 and 3 cm were applied using tension infiltrometers with the aim of obtaining soil hydraulic conductivity measurements (K(0), K(1.5), and K(3)), and several hydraulic parameters (pore size, pore number, effective macroporosity, conducting macroporosity (epsilon((a,b))), water flow and water flow decrease). Undisturbed soil cores were collected to determine water release curves (WRC) and soil bulk density (Db). The total macroporosity (Ma) and pore size frequency curve were determined from the fitted model of the WRC. Macropore connectivity was calculated using epsilon((a,b)) and Ma. In Galvez, the Db values. K at all tensions, the number of effective pores, the mean pore radius and the effective macroporosity were significantly higher for NT-R. The conducting and total macroporosity values were similar in NT-R and CT-S, but the pores had better continuity in NT-R. In Videla, only K(0) and K(1.5) showed statistical differences in favor of NT-R. This treatment also had a greater number of effective pores, and higher effective, conducting and total macroporosity values, apart from the overall better pore connectivity. There were no significant differences between the NT-R and CT-S for Db and K(3). The evaluated indicators determined that the pore network characteristics are affected not only by tillage system, but also by the crops chosen for the rotation. When used jointly, tension infiltrometers and water release curves can be very useful tools for monitoring the evolution of the soils physical conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Conservation tillage and residue mulching play an important role in protecting and improving soil quality. A 4-year study was conducted in Meghalaya, India, involving maize (Zea mays L.)-rapeseed (Brassica campestris L.) cropping system, to evaluate the impact of no till (NT) and mulching on productivity of maize-rapeseed system and to assess the effect of management on soil organic carbon (SOC) and quality. Two tillage practices, conventional tillage (CT) and NT, were compared under six mulching rates: control (no mulching); M, maize stover retention; MA5, M + ragweed (RW; Ambrosia artemisiifolia) 5 Mg ha(-1); MA10, M + RW 10 Mg ha(-1); MF10, M + farmyard manure 10 Mg ha(-1); and MA5P5, M + RW 5 Mg ha(-1) + poultry manure 5 Mg ha(-1). Grain yields of maize and rapeseed under CT were similar to those under NT. Mulching had a significant effect on the productivity of maize and rapeseed. Mulching treatment MA5P5, MF10 and MA10 produced significantly (p = 0.05) higher yield of maize and rapeseed than that of other treatments. Maize and rapeseed productivity under control was the lowest. There was a marked increase in SOC concentration (8.4%), water stable aggregates (9.3%), mean weight diameter (42.6%) and soil microbial biomass carbon (66.8%) under NT, with respect to CT. Mulching treatment MA5P5 enhanced mean SOC concentration by 30.4% and mean weight diameter by 100% compared with those under control. Thus, NT and mulching are recommended measures for protecting soil and improving its quality in the studied area.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effect of different uses: savannah, grasses, pinus and eucalyptus, in different depth on soil properties of a red-yellow Latossol. The soil properties evaluated were: aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, bulk and particle density and porosity. The results showed that there was effect of the different plant covers in the depth on all soil properties studied. The mean weight diameter (DMP), in general, was lower at layer of 20-30 cm, with exception of pinus area which showed similar results in all layers. The DMP at savannah area showed lower values from layer of 10-20 cm. Soil organic carbon was higher at layer 0-5 cm and similar in the other soil layers for all plant covers. The bulk density (Ds) was higher and the particle density (Dp) was lower on soil under grasses. In layer of 0-5 cm the Dp was lower in the all plant covers. Soil porosity decreased from layer of 10-20 cm for all plant covers, with exception of grasses which had similar soil porosity at all studied soil layers.","Albernaz Vieira, Debora de Faria; Gerosa Ramos, Maria Lucrecia; Kato, Eiyti; Meira, Anete Dutra; Mourao, Viviane Coutinho",,26,2010,,,

In this study, a total of 105 different points in 35 different locations comprising of the 3 land uses were sampled in the study areas. Random sampling pattern of 3 sampling points per sample location were carried out and undisturbed soil samples were collected at depths up to 15 cm from the different locations. Handheld mini disk infiltrometer at a steady-state flow of 2 cm water suction rate was used to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, water and ethanol sorptivity at each land use site. In addition, the effects of antecedent soil moisture contents (MC), soil bulk density (BD), total porosity (FT), soil water holding capacity (WHC), organic matter content (SOM), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) on soil hydrophobicity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity were determined. The mean hydrophobicity index, R, showed a decreasing trend in the order: natural forest (>) plantation agriculture(>) croplands, whereas, mean hydraulic conductivity values showed an increasing trend in the order: natural forest < plantation agriculture < croplands. Hydraulic conductivity resulted to a negative correlation with hydrophobicity among all sampled soils. In all the sampled soils, index of soil hydrophobicity (R) correlated significantly (p <= 0.01) with organic matter content, organic carbon and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Soil sorptivity to water correlated negatively with moisture content among all samples at p <= 0.05. Soil ethanol sorptivity showed significantly positive correlation with organic carbon, organic matter content and cation exchange capacity among all the soil samples at a p <= 0.05. Soil properties such as organic matter content, bulk density, and aggregate sizes influence the infiltration characteristics of soils of the study areas.

However, no-tillage in a long-term may produce some undesirable soil characteristics. An occasional tillage operation has been used as a mean to manage some of the defects that have emerged in NT farming systems. This study was to explore the effect of sub-soiling at different frequencies in a no-tillage farming system of an annual cropping system of winter wheat-spring maize rotation on Loess Plateau. The study consisted of three tillage practices: NT (no-tillage were applied every year), NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first year and rotated with sub-soiling in second year), NT/NT/ST (no-tillage were applied in first two year and rotated with sub-soiling in third year). The study began in 2007 on a former spring maize field with conventional tillage and lasted for three-year rotation cycles by 2016. In ten years, for the soil physical properties, NT/ST rotation significantly decreased soil bulk density, and increased soil porosity and amount of macroaggregates ( > 0.25 mm) when compared to NT (P < 0.05). For water storage, NT with ST rotations (NT/ST &NT/NT/ST) increased the soil water storage in the fallow periods. Moreover, NT/ST rotation produced higher average grain yields, WUE and economic profit in the winter wheat-spring maize cropping system when compared to NT over the ten years. However, the soil organic matter (SOM) and total N under NT with ST rotations (NT/ST & NT/NT/ ST) were lower than it for NT. For this long-term experiment, NT provided a better soil nutrient condition, NT/ NT/ST and NT/ST rotation showed a better effect on soil water storage in fallow. For the comprehensive productivity, NT/ST rotation showed a balanced soil properties and crop production effect among three tillage treatments. In the winter wheat-spring maize cropping system, NT/ST rotation enhanced soil physical and chemical properties and increased yield and water holding capacity of soil. We predict that the NT/ST rotation will be of great significance in promoting the development of rain-fed conservation farming in the Loess Plateau of China.","Jia, Guangcan; Li, Jun; Wang, Hao; Wang, Rui; Wang, Shulan; Wang, Xiaoli; Xu, Zonggui; Zhang, Yujiao",,209,2017,,,

However, the effect of organic waste fertilizers on colloid dispersibility and leaching of colloids from topsoil has not yet been studied extensively. We investigated how the repeated application of different types of agricultural (liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure) and urban waste fertilizers (sewage sludge and composted organic household waste) affected soil physical properties, colloid dispersion from aggregates, tracer transport, and colloid leaching from intact soil cores. Total porosity was positively correlated with SOC content. Yearly applications of sewage sludge increased absolute microporosity (pores <30 mu m) and decreased relative macroporosity (pores >30 mu m) compared with the unfertilized control, whereas organic household waste compost fertilization increased both total porosity and the absolute porosity in all pore size classes (though not significant for 100-600 mu m). Treatments receiving large amounts of organic fertilizers exhibited significantly lower levels of dispersible colloids compared with an unfertilized control and a treatment that had received moderate applications of cattle slurry. The content of water-dispersible colloids could not be explained by a single factor, but differences in SOC content, electrical conductivity, and sodium adsorption ratio were important factors. Moreover, we found that the fertilizer treatments did not significantly affect the solute transport properties of the topsoil. Finally, we found that the leaching of soil colloids was significantly decreased in treatments that had received large amounts of organic waste fertilizers, and we ascribe this primarily to treatment-induced differences in effluent electrical conductivity during leaching.","Kjaergaard, Charlotte; Lekfeldt, Jonas Duus Stevens; Magid, Jakob",,46,2017,,,

Soil samples from eight fertilizer treatments (mineral fertilizers and PS), applied over seven growing seasons were analysed. We applied five methodologies to examine different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown. Porosity was characterized by image analyses. There was minimum resistance to the mechanical breakdown of aggregates when slurries had been applied 12 months before analysis. Recent applications of slurry (3 months before the analysis) improved resistance to implosion caused by the penetration of water into dry aggregates (slaking), although the opposite result can occur if the method of evaluation is not chosen properly. Recent applications of PS also enhanced soil respiration and increased soil porosity in the 25-100-mu m size range (packing pores between aggregates) and in the 100-400-mu m size range (interaggregate or faunal pores). In dryland systems and in the winter cereal cropping season, the resistance of dry aggregates to slaking is improved temporarily if PS is applied at N rates equivalent to around 1.7 MgOM ha(-1) year(-1).","Boixadera, J.; Bosch-Serra, A.

Large-area degradation of surface soils in Europe is a major challenge to maintain and remediate due to their size and geomorphology, different historical uses and current biogeochemical conditions. These sites are often degraded with a mixture of contaminants mostly lacking a biologically active topsoil. The use of sewage sludge to restore such sites with soil organic matter and stabile plant cover have for long been explored, but the application is restricted by the chemical quality of the sewage sludge. Hence we designed a study to investigate the effect of a one-time amendment of a low-metal contaminated sewage sludge on a barren and contaminated soil to immobilize harmful trace metals and obtain sustainable plant cover. The present study was aimed to create plant cover on a barren soil by a single application of sewage sludge through the process of phytostabilization. The field experiment was conducted in the contaminated area near a zinc smelter with high metal concentration (cadmium, zinc, lead) and poor soil fertility. A single application of sewage sludge from food industry was made and forest species of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L), Norway spruce (Picea abies L) and oak (Quercus robur L) were used for phytoremediation. It was found that single application of sewage sludge was beneficial for development of plant cover and after a five years a significant increase in the biomass of trees (mainly spruce and pine) was achieved. Moreover, in the amended plots, the growth of various species of grasses, dicotyledonous plants, and spontaneous growth of birch was also observed. On control plots with no sewage sludge application, the planted trees gradually withered away during the same period. Sewage sludge from food industry provided plant nutrients effectively utilized by the plants. Its application also increased the water holding capacity in the test plots due to it contribution to soil organic matter. Compared to the control plots, the content of macroelements and carbon in soil was still higher at the end of the 5 year study. The high content of bioavailable macroelements in sewage sludge, poses a potential threat to their leaching and run-off into groundwater, contributing to the emergence of eutrophication of water bodies. However, the results of the experiments showed that the gradual release of macronutrients from sewage sludge were fully used by plants to stimulate their growth and development. The content of cadmium, zinc and lead in plant biomass was much lower compared to untreated plants. Also for treated plants the heavy metals were mainly accumulated in roots. The data from this field trial provided results supporting the use of high quality sewage sludge amendment for remediation of contaminated and barren soils, and large scale trials should be followed up on various degraded soil types.

Although the capacity of rotations to break pest and disease cycles is generally recognized, other benefits of crop rotations in CA systems are seldom acknowledged and little understood. We monitored different conventional and CA cropping systems over the period from 2005 to 2009 in a multi-seasonal trial in Monze, southern Zambia. Both monocropped maize and different maize rotations including cotton and the green manure cover crop sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) were compared under CA conditions, with the aim of elucidating the effects of crop rotations on soil quality soil moisture relations and maize productivity. Infiltration, a sensitive indicator of soil quality, was significantly lower on conventionally ploughed plots in all cropping seasons compared to CA plots. Higher water infiltration rate led to greater soil moisture content in CA maize treatments seeded alter cotton. Earthworm populations, total carbon and aggregate stability were also significantly higher on CA plots. improvements in soil quality resulted in higher rainfall use efficiency and higher maize grain yield on CA plots especially those in a two- or three-year rotation. lit the 2007/08 and 2008/2009 season, highest yields were obtained from direct-seeded maize after sunnhemp, which yielded 74% and 136% more than maize in the conventionally ploughed control treatment with a continuous maize crop. Even in a two-year rotation (maize-cotton), without a legume green manure cover crop, 47% and 38% higher maize yields were recorded compared to maize in the conventionally ploughed control in the two years, respectively This suggests that there are positive effects from crop rotations even in the absence of disease and pest problems.

It is well established that microaggregates provide much of the capacity of soils to protect SOC. In this study, a loss of the capacity of soils to sequester SOC following agriculture was established by comparing samples of an Alfisol, in (1) its virgin condition, (2) following relatively light treatments for agriculture, (3) following conventional cultivation for similar to 120 years, and (4) after 18 years under zero tillage following similar to 100 years under conventional cultivation. It appears that material has been lost from clay and silt fractions relative to sand-size material. Microaggregates in all of the cultivated soils studied were less stable to the `chemical hammer' of osmotic pressure than those in the virgin soil. The introduction of no-till methods did not restore the stability of microaggregates over a period of 18 years following similar to 100 years of conventional cultivation. Pore size distributions from mercury intrusion showed that cultivation always led to a decrease of pore volume in the range of pores between 0.03 and 100 mu m. Transmission electron microscopy showed that a large proportion of microaggregates, previously composed of clay and silt-sized particles, had disintegrated as a result of conventional soil management over the long-term. Surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy and photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy both showed that intimate associations between fine and coarse material have been broken down by intensive soil management practices. The effects on particle size distributions by chemical disruption with either or both hydrogen peroxide and acid ammonium oxalate, and also with alkaline sodium hexametaphosphate, suggested that microaggregates are stabilised by a combination of organic matter, poorly ordered minerals and clay self-associations, regardless of the agricultural history of the soils. Microaggregates appear to be broken down by agriculture through the loss of any of these aggregating agents. The capacity of soils to form microaggregates will also be affected by loss of soil. It appears that both soil, as a whole, and also clay- and silt-size material, selectively, has been lost through wind erosion following prolonged cultivation. Agriculture has led to a decrease in the capacity of the Alfisol to resequester SOC that is effectively irreversible by farming practices. Even so, the resilience of the soil appeared to be improved by changes in farming practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Churchman, G. J.; D'Acqui, L. P.; Foster, R. C.; Janik, L.

We studied the impact of continuous application of rice straw and farmyard manure (FYM) either alone or in conjunction with inorganic fertilizers on aggregate stability and distribution of C and nitrogen (N) in different aggregate fractions after 7 years of rice-wheat cropping on a sandy loam soil. Macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) constituted 32.5-54.5% of total water stable aggregates (WSA) and were linearly related (R(2) = 0.69) to soil organic carbon content. The addition of rice straw and FYM significantly (P < 0.05) improved the formation of macroaggregates with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of microaggregates at all the three sampling depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm). Macroaggregates had higher C and N density as compared to microaggregates. Application of rice straw and FYM improved C and N density in different aggregate sizes and the improvement was greatest in plots that received both rice straw and FYM each year. Application of FYM along with inorganic fertilizer resulted in a net C sequestration of 0.44 t ha(-1) in the plough layer after 7 years of rice-wheat cropping. Carbon sequestration was greater (1.53 t ha(-1)) when both rice straw and FYM along with inorganic fertilizers were applied annually.

While some farmers have simplified the production system through soybean monoculture others have intensified the land-use by increasing the number and diversity in the crop sequence. The effects of this intensification, in terms of soil structural quality, are contradictory, possibly caused by the increase of machinery traffic. In order to assess soil structural quality and the performance of selected morpho-structural variables with different levels of intensification, we analyzed plots under NT with high and low crop sequence intensification (Good -GAP- and Poor -PAP-, agricultural practices respectively) and reference plots in four soils (two Argiudolls, an Haplustoll and an Hapludert) of the Argentinian Pampean region. The morpho-structural variables assessed were Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure at field scale (VESS), visible porosity (Vp), roundness (Rd), eccentricity (Ecc) and 3-D aggregate features (faces, corners and edges). Plots with higher frequency of cereals in the sequence (GAP) presented on average higher VESS scores, higher Vp values and less rounded aggregates with more faces and corners, suggesting that crop sequence intensification induces favorable structural features. VESS, Vp, number of faces and corners were strongly correlated with aggregate stability tests mainly with the fast and fast(10s) test (r: -0.56, -0.74; 0.48, 0.52; 0.46, 0.49 and 0.42, 0.50, respectively) and with the more labile organic carbon fractions -POCc, and POCf-(r: -0.49, -0.5; 0.5, ns; 0.38, 0.48 and 0.31, 0.43, respectively). These observations suggest that the variables examined, concerning aggregates and pores were sensitive to changes in crop sequence and are useful soil quality indicators. However, the occurrence of platy structures also under GAP shows the need to adjust the VESS method to the NT system. Besides, the effect of agricultural intensification on soil morphology was modulated by soil type. In consequence, this last factor has also to be considered for the definition of a quality indicator to track the effect of crop sequences intensification under no-till management.

Native prairies in Kansas are relevant in this context, as some have been annually harvested for hay for over 75 years with no fertilization or detectable decline in yield or soil fertility. In contrast, annual crop production has resulted in significant reductions in soil fertility and now requires intensive inputs to maintain yields. Soil food webs were compared between hayed native grasslands and adjacent annual croplands in order to determine the long-term effects of these two production systems on soil ecosystem properties. Soil chemical and physical properties, bacterial and nematode community structure and abundance were measured across five paired sites at six depth intervals to 1 m. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and water stable aggregates were all significantly greater in perennial grasslands than in annual croplands to a depth of 60 cm. Microbial biomass carbon was also greater in grasslands than in croplands, and shifts in delta(13)C indicated greater input of new carbon at lower depths in grasslands relative to annual croplands. Bacterial and nitrogen fixing communities in croplands and grasslands were significantly different in the surface 40 cm and nematode community differences persisted through 1 m. Nematode community indices suggested enhanced fungal decomposition pathways, fewer plant-feeding nematodes, and greater food web complexity and stability in grassland soils than in annual cropland soils. These data indicate that perennial grasslands in Kansas, even when annually harvested for decades, support higher levels of soil fertility and structure and more complex biological communities than annual cropping systems.

The present field study was designed as long-term experiment in an experimental farm located in the suburb of Shanghai, China, to study the effects of agricultural management practices on community composition of soil fungi and soil structure. Treatments included burning (crop residues burnt vs. not burnt), tillage (tillage vs. no-tillage) and crop rotation (wheat-corn vs. wheat-soybean). The experiment started in June 2001 and soil samples were collected in March, July and November 2003, i.e. 2 years after establishment. Abundance, diversity and species composition of fungi and soil aggregate composition were analyzed. Hypothesis 1 was that abundance, species richness and diversity of soil fungi would increase in treatments with no-tillage, crop residue retention and wheat-legume rotation compared to tillage, burning and wheat-corn rotation, and Hypothesis 2 that size-distribution of stable aggregates would increase with the diversity of soil fungi. A total of 27 species of fungi of 15 genera were isolated. As the Hypothesis 1, overall soil fungal species richness (6.3 +/- 0.4), diversity (2.2 +/- 0.1) and total species number (26) in no-tillage significantly exceeded the species richness (4.4 +/- 0.3), diversity (1.7 +/- 0.1) and total species number (21) in tillage treatments, respectively. However, the effects of tillage depended on soil depth and were most pronounced deeper in soil (10-15 cm soil depth). The Hypothesis 2 was supported by the results: The content of large macro-aggregates (>2000 mu m) (295 +/- 94 g/kg soil) in no-tillage treatments significantly exceeded that (99 +/- 25 g/kg soil) in tillage treatments in 10-15 cm but not in 0-5 cm soil depth, and coincidentally, soil fungal species richness (6.3 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3 +/- 0.1) in 10-15 and also the species richness (6.5 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3 +/- 0.1) in 5-10 cm in no-tillage treatments significantly exceeded the species richness (4.2 +/- 0.7) and diversity (1.6 +/- 0.3) in 10-15 cm and the species richness (4.3 +/- 0.4) and diversity (1.7 +/- 0.2) in 5-10 cm in tillage treatments, respectively, but the differences were also not in 0-5 cm soil depth. The results suggest that no-tillage favours fungi and that a more diverse fungal community beneficially affects the formation of large soil macro-aggregates. Further, the results indicate that species richness and diversity of cultivable fungi are useful and distinctive parameters reflecting the status and functioning of the soil fungal community.

The objective of this study was to assess soil degradation in a non-buffered riparian zone with an annual row crop (ARC) and in a longer established (more than 85 years) riparian cool season grass (CSG) buffer in central Iowa, USA. To achieve our objective, we compared the functioning of the target system, ARC, with a system that has been undisturbed since 1990, CSG. We measured the aggregate size distribution and stability of macroaggregrates, aggregate-associated soil organic carbon and particulate organic matter (POM). The categorization of aggregates by size and water stability (slaking resistance) showed a significantly larger (P<0.05) proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (> 250 mu m) under CSG (53%) than under ARC (26.3%). On the other hand, soil under ARC had the larger proportion of large and small water-unstablemacroaggregates. The results indicate that the concentration of organic C associated with the total water-stable aggregates is 1.9 times greater under CSG (23.9 mgC g(-1)) than for the ARC (12.4 mgC g(-1)). The concentration of carbon in light particulate organic matter (LPOM-C) under CSG accounted for 12% of total soil organic carbon (TSOC), but only 6% under ARC management. The chemical composition of LPOM in the ARC soil had a large alkyl-C/O-alkyl C ratio, which suggests more organic matter decomposition than with the CSG. Electronic micrographs showed evidence that under CSG roots and fungal hyphae form an extensive network around the large macroaggregates (> 2000 mu m), and thus maintain the stability of the macroaggregates. Preserving the CSG buffer reduces soil erosion and the processes associated with nonpoint source pollutants, which improves water quality in an intensively managed agricultural system.","Garcia, V.

The coefficient of variation indicated low variability for soil particles density, bulk density, total and average porosity for the variables of macro-and microporosiy, and organic carbon. The variables analyzed showed spatial dependence, which was observed in kriging maps.

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of amended soils after incubation was performed. Experimental results show that amendment increased biological soil activity, soil porosity and stability of aggregates. DTA analysis shows that the first exothermic peak generally increases with the dosage of DPS:SL due to the addition of immature organic matter.

We assessed the capacity of an alley cropping system to sustain corn productivity. The experiment included six treatments: Clitoria + Pigeon Pea; Leucaena + Pigeon Pea; Acacia + Pigeon Pea; Clitoria + Leucaena; Leucaena + Acacia and Control treatment (no legumes). We determined chemical and physical indicators of soil quality. Leucaena had the highest macronutrient concentrations (40.17 g N kg(-1)), except for P. All legumes had high Ca (13.82-17.84 g kg(-1)) and very low P (0.51-2.83 g kg(-1)) and Mg (1.73-2.92 g kg(-1)) concentrations. Acacia had the lowest N, P, K and Mg concentrations. Pre-planting soil analysis indicated that soil quality indicators were below the critical levels needed for a productive agricultural system, especially for phosphorus, sum of bases and base saturation. Physical indicators of quality, such as bulk density (1.40-1.30 Mg m(-3)), total porosity (0.46-0.50 m m(-3)) and soil aeration capacity (0.10-0.17 m m(-3)), were substantially improved as a result of the surface application of residues. There was a cumulative effect of residue application on corn crop productivity. Because of its capacity to recycle nutrients and improve soil quality over the period of 3 years, alley cropping in association with no-tillage, can be an efficient strategy for maintaining productivity in the low-fertility soils of the humid tropics.","Bicudo, Silvio Jose; Coelho, Katia Pereira; Ferreira Aguiar, Alana das Chagas; Salgado Costa Sobrinho, Joao Reis; Silva Martins, Alba Leonor; de Moura, Emanoel Gomes",,86,2010,,,

Quantitative information is needed to support policy actions for food and water security and development. The objective of this study was to assess and characterize CO2-C emissions in degraded (DP) and managed pasture (MP) areas located close to one another, describing their spatial-temporal variability and any correlation with possible controlling factors. A grid of 100x100m with 102 sample points in each area was set up. Measurements of CO2-C emission (FCO2), soil temperature (T-soil), soil water content (WCsoil), soil physical (i.e. soil texture, soil bulk density, macro-porosity, micro-porosity, air-filled pore space and total pore volume) and chemical (i.e. pH, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and cation exchange capacity) analysis were conducted at each sample point. Total emissions calculated from the area below the FCO2 graphs were 640.7 and 440.0kg CO2-Cha(-1) in the DP and MP, respectively. Soil temperature in the MP was lower (t-test, p<0.01) throughout the experimental period when compared with the DP. This study found that the degraded pasture area released significantly more CO2-C compared with the well-managed pasture. Therefore, the introduction of best management practices in pasture areas is an important strategy to reduce soil CO2-C losses and promote soil C accumulation. The MP presented lower FCO2 despite its higher soil C stock, indicating a more stable soil C condition when compared with the DP area.

The dye infiltration depth in the control was small and homogeneous compared to the plots with OMW application, which fostered the generation of heterogeneous flux fields including preferential flow conditions As a consequence, fields irrigated with OMW are more prone to groundwater contamination with substances either originating from the OMW itself or from agricultural chemicals.

Soil samples were collected from strawberry crops used during 4 years as mono cropping system, covered by either straw or black polyethylene (plastic mulching). Soil physicochemical properties included water content, pH, effective cation exchange capacity, elemental analysis of total carbon and nitrogen, dissolved and total organic carbon, and soil stability by percentage of water-stable aggregates (>0.2 mm). Soil microbial analysis comprised soil microbial biomass (C-mic and N-mic and DNA concentrations) and estimation of soil eco-physiological conditions C-mic:C-org and N-mic:N-tot. Soil bacteria and a fraction of cultivable fungi were studied respectively by molecular analysis and counting of colony forming units (CFU values). Mycotoxin concentration in soil (deoxynivalenol) was used as an indirect indicator of fungal stress. The plastic mulching system showed positive effects on soil physicochemical properties as compared to straw mulching: Higher soil carbon content and better aggregate stability were observed in soils under plastic film, and the values for soil microbial biomass were comparable in both systems. Yet, soil eco-physiological conditions under plastic mulching were less appropriate compared to straw, as reflected by a reduced C-mic:C-org ratio (1.3 +/- 0.3%), followed by a decline of the number of bacteria (18%), a six-fold reduction of the biomass of soil cultivable fungi, and finally by a two-times higher deoxynivalenol concentration in soil (mean 2.2 +/- 2.4 mu g kg(-1)). This indicates that the plastic mulching system led to less favourable soil conditions and that the production of mycotoxins can be understood as a stress induced response by fungi. Further information is therefore needed to assess how the quality of soil is restricted by the shift of soil microbial communities and by the production of mycotoxins, especially in intensive agriculture with long-term plastic coverage.

We assessed the short-term impact of shallow tillage [field cultivator (FC), rotary tiller (RT) and spading machine (SM)] on some soil quality indicators [bulk density, water-stable aggregates, total and labile organic C pools (microbial biomass and extractable organic C), soil respiration and related eco-physiological indexes] in a Sicilian vineyard. Also no tillage was included. We hypothesized that (i) RT and FC worsened soil quality indicators more than SM, and (ii) within the same tillage system, labile C pools, soil respiration and eco-physiological indexes will respond more efficiently than chemical and physical soil properties since the tillage starts. The experiment started at March 2009, and each tillage type was applied three times per year (March or April, May and June), with soil tilled up to 15-cm depth. Soil was sampled (0-15 and 15-30-cm depth) in March 2009, April 2010, May 2012 and June 2014. SM was very effective in preserving soil organic matter pool and in improving any monitored soil quality indicator, similarly to no tillage. By contrast, RT was the most deleterious machine as it worsened most investigated indicators. Such deleterious effects were due to drastic disruption of soil aggregates and consequent exposition of protected soil organic matter to further microbial mineralization. Labile organic C pools and microbial quotients were the most responsive soil parameters for assessing the impact of shallow tillage on soil quality, even in the short term (<5 years).

Ultisols and soils under forest had increased soil C as a result of increased C concentrations in aggregates. Nearly 90% of the soil C was found in macroaggregates of soils under forest and in Ultisols. In forest and agriculture land use, soil silt+clay content was an important determinant for C storage in the bulk soil but not in aggregates. Cultivation reduced the percentage of soil mass in large macroaggregates (> 2,000 mu m) relative to that in forest soils, whereas Ultisols had greater soil mass percentage in large macroaggregates than Inceptisols. Overall, macroaggregates have higher labile and stable C than microaggregates. Ultisols had greater amounts of labile C but similar proportions of stable C. As has been found in other soils dominated by mixed-mineralogy and 1:1 clays and oxides, aggregate-associated C is not the sole determinant for the formation of macroaggregates.","Espinoza, Yusmary; Sotomayor-Ramirez, David",,94,2010,,,

Four treatments were used: (i) no plastic-film mulch and no straw incorporation, (ii) plastic-film mulch only, (iii) straw incorporation only, and (iv) straw incorporation plus mulch. Seven years after continuous treatment application, the use of plastic-film mulch increased the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) in the top 15-cm soil layer by 16-28%, across sampling times and sites. Straw incorporation similarly increased the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates. However, the effects of mulch, on increasing the mean weight diameter of aggregates were greater in non-straw-incorporated soils than in straw-incorporated soils, and vice versa. Soil bulk density in the top 15-cm soil layer marginally increased in the mulched treatments, relative to the non-mulched treatments, while it decreased in straw-incorporated treatments. In addition, there was a decrease in soil pH, by 0.19-0.54 units, in the mulched, relative to the non-mulched soils. Combining our previous results, we suggested that increases in maize root growth and microbial activity were linked to the increased soil aggregation while accumulation in soil nitrate resulting from the stimulated soil nitrogen mineralization was responsible for the marginally decreased soil pH in the plastic-film mulched relative to the non mulched soils, due to increased soil hydrothermal conditions.

In this study, a topo- and chrono-sequence approach was used to investigate relationships between SOC and soil aggregate formation. Our hypothesis was that the greatest increases in SOC sequestration rates are associated with most recently established prairies oil cultivated land, where SOC was the most depleted, due to the destruction of soil aggregate. The study was conducted in Jasper and Warren counties in Iowa, from 2005 to 2008. Soils in both Counties were formed in loess under native vegetation of tallgrass prairie. There were three reconstructed prairie sites varying in establishment year-1993, 1998, 2003; a row crop production site tinder no-tillage; and a prairie remnant site. All soil and plant sampling plots were located on summit, midslope, and toe-slope positions. Results show that time since establishment and slope position had a significant impact on SOC sequestration rates in the top 15 cm (6 in) soil depth only. In the summit position, the greatest SOC sequestration rates were observed in the youngest prairie at 2.15 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.96 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)), and decreased to near equilibrium after approximately eight years. Additionally, SOC was shown to increase linearly at a rate of 0.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.33 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)) since prairie establishment during the 14-year period. In the toe-slope position, SOC sequestration rates were substantially lower at 0.59 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.26 m ac(-1) yr(-1)). Furthermore, increases in SOC sequestration rates coincided with increases in water stable aggregate-associated carbon (C) in 0.25 to 2 mm (0.01 to 0.08 in) size fractions. This occurred in the youngest reconstructed prairie (2003) in the summit and in the midslope positions on prairies reconstructed in 1998 and 1993. This suggests that the mechanisms of soil aggregate formation aid in stabilizing SOC, which is significantly affected by slope position and years since prairie establishment.","Al-Kaisi, Mahdi; Guzman, Jose G.",,65,2010,,,

Randomized complete block design (RCBD) was finalized for the experiment with three repeats. Maximum total biomass production and grain yield were recorded in case of deep tillage practices. Conventional tillage not only improved leaf area index but also harvest. Minimum tillage minimized the leaching of nutrients especially nitrates.

System,"A field experiment with rice at the Research Farm, Department of Agronomy, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India under a rice-wheat system was conducted to study the long-term effect of integrated nutrient management (INM) on physico-chemical and microbiological properties of soil after 23 cycles of a rice-wheat cropping system. The experiment comprised 14 treatment combinations viz., N, P and K fertilizer application as individual component and use of chemical fertilizers in conjunction with different organic sources to substitute 25% to 50% N through farm yard manure (FYM), wheat cut straw (WCS), and green manure (GM) with Sesbania aculeata. The experimental treatments were replicated three times. GM, WCS, and FYM improved the physical properties of soil like water-holding capacity, penetration resistance, and bulk density. The integrated nutrient management technique resulted in a positive influx of nutrients by increasing organic carbon content, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium varying from 0.390 to 0.543%, 171.7 to 219.3 kg ha-1, 20.5 to 43.3 kg ha-1, and 124.6 to 148.9 kg ha-1, respectively. Also, NO3-N and NH4-N and DTPA-extractable Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn content showed significant improvement in the soil with the addition of FYM, WCS, and GM. These three organic sources of nutrition along with chemical fertilizers helped to improve infiltration rate, available soil moisture, labile C, and microbial count. However, there was a decrease in bulk density, soil strength, pH, and EC of soil with the application of FYM, WCS, and GM in conjunction with chemical fertilizers as compared with chemical fertilizer application alone.","Dhaliwal, S.

One of the principal causes of soil degradation are deep and intensive tillage operations, especially under moist soil conditions. To minimize erosion and soil compaction, the adoption of conservation tillage or reduced tillage (RT) agriculture is widely recognized. However, crop rotations in Western Europe often include root crops that are generally assumed to be less suitable under RT agriculture because they result in a high disturbance of the soil at the formation of the ridges and at harvest. A detailed understanding of the influence of the different types of tillage on the soil properties aggregate stability, penetration resistance (PR) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) is important for management strategies. The objective of this chapter is comparing the physical properties of silt loam soils under different tillage systems in Belgian fields. The aggregate stability of the 0-10 cm layer was measured in the laboratory. The stability index measured by the `dry and wet sieving' method of De Leenheer and De Boodt (1959) was 40% higher under RT than conventional tillage (CT) agriculture. The mean weight diameter (MWD) measured with the three methods of Le Bissonnais (1996) was significantly higher even after short-term RT compared to CT agriculture. The MWD after a heavy shower, a slow wetting and stirring the soil after prewetting was 19%, 38% and 34% higher for RT than CT fields, respectively. The PR was studied in the field with a hand penetrologger. The PR of fields under RT was higher in the first layers due to less (RT with cultivator or soil loosener [=RTC]) or no disturbance (RT by direct drilling [=RTDD]) of the soil structure. The crop growth of RTC fields seemed not to be affected by this superficial compaction. However, the crop growth of RTDD fields was lower than of CT fields. The PR measurements indicated a plough pan at depth in some field under CT. The measurement of the infiltration rate with a Guelph pressure infiltrometer in the field showed that Kfs tended to be lower under CT than the other types of tillage. We can conclude that RTC is a form of agriculture that is more sustainable than CT agriculture in these silt loam soils. This research indicated that short term RTDD agriculture under crop rotations with root crops often result in a lower crop yield, which is probably correlated with the higher PR in the 10-30 cm depth layer. Therefore, the potential of RTDD agriculture in Western Europe is probably limited.","Casamitjana Causa, Maria; D'Haene, Karoline; De Neve, Stefaan; Gabriels, Donald; Loaiza Usuga, Juan Carlos",,,2010,,,

The sustainability of organic agriculture, however, is less well understood, especially under long-term management. A study was conducted near Mead, NE, to investigate the long-term impacts of organic management on soil physical properties including soil aggregate stability, bulk density, Proctor bulk density (parameter of soil's susceptibility to compaction), water infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil-water retention characteristics in conventional farming (CR1), conventional farming with diversified rotation (DIR), organic practices with green manure (OGM), and organic practices with animal manure (OAM). The OGM and OAM treatments increased cumulative water infiltration by about 10 times compared with the CR1 treatment, indicating that organic farming can increase water storage relative to conventional systems. Mean weight diameter of water-stable soil aggregates increased by 50% with the OGM and by 30% with the OAM treatments in the upper 15-cm depth, indicating that aggregates were larger and more stable under organic than conventional practices. At the same depth, the Proctor bulk density was 3% lower under organic practices than in the CR1 treatment, suggesting that organic farming reduces the soil's susceptibility to compaction. The increase in aggregate stability and porosity increased water infi ltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Overall, organic farming can improve soil physical properties in the long term and provide a strategy for farmers to enhance soil physical quality and agricultural sustainability.","Blanco-Canqui, Humberto; Francis, Charles A.; Galusha, Tomie D.; Williams, Dallas M.",,109,2017,,,

This study aims to quantify how the chemical and physical properties of peat change during land conversion to oil palm. This will be addressed by comparing four separate stages of conversion; namely, secondary peat swamp forests, recently deeply drained secondary forests, cleared and recently planted oil palm, and mature oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia. Results indicate accelerated peat decomposition in surface peats of mature oil palm plantations due to the lowered water table and altered litter inputs associated with this land-use change. Surface organic matter content and peat C stocks at secondary forest sites were higher than at mature oil palm sites (e.g. C stocks were 975 +/- 151 and 497 +/- 157 Mg ha(-1) at secondary forest and mature oil palm sites, respectively). Land conversion altered peat physical properties such as shear strength, bulk density and porosity, with mirrored changes above and below the water table. Our findings suggest close links between the organic matter and C content and peat physical properties through the entire depth of the peat profile. We have demonstrated that conversion from secondary peat swamp forest to mature oil palm plantation may seriously compromise C storage and, through its impact on peat physical properties, the water holding capacity in these peatlands.

Images with a pixel size of 6.9 mu m were then processed with Image) software for pore network analysis. The treatments were no tillage (C-NT) and conventional tillage (C-CT) in China, and shallow tillage (G-ST) and conventional tillage (G-CT) in Belgium. The results showed that aggregates in conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT) had numerous connected pores compared with conventional tillage (G-CT and C-CT). The Euler number (Ev) was significantly lower and visible total porosity and surface area (SA) were significantly higher in conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT) than in conventional tillage (G-CT and C-CT) in both studied locations. The predominant size of pores was significantly higher in conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT) than in conventional tillage (G-CT and C-CT) (>150 mu m vs 90-120 mu m). Pore location within the aggregates also showed differences, with porosity being evenly distributed in the aggregates under conventional tillage ('G-CT and C-CT). Under conservational tillage (G-ST and C-NT), the aggregates were heterogeneous, showing higher porosity at the center of the aggregates. There was a higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the external layer than in the internal layer in conservational tillage in Belgium (G-ST). In no tillage in China (C-NT), the SOC in the external and internal layers, however, showed similar results. Overall, conventional tillage (G-CT andC-CT) reduced the proportion of the largest pores within soil aggregates, whereas there was no significant relationship between pore morphologies and SOC content.

Intensive plough tillage (PT), use of agricultural chemicals and the burning of crop residues are major farm activities emitting GHGs. Intensive PT also degrades soil properties by reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. In this scenario, adoption of no-till (NT) systems offers a pragmatic option to improve soil properties and reduce GHG emission. We evaluated the impacts of tillage systems (NT and PT) and wheat residue mulch on soil properties and GHG emission. This experiment was started in 1989 on a Crosby silt loam soil at Waterman Farm, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. Mulching reduced soil bulk density and improved total soil porosity. More total carbon (16.16 g kg(-1)), SOC (8.36 mg L-1) and soil microbial biomass carbon (152 mu g g(-1)) were recorded in soil under NT than PT. Mulch application also decreased soil temperature (0-5cm) and penetration resistance (0-60cm). Adoption of long-term NT reduced the GHG emission. Average fluxes of GHGs under NT were 1.84g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for carbon dioxide, 0.07mg CH4-C m(-2) day(-1) for methane and 0.73mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1) for nitrous oxide compared with 2.05g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1), 0.74mg CH4-Cm(-2)day(-1) and 1.41mg N2O-N m(-2) day(-1), respectively, for PT.

Rainfed agriculture on these soils is also hindered by the scarcity of water. No-tillage can increase plant-available water and soil organic matter, thus helping overcome most factors limiting crop production in this area. Our objective was to determine how conventional- and no-tillage practices affected soil physical quality indicators and water availability in an on-farm study in the Ebro Valley. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 5-, 5 to 15-, and 15 to 30-cm depth increments within adjacent farmer-managed conventional- and no-tillage fields in 2007 and 2008. Both fields were managed for continuous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) production. The soil at both sites is a silt loam (Haplic Calcisol). Aggregate-size distribution and stability, soil water retention characteristics, organic carbon, and total carbonates were determined in 2007. Pore-size distribution was estimated from the water retention curve. Penetration resistance, soil bulk density and field water content during the entire crop growing season were measured for both fields in 2008. Aggregate dry mean weight diameter and stability in water were 1.2 and 2.2 times greater, respectively, under no-tillage than conventional tillage due to reduced mechanical disturbance and increased soil organic carbon content. Bulk density was 1.12 times greater (P < 0.1) under no-tillage only in the 0-5-cm depth. Two times greater penetration resistance to a depth of 15 cm in this treatment was related to bulk density and aggregates stability. Field water content was greater with no-tillage than conventional tillage during the driest months in 2008. The volume of equivalent diameter pores (0.2-9 mu m) was 1.5 times higher under no-tillage. This increased plant-available water content and doubled barley production under no-tillage in 2008, which was a very dry year. We conclude that despite the greater penetration resistance under no-tillage, increased water availability as a result of improved structure characteristics was more important for crop yield. This suggests that producers should seriously consider adopting no-tillage practices for soil conservation in semiarid degraded areas like the one studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed the impact of different tillage systems on soil aggregates by measuring the aggregate stability, the organic carbon (C(org)) and the total nitrogen (N(tot)) contents within different aggregate fractions, and their release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Soil samples were collected from the top 0 to 10 cm of a long-term tillage experiment at Fuchsenbigl (Marchfeld, Austria) where conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and minimum tillage (MT) treatments were applied to a Chernozem fine sandy loam. The stable aggregates (1000-2000 mu m) were subject to dispersion by the soil aggregate stability (SAS or wet sieving) method after Kemper and Rosenau (1986), and the ultrasonic method of Mayer et al. (2002). Chemical analysis of the soil was obtained for the aggregate fractions 630-1000, 250-630 and 63-250 mu m gathered from the ultrasonic method. Using the SAS method, CT and RT had the least amounts of stable aggregates (18.2% and 18.9%, respectively), whereas MT had twice as much stable aggregates (37.6%). Using the ultrasonic method, MT also had the highest amount of water stable aggregates in all three fractions (1.5%, 3.7%, and 35%, respectively), followed by RT (1%, 2.3%, 32.3%), and CT (0.8%, 1.7%, 29.1%). For comparison, a reference soil, EUROSOIL 7 (ES-7) was also analysed (40%, 6.7%, and 12.1%). The highest amounts of C(org) and N(tot) were measured under MT in all three fractions, with 8.9%, 3.8%, and 1.3% for C(org), and 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.1% for N(tot). Apart from the fraction 630-1000 mu m, the aggregates of RT and CT contained <50% of the C(org) and N(tot) values of MT. The C/N ratio was least favourable for CT (42.6) in the aggregate fraction 630-1000 mu m. The DOC release from stable aggregates after 10 min of ultrasonic dispersion was highest from MT soil (86.7 mg l(-1)). The values for RT and CT were 21% and 25% below this value. The results demonstrate that tillage type influences both aggregate stability and aggregate chemical composition. This research confirms that CT interferes more with the natural soil properties than RT and MT. Furthermore, MT has the highest potential to sequester C and N in this agriculturally used soil.

Either rotation of crops with pastures (ROT) or no-till (NT) cropping have been proposed as alternatives to minimize the impact of agriculture on soil quality. The combined impact on soil properties of ROT and NT has not been evaluated. In this study, we report results of the first 12 years of a long-term experiment established on a clay loam soil in western Uruguay. The objective was to determine the influence of conventional tillage (CT) and NT on systems under continuous cropping (CC, two crops per year) or ROT (3.5-year annual crops/2.5-year pastures). Soil samples taken at the beginning of the experiment in 1994 and in 2004 were analyzed for organic carbon (SOC), total organic carbon (TSOC) and total nitrogen content (STN), and for water-stable aggregation (WAS). Soil loss and erodibility indicators were studied using microrain simulator. With 12 years, the cumulative carbon (C) inputs of aboveground biomass were similar between tillage, but C input in CC was 50% higher than ROT. This difference was explained because 84% of the pastures dry matter was consumed by animals. Nevertheless we estimated a higher below ground biomass in ROT compared to CC systems (24.9 Mg ha(-1) vs. 10.9 Mg ha(-1)). NT presented 7% higher SOC than CT (0-18 cm) with no differences between rotation systems. While all treatments declined in STN during 12 years, ROT had 11% and 58% higher STN and WAS than CC systems, with a large impact of the pasture under CT. Runoff and erosion were minimized under NT in both rotations systems. Thus, including pastures in the rotation, or switching from CT to NT improved soil quality properties. The expected benefit of combining NT and ROT will likely require more years for the cumulative effect to be detectable in both C input and soil properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in aggregation were studied in relation to the addition of maize residues and application of wetting and drying cycles under controlled laboratory weathering conditions during 105 days of incubation. Large water stable macroaggregate (>2.00 mm) formation was controlled by the addition of organic residues and application of one wetting and drying event after organic amendment increased large water stable macroaggregate formation by 26% compared to constantly wet soil. Despite the reduction on the amount of large water stable macroaggregates (>2.00 mm) with repeated wetting and drying events the amended treatment under wetting and drying showed 136% and 70% more large water stable macroaggregates than the constantly wet soil after 58 and 105 days of incubation, respectively, indicating a higher degree of stability. Conversely to large macroaggregates (>2.00 mm), formation of small water stable macroaggregates (0.25-2.00 mm) was not enhanced by the organic addition, but was affected by wetting and drying and time. Unamended soil under wetting and drying showed an increase of 20% in the amount of small water stable macroaggregates (0.25-2.00 mm) compared to amended samples after one wetting and drying cycle. In addition, the control treatment showed a similar increase after 58 days of incubation. which could probably indicate the influence of other mechanisms such as “ageing” in the formation of small macroaggregates. Results of this study indicated a more complex interrelation among factors involved in the formation of macroaggregates in Vertisols compared to rigid soils. These results provided much needed information on the differences in the relative influence of organic residues addition and wetting and drying on the formation and stabilization of macroaggregates in smectitic Vertisols.

The percentage of water-stable macroaggregates (> 2, 2-0.25 mm) and aggregate stability (mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates, WMWD) were significantly higher in alfalfa soils than in crop soils. There was a significant linear relationship between total SOC concentration and aggregate parameters (mean weight diameter) for alfalfa soils, indicating that aggregate stability was closely associated with increased SOC concentration following the conversion of crops to alfalfa. The SOC and N concentrations and the C/N ratio were greatest in the > 2 mm water-stable aggregates and the smallest in the 0.25-0.05 mm aggregates in crop and alfalfa soils.

We focus this literature review on farm management strategies that tighten nutrient cycles and maintain yields. We examined six metrics for efficient nutrient cycling in agroecosystems: reduced runoff and erosion, reduced leaching, improved soil carbon storage, enhanced microbial biomass, low greenhouse gas emissions, improved water holding capacity, and high yields. We evaluated these metrics in six farm management practices: intercrops, agroforestry, cover crops, organic amendments, integrated crop-livestock, and conservation tillage. Agroforestry and cover crops consistently reduced runoff and erosion and improved carbon sequestration compared to conventional systems. Agroforestry was the only practice that consistently reduced nutrient leaching over conventional practices. Organic amendments and conservation tillage improve water holding capacity. There exists uncertainty in the effectiveness of these practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Finally, although agroforestry tends to suppress yields, all of the practices had either a neutral or positive effect on yields. Evaluating cropping systems in terms of multiple services gives us insight into how to match practices to environmental goals, where the uncertainties lie, and where opportunities exist for improved agroecosystem management.","Ryals, Rebecca; Tully, Kate",,41,2017,,,

FYM treatment performed better for the measured traits. Water holding capacities around wilting point and around field capacity were apparently improved and a net increase in plant available water holding capacity was obtained by organic matter treatments.

A 10-year field experiment was conducted in Inner Mongolia to compare the long-term effects of no-tillage with straw cover (NT), subsoiling with straw cover (ST), rototilling with straw cover (RT) and traditional tillage (TT) using ploughs on soil properties and productivity in a spring wheat-oat cropping system. Long-term conservation tillage increased soil organic matter in the top 20 cm by 21.4%, total N by 31.8% and Olsen's P by 34.5% in the 0-5 cm layer compared to traditional tillage. Mean percentage of macro-aggregates (> 0.25 mm, +20%) and macroporosity (> 60 mu m, +52.1%) also improved significantly in the 0-30 cm soil layer (P < 0.05). The largest yield improvements coupled with greatest water use efficiency (WUE) were achieved by no-tillage with straw cover. Ten-year mean crop yields increased by 14.0% and WUE improved by 13.5% compared to traditional tillage due to greater soil moisture and improved soil physical and chemical status. These improvements in soil properties and productivity are of considerable importance for the seriously degraded soils in semiarid Inner Mongolia, as well as for food security, sustainable agriculture and carbon storage in the farming-pasture transition regions of China.","He, J.; Kuhn, N.

In contrast, agriculture is the second largest C emitter, after burning of fossil fuels. This organic carbon (OC) introduced into the soil, mainly via organic matter (OM), is essential for several soil properties and plays an extremely important role in sandy soils. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in the amounts and pools of OC and the influence thereof on some physical soil properties in areas converted from pasture to eucalyptus. The following areas were analyzed: a degraded pasture (PAST), two areas of pasture-eucalyptus conversion after 2 and 15 years (EU02 and EU15, respectively) and a preserved Cerrado area (CER) in the east of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Soil samples were taken from the 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.30 m layers. The OC was measured and analyzed, the carbon pool (CP) calculated, aggregate stability, bulk density (BD), and macro-and microporosity determined, and total porosity (TP) calculated to analyze the influence of land use on soil properties. The experimental design was completely randomized, and four clusters per area were established, with nine subsampling points, for a total of 36 subsamples per area, organized in 20 x 20 m grids, The soil under natural vegetation (preserved Cerrado) was used as a control. The change from CER to commercial cultivation accelerates the process of OC loss (reductions of 25-35 %) and reductions in soil physical quality. In the PAST area, OC was reduced by 30 % in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. Cumulative OC and CP were highest in the 0.00-0.05 m layer and decreased in the deeper layers in all land use treatments. Organic C in the 0.10-0.30 m layer was not influenced by land use, indicating the possibility of OC persistence in the soil for longer periods. Macroporosity and total porosity may be considered appropriate in CER and EU15, whereas the conditions for plant development in PAST and EU02 were restrictive. Land use systems reduced OC and the CP, indicating anthropogenic disturbance of the soil compared to CER. Fifteen years after planting eucalyptus in the pasture area, signs of recovery of some soil physical properties were observed, e.g., reduced BD and increased TP.","Faria, Glaucia Amorim; Maltoni, Katia Luciene; Rodrigues Cassiolato, Ana Maria; Sena, Karla Nascimento",,41,2017,,,

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that permanent vegetative buffers increase WSA and contribute to increased soil enzyme activity. Soil samples (5 cm diameter and 10 cm long) from agroforestry (AG), grass buffer (GIB), grass waterway (GWW) and crop (CS) areas were collected from summit, middle, and lower landscape positions at the Paired Watershed Study, near Novelty, MO. Water-stable aggregates (>250 mu m diameter; wet-sieving method), soil carbon, and soil enzyme activity were determined and data were statistically analyzed. Soils under permanent vegetative buffers and GWW had significantly lower bulk density and more WSA than the crop areas. Soil carbon contents were highest in the GWW and lowest in the CS treatments. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, beta-glucosidase, and glucosaminadase enzyme activities were higher in AG, GB, and GWW soils than CS soils. Dehydrogenase activity differed between grass buffer or GWW and crop areas. The results of the study show that WSA, soil carbon, and functional diversity of enzyme activity increased due to establishment of buffers with trees and grass. It can be speculated that increased diversity of functional enzymes associated with cycling of key soil nutrients and improved soil physical properties may reduce nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) from row-crop agriculture watersheds thus improving overall environmental quality.

This study evaluated the degree of sustainability of commercial sugarcane production in Northern Belize by determining soil parameters (physical and chemical) in three soil layers (0-15, 15-30 and 30-50cm) and crop profitability relative to years of sugarcane cultivation (4-25years since land conversion). The parameters evaluated were organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity (CEC), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, dry bulk density (DBD), porosity (integral), and water-filled pore space (WFPS). Field interviews were conducted to document management practices, agricultural inputs, production costs, and yield. The results showed that OM and TN in all soil layers studied and CEC in the 30-50cm layer decreased, and were negatively correlated, with years of sugarcane cultivation. This indicates that prolonged sugarcane cropping has detrimental effects on soil fertility. There was no clear pattern with years under sugarcane cultivation for P, pH, DBD, and K. Yield levels were maintained by intensification of cultivation, e.g. high inputs and regular replanting, providing short-term benefits at the expense of deterioration of soil fertility.

Changes in water stable aggregates (WSA), mean weight diameter (MWD), aggregate-associated C and N, total soil C and N, relative to control and inorganically fertilized soil were measured. Total WSA were significantly (p = 0.05) higher for soils when rice straw compost either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers was applied as compared to control. The application of rice straw compost either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers increased the macroaggregate size fractions except for 0.25-0.50 mm fraction. The MWD was significantly (p = 0.05) higher in plots receiving rice straw compost either alone at 8 tonnes ha(-1) (0.51 mm at wheat harvest and 0.41 mm at rice harvest) or at 2 tonnes ha(-1) in combination with inorganic fertilizers (0.43 and 0.38 mm) as compared to control (0.34 and 0.33 mm) or inorganically fertilized plots (0.33 and 0.31 mm). The macroaggregates had higher C and N density compared to microaggregates. Application of rice straw compost at 2 tonnes ha(-1) along with inorganic fertilizers (IN + 2RSC) increased C and N concentration significantly over control. The C and N concentration increased further when rice straw compost at 8 tonnes ha(-1) (8RSC) was added. It is concluded that soils can be rehabilitated and can sustain the soil C and N levels with the continuous application of rice straw compost either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers.

However, it increased in all treatments containing manure (M, MN, MP, and MNP) compared to the CK. The changes in dispersion rate and fractal dimension were opposite to those indicators in all treatments. The applications of chemical fertilizers do guarantee an increase in crop yield, but only organic fertilizers significantly improved soil structure.

Thus, i) soils with the same source material have distinct resistance to compression with increased NT adoption time; ii) the most sensitive indicators of this change are the ratios mass: volume and volume: volume and; iii) there is a relationship between resistance and compaction susceptibility with the amount and type of oxide.

Repeated (> 7 years annual additions) and relatively large OC inputs (up to 65 t OC ha(-1)) were needed to produce measurable changes in soil properties, particularly physical properties. However, over all the study sites, there was a positive relationship between OC inputs and changes in total soil OC and `light' fraction OC (LFOC), with LFOC providing a more sensitive indicator of changes in soil organic matter status. Total soil OC increased by an average of 3% for every 10 t ha(-1) manure OC applied, whereas LFOC increased by c. 14%. The measured soil OC increases were equivalent to c. 23% of the manure OC applied (up to 65 t OC ha(-1) applied over 9 years) and c. 22% of the crop residue OC applied (up to 32 t OC ha(-1) over 23 years). The manure OC inputs (but not crop residue OC inputs) increased topsoil porosity and plant available water capacity, and decreased bulk density by 0.6%, 2.5% and 0.5% with every 10 t ha(-1) manure OC applied, respectively. Both OC sources increased the size of the microbial biomass (11% increase in biomass C with 10 t OC ha(-1) input), but only manure OC increased its activity (16% increase in the soil respiration rate with 10 t OC ha(-1) input). Likewise, the potentially mineralizable N pool only increased with manure N inputs (14% increase with 1 t manure total N ha(-1)).

Fresh groundwater and wastewater of Mymensingh municipality were used to irrigate a wheat field for three consecutive years to examine the effects of wastewater application on soil properties. In this study, the properties of wastewater-irrigated soil were compared with freshwater-irrigated soil. The application of wastewater reduced the bulk density of the surface soil by 1.92% and augmented the porosity by 5.89%. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity of the soil were improved under wastewater irrigation. Soil pH increased due to wastewater application but decreased, to a smaller extent, due to fertilizer application. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) increased both with wastewater and with fertilizer application; both parameters changed significantly in the 0-20cm soil layer. However, at the deeper layers, they were not affected by wastewater application.

These land use changes are usually accompanied by decreasing in concentrations of soil organic carbon and nutrients and also deterioration of soil structure in these regions. However, studies on concentration of nutrients and carbohydrates in soils suggest that the location of nutrients within aggregates of each size should be determined. This study was to evaluate the nutrient elements and carbohydrate distributions within water-stable aggregates (WSA) of virgin forest and pasture lands under different land uses in Alborz maintain range, northern Iran. In September 2006, soil samples were collected from depths of 0-20 cm in Typic Haploxerolls soils. The overall pattern indicated that the mean weight diameter (MWD) and WSA were greater in the virgin pasture and forest soils compared with the adjacent cultivated (ex-forest and ex-pasture) soils and aggregates of >1.0 mm size were dominant in the virgin soils, whereas the cultivated soils comprised aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. Distribution of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbohydrates within the WSA showed preferential enrichment of these parameters in the macroaggregate fraction (4.75-1.0 mm) for the virgin soils and microaggregate fraction (>0.25 mm) for the exposed soils. Cultivation decreased the concentration of carbohydrates by 23.6% and 20.6% in ex-forest and ex-pasture lands, respectively. Average distribution of total exchangeable bases within WSA showed that the cultivation of forest and pasture soils significantly led to reduce in these nutrient in the 4.75-2.0 mm fraction and increase in concentration of these exchangeable cations in <0.25 mm fractions. In general, results indicated that cultivation significantly led to 71 % and 6% reductions in total exchangeable bases within the 4.75-2.0 and <0.25 mm aggregate fraction, respectively, for virgin soil. Since smaller aggregates are preferentially removed by erosion, this study emphasizes the need for sustainable soil management practices that they will minimize nutrient loss when forest or pastures lands are converted to croplands.

Deficient drainage is the most important natural characteristic of these soils which therefore are mainly in use for irrigated rice (Oriza sativa). Degradation in these soils is progressively getting stronger since the intensity of agricultural activities leads to a higher soil density, and a lower water infiltration rate. There is a growing interest by farmers to grow other crops such as soybean in rotation with (flood) irrigated rice but this degradation has become an obstacle to do so. This study was done with the objective to assess the soil physical and chemical quality of the three rice management systems (conventional, semi-direct and pre-germinated) most used in the region of Camaqua municipality, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Samples were collected from 21 rice farms with 2 different types of lowland soil (Albaqualf and Humaquepts). The soil samples were analysed for physical and chemical properties. Using multivariate analysis of covariance (Mancova), the effects of the natural variability in terms of soil clay content were separated from the management effects. The analysis revealed that soil physical and chemical properties were affected by the management practices adopted by farmers. The results showed that the major effect of the management systems was on a physical property: bulk density. An increase in soil density in the pre-germinated and conventional systems was found to be caused by a significant reduction in the volume occupied by micropores, an indication of structural degradation. The semi-direct management system, associated with less intensive tillage operations retained better soil conditions and a better organic matter status. The chemical properties significantly affected by management (total N. Ca, Mg, Fe, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and potential acidity [PA]) all had their highest values in the semi-direct management system.

At the beginning of the process, restored soils are mechanically labile and susceptible to compaction. In this study, we monitored the regeneration of some physical soil quality indicators (bulk density, coarse porosity, penetration resistance) and the development of indicators of mechanical stability (precompression stress, compression index) of a refilled sandy loam originating from an Eutric Cambisol. In particular, we derived multiple linear regression equations to correlate precompression stress and compression index to soil texture, gravel content, organic carbon content and void ratio. During the 3-year observation period after restoration, bulk density and penetration resistance increased significantly, while coarse porosity decreased significantly. Nonetheless, these parameters remained in a range, which is considered to indicate suitable physical soil conditions for root growth over the entire period of observation. Precompression stress increased significantly in the topsoil as well as in the subsoil. The compression index was significantly higher in the topsoil than the subsoil and stayed fairly constant over the observation period. Precompression stress was negatively and the compression index was positively correlated with initial void ratio and to coarse porosity. Taking additional parameters into account, such as gravel content, clay content, silt content and organic matter content, improved the correlation with precompression stress. The equations derived with multiple linear regression analysis from our data set gave a satisfactory coefficient of determination for the compression index (r(2) = 0.81), but rather poor estimates for precompression stress (r(2) = 0.50).

Lime and gypsum are commonly used to improve soil chemical fertility, but no information exists about the long-term effects of these products on the physical attributes and C protection mechanisms of highly weathered Oxisols. A field trial was conducted in a sandy clay loam (kaolinitic, thermic Typic Haplorthox) under a no-tillage system for 12 years. The trial consisted of four treatments: a control with no soil amendment application, the application of 2.1 Mg ha (-1) phosphogypsum, the application of 2.0 Mg ha(-1) lime, and the application of lime + phosphogypsum (2.0 + 2.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Since the experiment was established in 2002, the rates have been applied three times (2002, 2004, and 2010). Surface liming effectively increased water-stable aggregates > 2.0 mm at a depth of up to 0.2 m; however, the association with phosphogypsum was considered a good strategy to improve the macroaggregate stability in subsoil layers (0.20 to 0.40 m). Consequently, both soil amendments applied together increased the mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) in all soil layers, with increases of up to 118 and 89%, respectively, according to the soil layer. The formation and stabilization of larger aggregates contributed to a higher accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC) on these structures. In addition to TOC, the MWD and aggregate stability index were positively correlated with Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels and base saturation. Consequently, the increase observed in the aggregate size class resulted in a better organization of soil particles, increasing the macroporosity and reducing the soil bulk density and penetration resistance. Therefore, adequate soil chemical management plays a fundamental role in improving the soil's physical attributes in tropical areas under conservative management and highly affected by compaction caused by intensive farming.","Calonego, Juliano C.; Carmeis Filho, Antonio C.

The objective of this study was to develop a sensitive soil quality index (SQI) based on bulk density (BD), water-holding capacity (WHC), water-stable aggregates (WSA), aggregate mean weight diameter (AMWD), total organic C (TOC) and C input to evaluate the important rice-wheat cropping system on an Inceptisol in India. A long-term experiment has been conducted for 18 years at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research, Modipuram, India. The treatments selected for this study were comprised of a no-fertilizer control and N, P and K fertilizers (NPK) combined with Zn and S fertilizers (NPK Zn S), farmyard manure (NPK FYM), green gram residues (NPK GR) and cereal residues (NPK + CR), laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for BD, WHC, WSA and TOC. Correlation analysis revealed that both rice and wheat yields significantly increased with the increases in AMWD, TOC and C input, but decreased with the increase in BD. The SQI values were then generated based on regression analysis of BD, WSA, AMWD, TOC and C input with rice and wheat yields for the 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil layers, respectively. Regression analyses between crop yields and SQI values showed a quadratic type of relation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) varying from 0.78 to 0.89. With regard to soil sustainability, applying crop residues to both rice and wheat could maintain soil quality for a longer period, whereas the highest yields of both the crops were recorded in the NPK Zn S treatment. The regression equations developed in this study could be used to monitor soil quality in a subhumid tropical rice-wheat cropping system.","Ahmed, Mukhtar; Barman, Arijit; Chakraborty, Debashis; Das, Bappa; Singh, Amit Kumar; Singh, Vinod Kumar",,26,2016,,,

Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the physical quality of an anionic Acrustox in Guaira, Sao Paulo state, under the following treatments: no-tillage with irrigation, no-tillage without irrigation, crop-pasture rotation, conventional tillage, and native forest. The organic matter content, aggregate stability, soil bulk density, porosity and index S were evaluated. Results showed that human intervention reduced the soil quality and that no-tillage led to no increase in organic matter contents, but it did increase aggregation indices as compared with conventional tillage. In the no-tillage system plus irrigation, the aggregate stability increased in all evaluated soil layers and there also was gains in macropore volume in the 0-0.10 m soil layer over time.

The objective of this study was to evaluate soil and nutrient losses in different soil tillage systems in a typic Acric Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). On five plots with the following soil tillage treatments were evaluated: conventional tillage and down-slope tillage (CMA); conventional tillage and contour seeding (CEN); tillage with one passage of heavy disk harrow and one passage of leveling harrow and contour seeding (CNiv); tillage with two passages of leveling harrow and contour seeding (NA) and no tillage and contour seeding (CMN). The soil losses were determined by the direct method during the cotton crop cycle, from December 2005 to June 2006. Along each runoff sampling, soil samples were withdrawn to quantify the losses of N, P, K and organic carbon (C-org) in the sediments. Decreasing soil tillage lessened the losses of sediments, nutrients and organic carbon, indicating that the CMN treatment was the most efficient. The trends for N, P, K and C-org losses in the sediments were similar to the soil losses. N, P and K varied according to the fertilizers used. The constituent with the highest concentration in the sediment was C in organic compounds. The basic infiltration rate differed among the treatments in the following order: CMA < CEN congruent to CNiv congruent to NA < CMN, indicating that tillage systems that reduced soil revolving and increased organic C, increased the basic infiltration rate and decreased soil erosion.","Couto, Eduardo Guimaraes; Maraschin, Lucas; Silva Amorim, Ricardo Santos; Siqueira Leite, Marcelo Henrique; da Costa, Eduardo Lenza",,33,2009,,,

The aim of this study was to quantify and interpret the effects of varied agricultural reclamation methods in order to assess which of the treatments yielded higher soil quality with respect to its physical state. Basic physical and chemical parameters (texture, particle and bulk density, total porosity, total organic carbon and pH), soil water characteristic curves, water and air permeability, structure of the soil damaged by mining in the area of internal dumping ground Patnow (Central Poland) were therefore measured. The soil samples were taken from the following 5 different variants of over 30 year-long reclamation: black fallow (BF), monoculture of winter wheat (WW), monoculture of winter wheat with a single application in 1992 of lignite dust (WW + L), monoculture of alfalfa with orchard grass in the proportion of 90/10% (A+ G), and spontaneous succession (SS). We collected from each treatment: 12 soil cores for soil water and air properties; 6-kg composite bulk samples for basic physical and chemical properties of soil; 1 undisturbed soil block for structure analysis. The reclamation methods applied on the post-mining grounds influenced in a diverse manner the physical state of the 0-10 cm layer of the developed technogenic soil. Bulk density values generally decreased with the increase of number of factors potentially loosening the soil structure. The studied plots had sandy loam or loamy sand texture which determined their overall air and water properties. The soils were characterized by high macroporosity and favourable content of water available for plants. Less beneficial conditions of the soil were associated with air and water permeability. The present studies indicated that spontaneous succession, with the highest typological diversity of vegetation, contributed to the most preferred soil physical state. Remaining variants of reclamation (including black fallow without vegetation) also provided sufficient air and water relations in the soils. However, it should be emphasised that plants play an important role in TOC accumulation and ensuring relative stability of soil structure. Therefore rehabilitation of post-mining grounds involving vegetation is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A 10-year experiment was conducted in Linfen on the Loess Plateau to assess the potential benefits of controlled traffic oil agricultural production. In this region, long-term traditional ploughing with straw removal has resulted in a decline of soil productivity and poor soil structure. Several treatments were compared: controlled traffic with no-tillage and straw cover (NTSC), controlled traffic with shallow tillage and straw cover, and traditional tillage (TT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Results show clear benefits of controlled traffic farming. Winter wheat growth in ploughed Plots Was Much slower than in controlled traffic plots. Mean yield from 1998 to 2007 was 11.2% lower for traditional tillage than for controlled traffic plots. The best results were achieved by a no-tillage straw cover and controlled traffic system (NTSC), which resulted in the greatest benefits to soil Structure after 10 years. The NTSC significantly improved soil organic matter content in the top 30 cut by 27.2%, total N by 10.8%, and available P (top 10 cm) by 92.3% compared with TT. Aeration (>60 mu m) and capillary porosity (2-60 mu m) were 155.0%, and 16.1% greater, respectively, in NTSC plots than in TT plots. Consequently, for NTSC, final water infiltration rates were 67.4% greater than for TT, whereas water content in the top 130 cm was 14.9% higher than in TT, respectively. We conclude therefore that controlled traffic combined with no-tillage and straw cover is a valuable system for restoring soil productivity and quality of seriously degraded soils on the Loess Plateau for the sustainable development of agriculture in dryland China.","Bai, Yuhua; Chen, Fu; Chen, Hao; Gong, Yuanshi; He, Jin; Hikel, H.; Kuhn, N.

The effect of additions of dairy cattle (Bos taurus) manure (DCM) during a period of 11 years were evaluated in a soil under irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture. DCM was applied at sowing, at wet-weight rates of 30 or 60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (30DCM or 60DCM). These were compared with a mineral-N treatment (300 kg N ha(-1), MNF), applied at six to eight emerged leaves and with a control (no N, no manure). Treatments were distributed in a randomized block design. Factors analysed were stability against wetting stress disaggregation, porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions and earthworm abundance, studied eight months after the last manure application. The application rate of 30DCM increased aggregate stability and the light SOC fraction, but not the pore volume, nor the earthworm abundance, compared with MNF. The DCM rates did not result in unbalanced agronomic advantages versus MNF, as high yields (12-16 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were obtained. In Mediterranean environments, the use of DCM should be encouraged mainly because of its contribution to the light SOC fraction which protects dry macro-aggregates from implosion (slaking) during the wetting process. Thus, in intensive agricultural systems, it protects soil from physical degradation.

In agriculture, strategies to increase the soil carbon (C) sink include no-tillage, cover crops, and improved crop rotation. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of tillage systems on SOC and total N, soil aggregation and aggregate associated C and N in three soil types: Oxisol (Brazil), Vertisol (Argentina), and Mollisol (USA). Long-term tillage experiments included tilled (T) and no-till (NT) systems. A native grassland was included for comparison in each site. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 0-15, and 15-30 cm depths. Water-stable aggregates (WSA) were separated using a wet-sieving method. Total C and total N were determined by dry combustion. A shift from native grassland to an agroecosystem decreased microbial biomass, but this decrease was less pronounced under NT. Cultivation reduced the mass of macroaggregates and the concentration associated C and N; however among agroecosystems, NT, regardless soil type, tended to be more similar to the native grassland sites. Agroecosystems reduced TOC and total N stocks, regardless of soil type, compared to the native grassland. This effect followed: Mollisol > Oxisol > Vertisol, and was more pronounced at the 0-5 cm soil depth than at deeper depths. This loss of C and N was associated with the decrease in the mass of macroaggregates and lower C and N concentrations of the aggregates. Macroaggregation was related to TOC and microbial biomass in the Mollisol, suggesting that the biological process of aggregate formation is the principal mechanism of C protection in these soils. The relationship between TOC and large macroaggregates showed lower values for the Oxisol and Vertisol, indicating that in these soils TOC has a complementary role in macroaggregation.","Amado, Telmo J.

The objective of this study was to quantify soil quality differences among agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass waterway (GWW), grass buffer (GB), and row crop (RC) areas and distance from the tree base on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) watershed. Soil samples from AGF at 0, 30, 60, 90 cm distances from the tree base, and from AGF, GWW, GB, and RC areas were collected from summit, shoulder, and foot-slope landscape positions at the paired watershed study near Novelty, MO. Soil enzyme activity, WSA, soil C, and N were determined and data were analyzed statistically. The highest SOC and N percentages were found in AGF and the lowest in RC. beta-Glucosidase activity was not significantly different among AGF, GWW, and RC. beta-Glucosaminidase and dehydrogenase activities were significantly lower in RC treatment than all other treatments. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity was not significant among all treatments. WSA percentage was significantly higher in GWW and AGF as compared to others. Landscape position was not significantly different for all measured soil quality parameters. beta-Glucosidase, beta-glucosaminidase activities, WSA, and soil N did not differ significantly with distance from the tree base. SOC and FDA hydrolase activity were significantly lower at the tree base. Results imply that permanent vegetation has improved the soil quality by enhancing soil microbial activity and organic matter accumulation, thereby contribute positively to watershed restoration.","Jose, Shibu; Kremer, Robert J.; Udawatta, Ranjith P.; Weerasekara, Chamara; Weerasekara, Chathuri",,90,2016,,,

Recently, the unsustainability of this system has owing to soil structural deterioration and nutrient depletion, become evident, resulting from continuous puddling on the same piece of land even if recommended inorganic fertilizers have been applying regularly. To regenerate and maintain soil structure in rice fields, farmers in this region frequently use farm yard manure (FYM), but low availability of FYM because of its other uses indicates that it could not meet the organic matter requirements of this system. We evaluated the long-term effects of different locally available jungle grasses and weeds on soil hydro-physical properties and rice yield through a 5-year field experiment (2000 to 2005) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Complex for North Eastern Hilly (NEH) Region, Umiam, Meghalaya, India and also compared their negative or positive effects with FYM in acidic, Typic Hapludalf soil. The objective was to determine whether locally available grasses (Jungle grass) and weeds (Ambrosia sp.) could be used as alternative sources of organic materials for lowland rice in scarcity of FYM. Results showed that incorporation of FYM or jungle grass or Ambrosia sp., continuously for 5 years in puddled rice soil improved soil organic carbon (SOC) by 21.1%; the stability of micro-aggregates, moisture retention capacity, and infiltration rate of the soil by 82.5, 10, and 31.3%, respectively; and soil bulk density decreased by 12.6%. Application of FYM produced better soil physical environment than that under jungle grass and Ambrosia sp. However, as these grasses and weeds contained higher nutrient levels than FYM and increased the SOC slowly, these organics may serve as alternative to FYM and may have a dramatic effect on long-term productivity of rice. The gradual improvement in soil physical properties led to a significantly higher yield of rice. We conclude that applying organic manure or organic residue annually may mitigate the negative effect of puddling and related properties and therefore could contribute to the sustainability of the wetland rice ecosystem.","Mishra, V.

In conventional tillage, there was a decline in TP, PA(1), MWD, infiltration rate and SOC during the experimental period in both farmlands. For NT, the infiltration rate decreased during the season but TP changed slightly; PA(1), MWD and SOC were higher in August compared with the other months. The highest values of NH4+-N and TOP were in June under both tillage systems in both farmlands. Compared with NT, there was higher TP and IIR in CT but lower MWD and SIR in May. As the season progressed, PA(1), MWD and infiltration rate were lower in CT than in NT from June to October. The greatest differences in PA(1) and MWD were observed in August at both sites. There was higher SOC and NH4+-N in NT but lower TOP in CT. There was better soil structure and infiltration rate in the early stage of crop growth in CT, while NT had a beneficial effect on soil structure stability and infiltration capacity at both sites during the growing season.

The experiment was setup in an agricultural area, in April of 1995, with the cultivation of Avena strigossa plus Vicia vilosa, both for conventional system and no-tillage. An area under native grasses and another with native forest were sampled for comparison. Soils samples were collected from the layers of 0-0.05m, 0.10-0.15m and 0.20-0.25m, to determine the soil texture, porosity, densitites, water retention, aggregate stability and distribution, and organic carbon content. The cultivation systems increase the soil bulk density and reduce total prosity, microporosity, water retention and availability, compared with native systems such as garss field and forest. The conventional system redcues organic carbon content and aggregate stability, whereas no-tillage, after five years, increases, somewhat, the organic carbon content in the surface layer, but increases aggregate stability to values near of those for native systems. The aggregate stability had direct realationship with organic carbon content up to an upper limit of 25g kg(-1). The bulk density, macroporosity, S parameter, organic carbon content and aggregate stability are good indicators of the changes observed in the soil management systems. For the Hapludalf formed from granite, there was recovery of the properties related to soil structure stability, but in those related to soil bulk density, and porosity no recovery was observed.","Albuquerque, Jackson Adriano; Flores, Carlos Alberto; Pauletto, Eloy Antonio; Reichert, Jose Miguel; Reinert, Dalvan Jose",,38,2008,,,

In this study, shallow soils were collected from 50-year-old monoculture treatments of undisturbed (Dendrocalamus calostachyus, Mangifera indica and Saccharwn munja Roxb.) and disturbed (Oryza sativa cultivated field) land use. Our results showed that compared with undisturbed soils, soils under the disturbed use dramatically depleted in SOC, particulate OC (POC), non-particulate OC (NPOC), GRSP, easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and difficulty extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP). The depletion in labile POC was found to be little higher than physically protected NPOC, and were almost similar among the fractions of GRSP (each decreased by 50%). Further, a linear correlation was found among the fractions of GRSP and SOC, and in turn resulted in the similar relationship with soils bulk density, porosity, pH, available phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic nitrogen's, cations (calcium and potassium), arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) abundance, and with microbial activity. These results indicate that the factors involve in SOC accumulation simultaneously encourage AM proliferation and in turn GRSP enrichment. Apart from this, the higher contribution of GRSP-C in NPOC (13 to 17%), tended to increase with decreasing soil disturbance, suggesting the role of GRSP in accumulation and stabilization of SOC in this zone. A two component factor structure showed component 1 considerably occupied by fractions of GRSP, SOC and those other variables favouring GRSP and SOC, primarily scored by undisturbed (M. indica and D. calostachyus treatments) soils. The second component which has fewer influence over soil variables, considerably occupied by microbial activity, electrical conductivity, cations and nutrients (available nitrogen, phosphorus) was also exemplified by undisturbed soils (except D. calostachyus treatment). Thus, improving GRSP and SOC stock in disturbed agricultural soil in studied area is of urgent requirement for the long-term goal of C sequestration and sustainable soil health. Our finding should stimulate managernent plans for degraded lands aimed at recovering the landscape heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The additional conservational practices have not been fully adopted in the no-tillage system as it would be required to control the erosion potential due to the soil conditions of these regions. Runoff results in chemically enriched sediments, which poses environmental risks, besides causing economical losses in the agriculture production system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of vertical mulching as a conservation practice to restrict runoff in areas under no-tillage system, by evaluating the sediment enrichment rate based on double soil sampling in fields with presence and absence ofthe practice of vertical mulching. The double sampling covered representative soils of each plantation and the respective sediments generated by hydric erosion. Soil pH in water, SMP index, available P, exchangeable K, Ca, Mg and Al, and organic matter were determined, and the total and base saturation and cation exchange capacity in each sample were calculated. Results indicate that the conservation practice of vertical mulching reduces the degree of chemical enrichment ofthe sediments and mainly prevents the transport of these sediments away from plantations, minimizing economical losses and environmental risks. The no tillage system, without complementary conservation practices to control runoff, does therefore not represent a soil conservation practice capable of preventing environmental degradation.","Denardin, Jose Eloir; Faganello, Antonio; Kochhann, Rainoldo Alberto; Manhago, Diego Denardin; Sattler, Areenio",,32,2008,,,

However, in the Northern Great Plains, little information is available to quantify the effects of soil texture on the C sequestration potential of soils. This work was conducted to develop relationships for C sequestration potential based on soil texture under a variety of agricultural practices. Soil samples were collected from central and southeast North Dakota from sites with differing soil management and cropping systems; this includes native prairie, differing Conservation Reserve Program year classes, no-till, and conventional tillage practices. Particle size analysis was determined on the 0- to 15-cm soil depth using a hydrometer method. Sand fractions were determined by sieving. Carbon analysis was done by a high temperature combustion method. For all sampled soils, total silt (%) was found to be positively correlated (P <= 0.01) to organic C content (percent organic C) and organic C mass (kg m(-2) depth(-1)). Sand was found to be negatively correlated (P <= 0.10) with% organic C and organic Cmass. Soil clay content was correlated with organic C mass (P <= 0.05) but not percent organic C. Bulk density was found to be negatively correlated with percent organic C (P <= 0.10). The strong correlation between silt content and soil organic C reflects the greater water holding capacity and plant available water of silt-dominated soils, which, in turn, affect plant productivity and influences C sequestration in soil.","Augustin, Christopher; Cihacek, Larry J.",,181,2016,,,

Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from four sites. The effects of agricultural practices on soil properties taken from each three adjacent land use types were most clearly detected in the past 50 years with the land use change. Land use change and subsequent tillage practices resulted in significant decreases in organic matter, total porosity, total nitrogen and reduced soil aggregates stability. However, contents of available P were improved by application of phosphorous fertilizers in cultivated system. There was also a significant change in bulk density among cultivated, pasture and natural forest soils. Depending upon the increase in bulk density and disruption of pores by cultivation, total porosity decreased accordingly. The data show that long term continuous cultivation of the natural forest soils resulted in changes in physical and chemical characteristics of soils.","Dengiz, Orhan; Gol, Ceyhun",,29,2008,,,

The value of compost applied at rates lower than those required to supply crop nutrient needs requires investigation because applying compost at agronomic nitrogen rates may not be economically feasible for organic vegetable producers. We conducted field research during 2000-2002 on a Luvisol to compare the nutrient and non-nutrient effects of various rates and timings of mixed poultry litter-yard waste compost with a traditional organic fertilizer (poultry litter) and inorganic fertilizer on environmental soil attributes and water quality in an organic vegetable crop rotation. Soil organic C, total N, and available P increased 60%,68%, and 225%, respectively, above the control with the application of 144 Mg ha(-1) compost (dry wt.) during the 3-year study, but the low rate of compost (31 Mg ha(-1)) did not affect soil C or N. Compost IN mineralization was not synchronous with sweet corn N assimilation, resulting in excess root zone nitrate that would have posed a leaching risk without the use of a winter rye N-scavenging cover crop. The concentrations of nitrate N that leached below the tillage zone occasionally exceeded the 10 mg L(-1) health standard but were not different among the agronomic rates of compost, poultry litter, fertilizer, and control treatments for nearly every sampling event. Despite increasing runoff water concentrations of N and P, the high compost rate reduced the amounts of N and P that were transported from the soil surface by five-fold and four-fold, respectively, compared to the inorganic fertilizer due to a four-fold reduction in runoff volume.

The highest weed density was recorded in conservation tillage systems (MT and/or NT) several years after the implementation of these systems. Additionally, the cumulative effects of conservation tillage techniques were found to have increased the seed density and species diversity in soil seed bank, which was probably due to particular conditions created in the soil; a low or negligible level of soil disturbance (as is expected with MT and NT) possibly allowed seeds to keep in the soil seed bank and remain dormant, due to, among other reasons, improved water stable aggregates and organic matter content.

Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are important management strategies for tackling the issues of soil health deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources, particularly in rice based intensive crop rotations. The conservation agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term study was conducted to evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03) and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, PB and conventional tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS: Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-MustardMungbean, MMS: Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC, physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7 years of continuous ZT, PB and CT in diversified maize rotations. Compared to Cr plots, the soil physical properties like water stable aggregates (WSA) > 250 mu m were 16.1-32.5% higher, and bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P < 0.05) decline (11.0-14.3 and 11.2-12.0%) in ZT and PB plots at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34.6-35.3% at 0-15 cm, and 23.6-26.5% at 15-30 cm soil depths with conservation agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT. Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under CA based systems increased by 45-48.9% in 0-30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P < 0.05) improvement in soil enzymatic activities i.e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, beta Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the CA based treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were observed on SOC,WSA, BD, PR and Ksat at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths. Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P < 0.05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that CA based crop management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and MWMb) can be advocated as sustainable intensification strategy in light textured soils of north-western India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia.

However, residue harvest must be weighed against potential negative impacts on soil quality. This study, conducted in Chazy, NY, evaluated the long-term effects of 32 yr of maize (Zea mays L.) stover harvest vs. stover return on soil quality in the surface layer (5-66 mm) under plow till (PT) and no-till (NT) systems on a Raynham silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Aeric Epiaquept) using physical, chemical, and biological soil properties as soil quality indicators. Twenty-five soil properties were measured, including standard chemical soil tests, aggregate stability (WSA), bulk density (rho(b)) penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), infiltrability (Infilt), several porosity indicators (aeration pores(PO > 1000), soil water potential = Psi > -0.36 kPa; air-filled pores at field capacity (PO > 30), Psi > -10kPa; available water capacity (AWC), -1500 < Psi < -10 kPa), total organic matter (OM), parasitic (Nem(Parasitic)) and beneficial nematode (Nem(Beneficial)) populations, decomposition rate (Decomp), potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and easily extractable (EEG) and total glomalin (TG). Only eight indicators were adversely affected by stover harvest, and most of these effects were significant only under NT Almost all indicators affected by stover removal were affected equally or more adversely by tillage. A total of 15 indicators were adversely affected by tillage. Results of this study suggest that, on a silt loam soil in a temperate climate, long-term stover harvest had lower adverse impacts on soil quality than long-term tillage. Stover harvest appears to be sustainable when practiced under NT management.","Abawi, George S.; Gugino, Beth K.; Idowu, Omololu J.; Lucey, Robert; Moebius-Clune, Bianca N.; Moebius-Clune, Daniel J.; Schindelbeck, Robert R.; Thies, Janice E.; Wolfe, David W.; van Es, Harold M.",,72,2008,,,

In 1994, the Department of Plant Production of the Slovak Agricultural University in Nitra established a long-term field experiment in locality Dolna Malanta. In 1994-2007, the soil samples were collected from the depth 0-0.3 m. The field experiment included two types of soil tillage (conventional tillage-CT and reduced tillage-RT) and three variants of fertilization (1. C-o-without fertilization, 2. PR + NPK-crop residues together with added NPK fertilizers, 3. NPK-with added NPK fertilizers). Different tillage and fertilization had statistically significant influence on changes of the soil pH and soil sorptive complex. The values of pH were more favourable in RT than in CT. In NPK (by 26%) and in PR + NPK (by 21%) decreased values of hydrolytic acidity. On the other hand it increased the sum of basic cations. This led to the increase of cation exchangeable capacity. In comparison to CT, a higher total carbon concentration (Q) was determined in RT. According to vulnerability coefficient (K-v), the soil structure stability was better in RT (4.64 +/- 1.54) than in CT (5.15 +/- 1.75). Average value of WSA(ma) was higher by 9% in RT and it led to increasing of the sum of mean weight diameters of water-stable aggregates (MWD-WSA) by 11% and increasing of index stability (S-w) by 12%. We determined linear dependences between C-t and critic level of soil organic matter concentration (S-t) in CT and RT as well as in PR + NPK and NPK. The negative correlation between Ca2+ and S-t (-0.507(..)) and positive correlation between Ca2+ and crusting index (0.525(..)) were detected in CT. The values of Ca2+ were in positive correlation with crusting index (0.363(.)) in RT.

The evolution of soil structural characteristics (silt loam Gypsic Haploxerept) throughout this period and corresponding changes in water availability were studied. Five years were not time enough to notice changes in soil parameters. However, 11 years more revealed major changes, macroporosity (pores >60 mu m) decreased dramatically (from 20.5 to 9.4%); mesoporosity (60 to 10 mu m) increased and macroporosity (<10 mu m) is unchanged. Notably, more water was available for plants (from 6% in 2008 to 10% in 2014). This was led by a significant decrease in the volume of water that is strongly bounded to very small pores (<0.2 mu m). This is considered particularly important in this semiarid area having less than 400 mm of annual rainfall. These changes were more pronounced in soils with shrubs, particularly A. halimus.

We conducted a multiple-year investigation of how cover crop management (grazed and ungrazed) and tillage system [conventional (CT; initial moldboard plowing and thereafter disk tillage) and no tillage (NIT)] affected soil physical properties (bulk density, aggregation, infiltration, and penetration resistance) on a Typic Kanhapludult in Georgia. Responses were determined in two cropping systems: summer grain/winter cover crop and winter grain/ summer cover crop. Soil bulk density was reduced (P = 0.02) with CT compared with NT to a depth of 30 cm at the end of 0.5 year, but only to a depth of 12 cm at the end of 2, 2.5. and 4.5 years. Grazing of cover crops had little effect on soil bulk density, except eventually with 4.5 years of management. Water-stable macroaggregation was reduced (P <= 0.01) with CT compared with NT to a depth of 12 cm at all sampling times during the first 2.5 years of evaluation. Stability of macroaggregates in water was unaffected by grazing of cover crops in both tillage systems. Across 7 sampling events during the first 4 years, there was a tendency (P = 0.07) for water infiltration rate to be lower with grazing of cover crops (5.6 mm rnin(-1)) than when ungrazed (6.9 mm min(-1)), irrespective of tillage system. Across 10 sampling events, soil penetration resistance was greater under NT than under CT at a depth of 0-10 cm (P = 0.001) and the difference was greater in ungrazed than in grazed systems (P = 0.06). Biannual CT operations may have alleviated any surface degradation with animal traffic, but the initially high level of soil organic matter following long-term pasture and conversion to cropland with NIT may have buffered the soil from any detrimental effects of animal traffic.

At the same time this practice is also damaging the soil in the long-term. In this work the feasibility of using composts as total or partial substitutes for conventional inorganic fertilization (CIF) was evaluated in two successive crops of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), one of the most consumed vegetables in Europe. The aim was to offer alternative agricultural practices that are more environmentally friendly. Treatments consisting of various rates of inorganic and organic fertilizers (composts) were assayed in quadruplicate on a sandy loam soil classified as Haplic Calcisol in Southern Spain. Macro- and micronutrients and heavy metal concentrations were analysed in soil and plant leaves. Parameters such as soil basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass C (C-mic) and dehydrogenase (DHA) and hydrolase activities, indicators of soil microbial abundance and activity, were also determined after each crop. After the second lettuce crop, certain physical soil properties such as aggregate stability and soil water holding capacity were also determined. In the first crop lettuce yields in the compost-treated soils did not significantly (p <= 0.05) differ from the yields of CIF-treated soils. In the second crop, however, lettuce yields were higher in organically treated soils than in soils receiving only inorganic fertilization. Organic fertilizers were able to supply sufficient nutrients to achieve similar yields as those obtained with additional inorganic fertilizer. After the second, crop, organically treated soils also showed higher C, N, P concentrations and higher C-mic, BR and DHA than soils receiving conventional inorganic fertilization as well as improved physical conditions (a higher percentage of stable soil aggregates and a greater water holding capacity). Also after the second lettuce crop, compost-treated soils showed significantly higher beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activity than CIF-treated soils. Furthermore, lettuces grown in compost treated soils showed significantly lower leaf nitrate concentration than lettuces grown in soil receiving CIF, thus reducing the potential toxicological risks associated with consuming nitrate-rich foods. Moreover, compost fertilization did not increase the concentration of heavy metals in lettuce leaves. Results confirm that manure and sewage sludge composts can be used as an alternative to inorganic fertilization in lettuce crop cultivation, leading to similar or even higher yields and reducing nutrient leaching risks, while improving soil chemical, physical and microbiological properties.

We decided to use dry sieved aggregates since this technique is commonly used in semiarid regions. The study was carried out at Anguil, La Pampa, Argentina. The soil was a sandy loam Entic Haplustoll with a carbonate-free A-horizon. The PAS site had been under weeping love grass for more than 40 years. Parts of this PAS were turned to cultivation in 1989 (CULT14) and in 2001 (CULT2). Sampling was carried out at 0.6 m intervals to 0.18 m depth. Bulk density (BD), organic carbon (OC), and water holding capacity and infiltration were determined on these samples. Dry aggregate size distribution and OC content of the size fractions were determined on large undisturbed samples. Samples of pooled aggregate size fractions > 4, 1-4, and < 1 mm, as well as corresponding samples of non fractionated soil were incubated and respiration was measured by CO2 evolved. The soil of CULT2 had 29% lower contents of large (> 4 mm) and 37% higher contents of very small (< 1 mm) aggregates than PAS. The intermediate size aggregates were not affected by the short-term effect of tillage. OC loss in CULT2 was 16% regarding PAS. Longer term effects of cultivation were characterized by 30% loss of intermediate size aggregates, 22% increase of bulk density, 74 and 19% decrease in water infiltration and water retention, respectively of CULT14 compared to PAS. A 32% decrease of OC was observed after 14 years of cultivation. Intermediate size aggregates had highest OC contents and no difference between treatments was found, except for a lower value of large aggregates in CULT14. Respiration rates and total CO2 evolved was related to OC contents of fractions; however, PAS respired more from its small aggregates than expected from their OC content. The results showed that OC turnover and loss of aggregation was very fast in this soil, but soil hydraulic properties were affected in the longer term. Dry aggregates were found to useful for studying soil degradation, and they showed similar trends as those indicated in the literature for water stable aggregates. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We measured the mineralization of OC in total soils and aggregates after 27 years of application of various fertilizers in a highland agroecosystem in central China and calculated the temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization. Our objectives were to understand the effects of long-term fertilization on OC mineralization in aggregates and its temperature sensitivity, and to determine the contribution of each aggregate size class to OC mineralization in total soils. Long-term fertilization decreased cumulative mineralized OC (C-min) in <0.053 mm size class but increased C-min in >2, 0.25-2, and 0.053-0.25 mm aggregates. The increases were smaller in treatments with mineral fertilizers than with manure or manure combined with mineral fertilizer. The temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization was decreased in >2 mm aggregate but increased in <2 mm aggregates and total soils by fertilization treatments. The OC mineralization in <0.053 mm size class accounted for 36% of the OC mineralization in total soils. Manure or manure combined with mineral fertilizer had a higher potential to change the contribution of aggregates to OC mineralization in total soils. Our results suggest that OC mineralization in total soils was determined mainly by mineralization in the <0.053 mm size class of these highland agricultural soils, and long-term fertilization increased the temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization in total soils and <2 mm aggregates.

Application of fertilizer N, P, farmyard manure (FYM) and crop residues (CR) significantly increased water-stable aggregates and had profound effect in increasing the mean weight diameter as well as the formation of macro-aggregates. After 2 years of soybean-rapeseed rotation under CA practices, the formation of macro-aggregates was the highest in both surface (84 %) and subsurface (80 %) soil layers with application of 20 kg N+60 kg P2O5 + 10 t FYM+4t rapeseed residue ha(-1) applied to soybean and 100 kg N+30 kg P2O5+3 t soybean residue ha(-1) applied to rapeseed crop, respectively, and the corresponding values in CT were 83 and 77 %. The same treatment also enhanced total organic C from 4.5 g kg(-1) in control to 6.4 g kg(-1) in surface layer and from 3.3 to 4.4 g kg(-1) in subsurface layer after 4 years in CA practices.

These results suggest that CA that integrates application of inorganic fertilizer, organic manure, retention of CR as soil cover, and minimum tillage is tremendously beneficial for soil health due to its positive effects on aggregation processes, augmenting organic matter accumulation and protecting within soil aggregates, and significantly enhancing biological pools in semiarid subtropical soils.","Aulakh, Milkha S.; Garg, Ashok K.; Kumar, Shrvan",,5,2016,,,

There were significant differences in soil properties and quality under different treatments after four year of plantation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher in sole Grewia (1.45 cm h(-1)) plots followed by that under agroforestry plots (0.80-0.95 cm hr(-1)). Soil bulk density was least in sole Grewia plot (1.40 mg m(-3)) and was highest (1.50 mg m(-3)) in fallow plots. Water stable aggregates were 16-18 % higher in agroforestry plots.

A decline in soil structure quality was found in a conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring, organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall increases in earthworm density (84%), earthworm biomass (80%) and the density of earthworm channels (132%) in the topsoil between 1994 and 2004. Most of these increases were found in systems with 1-3 years of ley in the 4-year rotation. Low values of all earthworm parameters, and only minor changes over the period studied, were found in two non-organic arable systems without ley, indicating high pressure on soil fauna. Lower earthworm activity was found in the non-organic arable system with reduced tillage as compared to the non-organic arable system with annual ploughing. Thus, 50% leys in the rotation appeared desirable for the maintenance of satisfactory soil structure and earthworm activity. Though the deterioration of soil structure in the conventional arable system was not extreme, as the soil was well structured initially, the results may have implications for the sustainability of stockless arable systems on soils with a less favourable initial structure.

In this study, we examined the WSA sizes and stability, and soil organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents in agricultural lands with abandonment ages of 0, 3, 12, 20, 30 and 40 years, respectively, in the Minqin Oasis of Northwest China. The total soil OC and N contents at depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in abandoned agricultural lands were compared to those in cultivated land (the control). Agricultural land abandonment significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the distribution of MWD (mean weight diameter), and OC and N contents. There were significant increases in MWD and the proportion of macroaggregates (sizes > 0.25 mm) as the age of agricultural land abandonment increased. The effect of abandonment ages of agricultural lands on MWD was determined by the changes of OC and N accumulation in WSA sizes > 2 mm. The total OC and N contents presented a stratification phenomenon across soil depths in this arid ecosystem. That is, both of them decreased significantly at depths of 0-20 and 40-60 cm while increased at the depth of 20-40 cm. The WSA sizes < 0.053 mm had the highest soil OC and N contents (accounting for 51.41%-55.59% and 42.61%-48.94% of their total, respectively). Soil OC and N contents in microaggregates (sizes 0.053-0.25 mm) were the dominant factors that influenced the variations of total OC and N contents in abandoned agricultural lands. The results of this study suggested that agricultural land abandonment may result in the recovery of WSA stability and the shifting of soil organic matter from the silt+clay (< 0.053 mm) and microaggregate fractions to the macroaggregate fractions. However, agricultural land abandonment did not increase total soil OC and N contents in the short-term.","Junqiang, Wang; Lichao, Liu; Xiaoqing, Qiu; Yanrong, Li; Yujie, Wei; Zhiguo, Shi",,8,2016,,,

This study was conducted to quantify the long-term effects of continuous crop production under different cropping systems with different crop rotations on physical properties of alluvial clay soil in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Soil samples were collected from four treatments: (i) traditional intensive rice monoculture with three rice crops per year (R-R-R); (ii) rotation with two rice crops and maize (R-M-R); (iii) rotation with two rice crops and mung bean (R-Mb-R); and (iv) rotation with one rice and two upland crops, mung bean and maize (R-Mb-M). We hypothesized that cropping systems with rotations of upland crops and their temporary beds improve the physical quality of paddy rice soil; hence, they are better options towards sustainable agriculture. Results show an improvement of soil physical quality for systems with two rice crops and one upland crop (R-M-R and R-Mb-R) and those with one rice crop with two upland crops (R-Mb-M) compared with intensive rice monoculture (R-R-R). This was translated in decreased bulk density and soil strength, increased soil organic carbon and total porosity, and higher aggregate stability index, plant-available water capacity, and Dexter's S index, especially at depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm. The systems with different upland crops (maize or mung bean) showed similar high physical quality improvement. To maintain soil quality in future seasons, introducing a cropping system with at least one upland crop in rotation with rice is recommended.

Site-specific management zones (SSMZ) were investigated as a means of improving nitrogen management in irrigated maize cropping systems. The objective was to develop precise nutrient management strategies for semi-arid irrigated cropping systems. This study was conducted in five fields in northeastern Colorado, USA. Two techniques for delineating management zones were developed and compared: SSMZ and yield-based management zones (YBMZ). Nitrogen uptake and grain yield differences among SSMZs were compared as were soil properties. Both management zone techniques were used to divide fields into smaller units that were different with regard to productivity potential (e.g., high zones had high productivity potential while low zones had low productivity potential). Economic analysis was also performed. Based on grain yield productivity, the SSMZs performed better than the YBMZ technique in most cases. Grain yield and N uptake between the low and high productivity management zones were statistically different for most site-years and N fertilizer rates (p < 0.05). Soil properties helped to explain the productivity potential of the management zones. The low SSMZ was markedly different from the high SSMZ based on bulk density, organic carbon, sand, silt, porosity and soil moisture. Net returns ranged from 188 to 679 USD ha(-1). In two out of three site-years the variable yield goal strategy resulted in the largest net returns. In this study, the SSMZ approach delineates areas of different productivity accurately across the agricultural fields. The SSMZs are different with regard to soil properties as well as grain yield and N uptake. Site-specific management zones are an inexpensive and pragmatic approach to precise N management in irrigated maize.","Frasier, M.; Hornung, A.; Inman, D.; Khosla, R.; Koch, B.; Mzuku, M.; Reich, R.

The evolution of some soil chemical parameters has been studied in two long-term trials established in the early 1960s in north-eastern Italy: one (SF) comparing nutrient management treatments (i.e. organic, mineral and mixed fertilizers) in lysimeters containing widely contrasting soil types (i.e. sand, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field study with crop rotation, nutrient (organic vs. mineral fertilizers), and management intensity variables. Soil was analysed for Olsen phosphorus (P-av), exchangeable cations (K-ex, Na-ex, Mg-ex, and Ca-ex) and salinity, evaluated by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). A bi-factorial quality index based on fuzzy logic was then tested and applied to assess the overall soil quality and its evolution in the cropping systems. A minimum dataset of chemical (pH, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, P-av and K-ex) and physical parameters (available water content and water-filled porosity) was used to elaborate the index. In general, the use of organic fertilizer resulted in higher P-av, K-ex and Mg-ex concentrations than the mineral treatments at the same levels, whereas no differences for Na-ex and Ca-ex were observed. Salinity level was not influenced by the organic treatments probably because the consistent water drainage in the area prevented salt accumulation. The soil quality index represented the soil productivity function, explaining up to 74% of yield variability. Index comparison highlighted the positive role of organic and mixed fertilizations in increasing and maintaining the soil quality. The bi-factorial index of soil quality based on a minimum dataset is a good tool for the policy maker to evaluate the effects of management practices. However, standardization and accuracy of the soil analyses are important to reduce sources of variability that could have a strong influence on the soil quality evaluation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this studywas to investigate impacts of long-term (>75 years) grazing at 1.18 heads ha(-1) (heavy; CGH), 0.78 heads ha(-1) (light; CGL), and exclosure on selected soil properties. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 60 cm from the long-term experimental site of Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute, Eastern Cape. The samples were analyzed for C, N, bulk density and infiltration rate, among others. RESULTS: Generally, heavy and light grazing reduced soil N storage by 27.5% and 22.6%, respectively, compared with the exclosure. Animal exclusion improved water infiltration rate and C stocks significantly (P < 0.05), which was 0.128, 0.097, and 0.093 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for exclosure, CGL and CGH, respectively. Soil penetration resistance was higher for grazing treatments in the top 3-7 cm soil layer but for exclosure at the top 1 cmsoil surface. CONCLUSION: Although livestock exclusion has the potential to improve C sequestration, a sufficient resting period for 1-2 years followed by three consecutive grazing years at light stocking rate would be ideal for sustainable livestock production in this arid region of South Africa.

On average, buffer samples had a 33% higher characteristic coordination number than RC samples. Buffer samples had a.higher characteristic path length constant (2.18 times the RC treatment) and an average lower path tortuosity (89% of the RC treatment) relative to values for RC.

Five fields under CA applied for 2 years (CA(2) (yr)) and 5 years (CA(5) (yr)), respectively, were paired with adjacent RT fields with similar soil type and maize genotypes. Soils samples from the 20 fields were taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm and evaluated for physical and chemical characteristics. The results of analysis of variance and mean comparison showed that soil bulk density and total porosity (PORt) largely remained the same between CA and RT fields. Soil structural stability (SI) was marginally greater under CA practices while RT appeared to sustain better soil aggregation and root-zone aeration characteristics (air capacity, AC). CA(5) (yr) fields showed greater values for soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen, available phosphorous, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Volumetric water content at field capacity (theta(fc)) and relative water capacity (RWC) were consistently greater under CA applied for the different number of years. The most influential soil attributes with loadings within ten per cent of those with the highest loadings based on multivariate principal component analysis were theta(fc), theta(pwp), theta(s), upper critical bulk density (rho(bU)), OC, OC-stock, SI, RWC, AC, theta(fc)/PORt, CEC, and K. Thus, soil attributes found as the most important to discriminate either management system were related to volumetric water content, soil organic carbon fraction, air water storage, and chemical qualities. These were considered suitable for future assessment of soil quality for monitoring land use change effects in similar agroecosystems. The study posits study of socio-ecology of mulch cover practices to attribute management effects on soil properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Makwiza, C. N.; Mloza-Banda, H.

As decomposition and soil formation progress, bulk density (rho(b)) increases and total porosity (f(t)) decreases due to subsidence, shrinkage, and mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). However, the rate of subsidence and the changes in soil properties differ among management systems. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different tillage practices on rho(b) and f(t) of cultivated peat soils. These experiments were conducted during 2004-2005, on Histosols in north central Ohio. Soil core samples were obtained from experimental plots managed with moldboard plow (MB), no-till (NT), or left bare (B).

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate, after three years, the structural state of a soil (Typic Haploxerand) subjected to four techniques for managing crop residues under zero tillage in wheat-oat rotation: 1) burned residues (T); 2) residues in rows (RH); 3) standing residues (RP); and 4) chopped residues (RPC). The evaluated variables were soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregates stability measured by mean weight diameter (MWD), distribution of water stable aggregates, saturated water conductivity (K-s), bulk density (D-a), and resistance to penetration (Rp). The experimental design was complete random blocks and means were compared with the Tukey test (p <= 0.05). The results showed a low MWD (0.20 to 0.28 mm) and a dominance of water stable fractions smaller than 0.25 mm that was above 66% in all of the treatments. This suggests that the structural system is susceptible to physical degradation; RP and RPC had better structural stability and a higher proportion (p <= 0.05) of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm), as well as a significant increase in SOC (p <= 0.05). The treatment RPC had significantly lower values of K, (0.76 cm h(-1)), D-a and Rp, which is favorable for sustainability of the soil structural system.","Celis-Hidalgo, Jos; Mardones-Flores, Maria; Sandoval-Estrada, Marco; Stolpe-Lau, Neal; Zagal-Venegas, Erick",,42,2008,,,

In this work, we examined the impact of an olive husk compost (OHC) on quality-related physical, chemical and biochemical properties of intensively managed greenhouse soil. To this end, a completely randomized block experiment involving a single factor and two treatments (viz., annual application of OHC at 30Mgha(-1) or no application) with three replications was used for 5years. The effect of the compost was studied at two soil depths (0-10 and 10-25cm) and two positions relative to crop rows (viz., on rows and between rows). Application of OHC increased soil organic matter (SOM) content, which is consistent with the low degradation rate of the compost in soil and confirms its usefulness as a source of organic C for soil. Increased SOM content resulted in decreased bulk density, and also in increased porosity and available water in the soil. The amendment was also an effective source of nutrients, particularly N, P, K and Ca, the last of which contributed to decrease exchangeable Na levels in the soil surface layer. The compost increased the activity of all enzymes studied except urease. This result can be ascribed to increased microbial activity, the presence of enzymes in the compost and their stabilization by organic matter and clay in the soil. Dehydrogenase and phosphatase were the individual enzyme activities in the soil, which were correlated with the largest number of soil properties favourably affected by OHC.

I. Effects on Properties of a Calcareous Sandy Soil,"A long-term experiment (28 years) was conducted to Study the effects of various organic amendments oil physical, chemical, and biological properties of a sandy vineyard soil. Annual applications of either crushed pruned vine-wood (2 t/ha fresh wt), cattle manure (10 and 20 t/ha fresh wt.), or spent mushroom compost (8 and 16 t/ha fresh wt) were compared to all unamended treatment, In plots unamended for 28 years, total organic C (TOC) showed a slow and limited decrease (19%). For the highest rates of exogenous organic amendments, the increase in TOC reached a saturation Value after 20 years and carbon (C) sequestered after 28 years reached 30 Mg/ha. Final predicted TOC obtained by simulation with the AMC model was lower than measured TOC for all treatments. Soil microbial biomass C was very low in unamended plots 24 years after the beginning of the experiment. Fair (and comparable) levels of microbial biomass were observed for moderate amounts (2 t/ha/yr) Of Crushed pruned vine-wood and for single rates of cattle manure and spent mushroom compost, while these levels were high for double doses of organic amendments, As a consequence of TOC increase in topsoil, soil water-holding capacity was improved and bulk density was reduced. Soil P and K concentrations were also increased by exogenous organic amendments. For high rates of organic inputs, mineralized N largely exceeded the vine requirements, with ail important risk of N leaching.

This study investigated effects of land-use changes on several indicators of soil quality (SQ) in this area. We found higher organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (N) contents in virgin soils (under forests and pastures) than in cultivated soils. Distribution of OC throughout the soil profile was influenced by the type and length of tillage operations performed at different sites. Cultivation reduced OC content of the subsoil (0.50-1.00 m) and contributed to a more uniform distribution of organic matter in the plough layer (0-0.50 m) by mixing upper and lower horizon soils and incorporating of organic inputs to a greater depth. In 4 of 5 sites, tilled soils had lower ECe and SAR values than the virgin soils, but when the water table was near the soil surface, the ECe and SAR values were higher in cultivated sites. This suggests that when the water table is deep, the quality of salt-affected virgin soils may be improved by cultivation and leaching of excess salts to deeper layers. In 4 of 5 sites, the virgin soils had slightly greater clay content than the tilled soils, but these soils also had 41-89% less dispersible clay than their cultivated counterparts. The virgin soils had 2-31-fold greater aggregate stability, 4-33% lower bulk density, 6-31% higher water-holding capacity (at 0.3 bar suction), higher cation exchange capacity (CEC), and higher respiration rate than the cultivated soils. The results of this study indicate that frequent tillage and use of summer fallow deteriorates SQ by decreasing SOC and enhancing soil erosion through decreased structural stability and increased mechanically dispersible clay. The results stress the need for farming practices that preserve OC in soils in order to reduce flooding and erosion risks.","Asgari, H.; Golchin, A.",,46,2008,,,

To conserve peatland's function as a biodiversity and carbon reservoir, restoration of an oil palm plantation after burning in tropical peat swamp area was carried out by revegetation using native peat swamp forest plants, together with land rewetting. To monitor the success of the restoration process, soil sampling was carried from that restoration area as well as surrounding natural forest and burned oil palm plantation as comparisons. Analyses of physico-chemical and biological revealed substantial differences after 3.5 years of restoration between the restored soil and both burned oil palm plantation and the natural forest soils. These differences were seen in both physical and chemical characteristics (including water holding capacity (WHC), bulk density (pb), organic matter, and concentration of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate) as well as the activity and diversity of soil microbial community. Increased viable microbial biomass (118% compared with burned oil palm plantation soil) and substrate utilising capacity (31% increase compared with the natural forest soil) as determined by Community Level Physiological Profiling (CLPP) indicated that the restoration of the soil has resulted in significant changes in soil microbial activity. Analysis of all the parameters measured using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed examination of the relationship between the physical-chemical and biological properties of each of the three soils and revealed that, as like other ecosystems, pH and soil phosphatase activity may be useful management parameters in terms of monitoring the restoration progress of tropical peatlands.

The long-term (45 years) effect of applications of manure (FYM) and inorganic (NPK) fertilizers on soil aggregate characteristics and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was studied in surface soil of a Typic Haplustalf sandy loam. Soils from four treatments: inorganic fertilizer in combination with farmyard manure (FYM + NPK), fertilizer only (NPK), farmyard manure only (FYM) and a control receiving neither NPK nor FYM were studied. Results indicate that long-term application of manure with or without NPK improved aggregate stability by increasing mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregate and fraction of dry aggregate > 2.0 mm. Higher values of MWD were also recorded in the water-stable aggregate size distributions for soils amended with either FYM or NPK. Soils amended with FYM + NPK sequestered more SOC than all other treatments. There was a low, but significant positive correlation between MWD of dry aggregates and SOC. Highest values of SOC were recorded in the > 2.0 mm aggregate fractions. This tendency towards greater SOC concentration for > 2.0 mm dry aggregate is suggestive of the effectiveness of this aggregate size range to sequester SOC in savanna Alfisols. These results demonstrate that continuous application of soil amendments like FYM and NPK over a long-term promotes soil aggregate stability and long-term SOC sequestration. Hence, for sustainable production in savanna Alfisols, there is a need to design policies that will promote soil aggregate stability and long-term carbon sequestration under continuous cultivation. Such policies must give attention to soil management practices that maintain higher level of SOC. Here, FYM with or without NPK was essential to increase stability of dry aggregates and SOC sequestration. However, the NPK amended soils possess higher fraction of water-stable aggregates.","Ogunwole, J. O.",,25,2008,,,

Given the aforementioned aspects, soil MB C (C-mic) and MB N (N-mic) of different legume forage crops were investigated in this study. Soil samples were taken in order to identify certain physical and chemical characteristics of the soil using volume cylinders (0 - 6.5 cm depth) from Vicia sativa L.

C-mic and N-mic contents were identified using chloroform - fumigation - extraction method. There was no statistical significance for particle density, bulk density, electrical conductivity, CaCO3 %, and decomposition ratio (C-org/ N-total) of the VSP and MSP soil (P > 0.05). However, some other soil characteristics such as temperature, porosity, sand, silt and clay contents, pH, organic C and total N differed significantly (P < 0.05). Compared to VSP soil, the C-mic contents were determined to be 27 % higher (P < 0.05) in MSP soil. In VSP soil, the soil N-mic content ranged from 83.38 mu g g(-1) to 124.67 mu g g(-1), while it ranged from 91.62 mu g g(-1) to 187.07 mu g g(-1) in MSP soil. The N-mic content of the MSP soil was observed to be approximately 35 % higher than VSP soil, and a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was noticed between the two. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found not only between the C-mic and organic C contents (r = 0.667; P < 0.05) but also between the N-mic and total N contents of MSP and VSP soil (r = 0.881; P < 0.01). The results of the study revealed that soil C-mic and N-mic values differ as the types of planted legume forage crops change.

Four treatments were evaluated (under fig cultivation with the application of 20, 40 and 60 % of biofertilizer through irrigation, a control treatment without biofertilizer and an additional treatment-soil under natural vegetation). Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected in three soil layers (0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 m) with four replicates.

Soil porosity, pore continuity index and blocked porosity were calculated and pore length was estimated. Compared with the native forest, pore network quality is improved, if not maintained, when the soil is cultivated under the conditions described in this experiment. In the conditions of cultivation, the application of bovine biofertilizer, for supplying sediments that block or reduce the size of the pores, did not improve soil air permeability.

Under natural conditions, tepetates are unproductive due to their hardness and low porosity, but they can be used agriculturally after the hardened layer is broken up and fertilizer and organic matter are added Just broken up tepetate consists of angular clods of the original consolidated material of various sizes and they are devoided of aggregate. Because of the scarce presence of organic matter these fragmented tepetates present low availability of N and P, limited water infiltration, and small water holding capacity Additions of manure and cultivation of Leguminosae aim to improve the physical properties of tepetates and particularly to promote the formation of aggregates. Such ameliorated tepetates alleviate the demand for agricultural land. The aim of this study was to evaluate the formation of aggregates from initially broken zip and fragmented tepetates, their dry and wet stability, and the distribution of organic carbon in aggregates and fragments of different sizes in tepetates cultivated between 1 and 100 years. The tepetates were were arbitrarily classified as (I) recently broken up; (II) affected by severe erosion: (III) cultivated mostly under monoculture: (IV) cultivated with Leguminosae for at least 20 years and receiving approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of farm yard manure (FYM) per year; (V) cultivated under no-tillage and few external inputs; (VI) cultivated with cereals and Leguminosae and receiving more than Mg.ha(-1) per year of FYM; (VII) Used as greenhouse bed; (VIII) cultivated with no-tillage and approximately 5 to 10 Mg.ha(-1) of FYM; (IX) used as greenhouse bed and addition of approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of composted wood residues per year In addition to the above mentioned tepetates, two agricultural soils: one managed with traditional tillage (A) and a second with no tillage (IX) were included as checks. We collected 97 samples of tepetates and four soils in the Basin of the Rio Texcoco and neighboring communities. The aggregate stability test overestimated stable aggregates due to the presence of remaining hard fragments of tepetates of different size; the hardness of the latter was one to three times greater than that of the aggregates. The relative amount of stable aggregates increased with the time of cultivation, approaching 80% after 100 years. The recently broken zip tepetates contained only little of C, whereas stable aggregates showed one to three times larger concentration. The accumulation of C with time in tepetate fragments was small, in contrast to the aggregates formed in the same period. The accumulation of organic C was larger in smaller aggregate particles and followed logarithmic or potential models. The results of this study show that ameliorated tepetates have the potential to store carbon. However the accumulated amount of C depend on the aggregate formation, which in turn is related with the agricultural management.

This study was carried out in Madrid, Spain with the aim to establish for the first time the use of Retama sphaerocarpa L. (Boiss) as a dendrochronological tool for dating land abandonment. This offers the possibility to take into consideration a period of time long enough for changes in soil to be determined. Such changes can be indicated by fluctuations in soil organic carbon content (SOC), porosity or water availability. Three different situations resulted from the dendrochronological analysis: soil currently tilled; soil recently abandoned (less than 5 years), and prolonged abandonment (in average 10 years). In addition the influence of Retama sphaerocarpa L. (Boiss) on soils was checked for these periods of abandonment. The rate of SOC gain can be considered fast. Tilled soils accounted for 0.48% SOC, and reached 1% in less than 5 years, although with wide standard deviations. Due to prolonged abandonment SOC reached 1.41%, (P = 0.09). Total soil porosity under tillage was 49%, and decreased to 38% after 4-5 years, but recovered to 41% under prolonged abandonment. Water availability (volumetric soil moisture between field capacity and permanent wilting point) remained the same, ranging from 7.7 to 8.5% along the whole period of time.

The treatments during both rice and wheat crops were (i) farm yard manure @ 20 t ha(-1) (FYM); (ii) nitrogen @ 120 kg ha(-1) (N-120); (iii) nitrogen and phosphorus @ 120 and 30 kg ha(-1)(N120P30) ) and (iv) nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium @ 120, 30 and 30 (N120P30K30) in addition to (iv) control treatment, i.e. without any fertilizer and/or FYM addition. The treatments were replicated four times in randomized block design in a sandy loam (typic Ustipsament, non-saline, slightly alkaline). Bulk density, structural stability of soil aggregates and water holding capacity of 0-60 cm soil layer were measured. The average mean weight diameter (MWD) was highest in FYM-plots both in rice (0.237 mm) and wheat (0.249 mm) closely followed by that in N120P30K30 plots. The effect of FYM in increasing the MWD decreased with soil depth. The addition of both FYM and N120P30K30 increased the organic carbon by 44 and 37%, respectively in rice. The total porosity of soil increased with the application of both FYM and N120P30K30 from that in control plots. In 0-15 cm soil layer, the total porosity increased by 25% with FYM from that in control plots. This difference decreased to 13% in 15-30 cm soil layer. The average water holding capacity (WHC) was 16 and 11% higher with FYM and N120P30K30 application from that in control plots. The MWD, total porosity and WHC improved with the application of balanced application of fertilizers. The grain yield and uptake of N, P and K by both rice and wheat were higher with the application of FYM and inorganic fertilizers than in control plots. The carbon sequestration rate after 32 years was maximum (0.31 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in FYM-plots, followed by 0.26 t ha(-1) year(-1) in N120P30K30-Plots, 0.19 t ha(-1) year(-1) in N120P30 and minimum (0.13 t ha(-1) year) in N-120-Plots.

The objective of this study was to measure a suite of potential SPQ indicators using intact soil cores and grab samples collected from the 0-10 cm depth of a clay loam soil with the treatments: (i) virgin soil (VS): (ii) long-term continuous bluegrass sod (BG); (iii) long-term maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation under no-tillage (NT); (iv) long-term maize-soybean rotation under mouldboard plough tillage (MP); (v) short-term (1-4 years) NT after long-term MP; (vi) short-term MP after long-term BG; (vii) short-term MP after long-term NT. Organic carbon content, dry bulk density, air capacity, relative water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity appeared to be useful SPQ indicators because they were sensitive to land management, and proposed optimum or critical values are available in the literature. Soil macroporosity was also sensitive to land management, but optimum or critical values for this parameter are not yet established. Soil matrix porosity and plant-available water capacity did not respond substantially or consistently to changes in land management, and were thus not useful as SPQ indicators in this study. Converting long-term BG to MP caused overall SPQ to decline to levels similar to lone-term MP within 3-4 years. Converting long-term NT to MP or vice versa caused only minor changes in overall SPQ. With respect to the measured SPQ indicators and their optimum or critical values, both VS and BG produced “good” overall SPQ in the near-surface soil. while long-term maize-soybean rotation under NT and MP produced equally “poor” SPQ.

However, the production model with intensive use of machines for several years causes drastic changes in soil physical quality. This study aimed to investigate the influence of conventional management adoption time in a Yellow Oxissol on soil physical properties. Soil density, particle density, total porosity and soil resistance to penetration were assessed in areas under conventional management, in different usage times, in comparison to a native Savanna, which was used as control. The areas under conventional management contributed to increase the density and reduce the porosity, which was intensified with time of soil use. In the 6 years area, the porosity showed values below 0.50 m(3) m(-3) in the two measured layers. Higher penetration resistance values were observed to areas with higher use of time from 0.15 m depth, reaching values above 3.0 and 2.0 MPa in soils with 6 and 3 years of use, respectively, which is ranked as high. The native vegetation and the newly deforested area have provided less resistance to penetration along the profile, with values falling into low and moderate classes. Different time periods since the implementation of soil management were differentiated by the physical properties of studied soils.","Barbosa, Leovanio Rodrigues; Barros Ibiapina, Thiago Vinicius; Ferreira de Araujo, Ademir Sergio; Pinheiro Leal Nunes, Luis Alfredo; da Silva, Francisco Rafael",,32,2016,,,

The conventional practice of cultivation of RMS is input intensive, deteriorates soil health and is less profitable. Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as dry direct-seeded rice (DSR), zero tillage (ZT) and residue retention may hold potential to increase yields, reduce costs and increase farmers' profits in RMS. Therefore, replicated 5-year field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of six combinations of three tillage and crop establishment (TCE) techniques and two residue management options on soil physical properties, system productivity and economics of an irrigated RMS in north-west India. The TCE techniques consisted of transplanted puddled rice (TPR) followed by conventionally tilled maize (CTM); CTDSR followed by CTM; and ZTDSR followed by ZTM in main plots and two residue management options; removal of residues of both the crops (-R) and partial residue (5 t ha(-1)) either retained at soil surface on ZT plots or incorporated into the soil in CT plots (+R) for both rice and maize in sub-plots. Compared with TPR/CTM-R, soil physical parameters such as water-stable aggregates >0.2 mm were 89% higher, and bulk density, penetrometer resistance and infiltration rate showed significant (P < 0.05) improvement in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) treatment. Similarly, root mass density was 6 to 49% greater in rice and 21 to 53% in maize under ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) plots compared to conventional RMS in different soil layers to 60 cm depth. The total amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in 0-30 cm layer increased by 2.86 Mg ha(-1) in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) over conventional practice. Grain yield of TPR was 5-7% higher compared to CTDSR and ZTDSR, which was attributed to increased number of grains panicle(-1) and grain weight. Maize yield under ZTDSR/ZTM was significantly higher by 4.0% and 14.2% compared to CTDSR/CTM and TPR/CTM, respectively, due to increase in number of cobs plant(-1) and grain number cob(-1). Gradual improvement in soil physical health in ZTDSR/ZTM +R system resulted in higher and stable crop productivity (17.4-17.6 kg m(-3)) with higher profitability in different years over conventional system. Our study demonstrates that CA based management practices can be adopted for RMS on sandy loam or similar soils for sustaining soil and crop productivity in South Asia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Triticale (X Triticosecale), cultivated in a 3-y monoculture, was used as a test plant. Both composts differed in their concentrations of heavy metals. Composts were applied non-recurrently in the spring before sowing, at the rates of 18, 36, and 72 t dry matter ha(-1). The plots without fertilization, and those fertilized annually with mineral nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) were used as controls. Soil samples were collected I month after compost application, as well as each year after harvesting. Application of both composts improved soil physical properties, associated with increasing content of organic carbon (OC). Statistically significant increases of total porosity, field water capacity and amounts of plant-available water were found only in the short time after compost application. Despite the fact that soil OC content decreased with time, a C:N ratio clearly increased in the third year after compost application, which was explained by a depletion of N reserve. Both composts caused a large increase of plant-available P, K, and magnesium (Mg), which was observed during the entire period of the experiment. Beneficial changes were also observed in soil humic substances composition. These were confirmed by increased humic acids content and humic/fulvic acid ratios. Soil cation exchange capacity and base saturation increased in all plots amended with composts. This effect was still observed I year after compost application, while in the third year it remained significant only at the highest compost rates. Compost originating from industrial areas, even if applied in low amounts, caused a significant increase in total concentration of soil heavy metals. This fact did not result, however, in any substantial changes in soil quality with regard to heavy metals content. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

After intercrop sequencing cycles, the essential relevant elements significantly improved growth attributes, physical, chemical and biological attributes of the rhizosphere soil compared to monoculture cropping practice. Maximum moisture content at field capacity (McFc, 24.9%), water holding capacity (WHC, 33.3%) and soil organic carbon (OC, 7.16 g kg(-1)) was recorded in P-U-P intercrop sequencing. This superior sequencing also recorded the available macronutrient contents (N, P, K), exchangeable Ca and Mg of soil which were increased by 8.15%, 36.9%, 8.6%, 31.5% and 22%, respectively over Pmono.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of soil quality attributes was also worked out to evaluate the differences induced among intercrop sequencing systems. The results inferred that PC4 accounted for 100% of the total variance in all intercrop sequencing. Therefore, no correlation was observed between the soil properties, and the first, second and third PC (PC1, PC2, and PC3).

Although crop productivity is sustained mainly through the application of organic manure in the Indian Himalayas, little information is available on C sequestration, C content in different aggregate size fractions and soil water transmission properties (infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity) as affected by long-term manure addition. We analyzed results of an 8-year experiment, initiated in 1995-1996 on a silty clay loam soil, to determine the influence of fertilizer and fertilizer + farmyard manure (FYM) application on those important soil properties. The overall increase in soil organic C (SOC) content in the 0-45 cm soil depth in NPK + FYM treatment as compared to NPK and control treatments was 11.0 and 13.9 Mg C ha(-1) at the end of 8 years, respectively. Application of FYM significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased mean weight diameter (MWD) and SOC contents in different aggregate size fractions. Soil organic C content in macroaggregates was greater than in microaggregates. The response of SOC content to FYM application was dependent upon inorganic fertilization and more upon balanced application of NPK than N only. Steady state infiltration rate under NPK + FYM (1.98 cm h(-1)) was higher than under unfertilized (0.72 cm h(-1)) and NPK (1.2 cm h(-1)). Soil water sorptivity (calculated from Philip's equation) under NPK + FYM (1.06 cm min(-0-5)) was higher than under NPK (0.61 cm min(-0.5)).

Soil samples were collected from major land-cover types in the mountain region: natural forest, grassland and cultivated land (arable). The natural forest served as a control against which to assess changes in soil properties resulting from the removal of natural vegetation or cultivation of soil. Soil samples were collected from 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth six times during the year and examined for their nutrient status, i.e. soil organic matter (SOM); total N (TN); available P (AP); available K (AK); cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH and physical properties like particle size distribution, bulk density (BD), and porosity. Significant differences among land-cover types were found for SOM, TN, AP; AK, CEC and pH. Soil collected from the forest had the highest levels of all nutrients followed by grassland while soil from the arable site had very low nutrient status indicated an extractive effect of cultivation and agricultural practices on soil. With significantly lower clay contents (20%), texturally the soil of arable site was quite different from that of the natural forest and grassland. Similarly, a 13% more BD and 12% lower porosity showed structural deterioration of arable soil. The changes in clay contents, BD and porosity due to cultivation suggest adverse effects on environmental protection functions of soil. The correlation coefficient between OM to TN, AP, AK and CEC suggesting that within a narrow range of soil, OM may serves as a suitable indicator of soil quality. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore, important to sustain high-altitude ecosystems and reinstate the degraded lands in the mountain region.","Abbasi, M.

Intensive tillage has been reported to degrade soil structure and deplete soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks. This study assessed the effect of tillage, crop rotation, and N fertilizer application on soil structure, water-stable aggregation, and aggregate-associated SOC and TSN concentrations and stocks for rotations including burley tobacco. Four burley tobacco production systems (main plots) were established in 2007 on a Bluegrass-Maury (fine, mixed, active, mesic Typic Paleudalf) silt loam soil including: (i) no-tillage continuous tobacco (NT-Tobacco); (ii) conventional tillage continuous tobacco (CT-Tobacco); (iii) 2-yr sod (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) 1-yr no-tillage tobacco (NT-Rotation); (iv) 2-yr sod and 1-yr conventional tillage tobacco (CT-Rotation). In 2012, two N rates (0 and 280 kg N ha(-1)) were applied to split plots. Soil samples were taken in Spring 2013 to determine water-stable aggregate-size distributions and associated SOC and TSN concentrations and stocks. Compared with conventional tillage and tobacco monoculture, notillage and rotation with sod significantly increased macroaggregate fractions (>250 mu m), and associated SOC and TSN stocks at the expense of the silt-clay size class (<53 mu m) and associated SOC and TSN stocks. Although previous fertilizer N application had no significant effect on whole-soil SOC and TSN stocks, a significant interaction with crop rotation on macroaggregate distribution and macroaggregate-associated SOC and TSN stocks was observed. Using NT and/or rotation practices in burley tobacco production maintains desirable soil physical and chemical properties via macroaggregate stabilization, which leads to the conservation of SOC and TSN stocks.","Coyne, Mark S.; Grove, John H.; Pearce, Robert C.; Zou, Congming",,79,2015,,,

In comparatively dry regions, such as large areas of Australia, organic-matter (OM) contents in topsoils of arable land are usually small. Therefore, the effects of wetting and drying are almost solely reliant on the clay content. To investigate the relations between wetting-and-drying cycles, aggregation, clay content, and OM in the Australian environment, an experiment was set up to determine the relative influence of both clay content (23%, 31%, 34%, and 38%) and OM amendments of barley straw (equivalent to 3.1 t ha(-1), 6.2 t ha(-1), and 12.4 t ha(-1)) on the development of water-stable aggregates in agricultural soil. The aggregate stability of each of the sixteen composite soils was determined after one, three, and six wet/dry cycles and subsequent fast and slow prewetting and was then compared to the aggregate stabilities of all other composite soils. While a single wet/dry cycle initiated soil structural evolution in all composite soils, enhancing macroaggregation, the incorporation of barley straw was most effective for the development of water-stable aggregates in those soils with 34% and 38% clay. Repeated wetting-and-drying events revealed that soil aggregation is primarily based on the clay content of the soil, but that large straw additions also tend to enhance soil aggregation. Relative to untreated soil, straw additions equivalent to 3.1 t ha(-1) and 12.4 t ha(-1) increased soil aggregation by about 100% and 250%, respectively, after three wet/dry cycles and fast prewetting, but were of less influence with subsequent wet/dry cycles. Straw additions were even more effective in aggregating soil when combined with slow prewetting; after three wet/dry cycles, the mean weight diameters of aggregates were increased by 70% and 140% with the same OM additions and by 160% and 290% after six wet/dry cycles, compared to samples without organic amendments. We suggest that in arable soils poor in OM and with a field texture grade of clay loam or finer, the addition of straw, which is often available from preceding crops, may be useful for improving aggregation. For a satisfactory degree of aggregate stability and an improved soil structural form, we found that straw additions of at least 6.2 t ha(-1) were required. However, rapid wetting of straw-amended soil will disrupt newly formed aggregates, and straw has only a limited ability to sustain structural improvement.","Cattle, Stephen R.; Scholten, Thomas; Wagner, Stephen",,170,2007,,,

Studies were initiated following observations of both softer soil surface and cracking on plots that had received 15 t/ha of ground agricultural limestone. Liming decreased penetration resistance and increased hydraulic conductivity. These structural improvements were associated with increased mean dry aggregate size, a small increase in wet aggregate stability, higher exchangeable calcium levels, and increased plant growth, but a 9% decrease in total soil organic carbon in the surface 50 mm. This decrease in organic carbon was not associated with deterioration in soil structure, as may have been anticipated. This was probably because total organic C was still 82 g/kg on unlimed plots. Decreases in soil penetration resistance due to liming increased the likelihood of pugging from livestock but may improve ease of tillage. This research demonstrates that liming can improve the structure of a well-aggregated Ferrosol as well as its previously reported effects of increasing soil pH and yields of pasture and barley despite decreasing organic C.","Doyle, R.

Management of soil based ecosystem services need to be considered in agricultural management since intensive management implies not only costs to the farmer but also to society. In this study we used data from four long-term (55 years) agricultural experiments in southern Sweden to assess the effects of two arable farming systems on a range of indicators of soil ecosystem services. One farming system used only annual commodity crops (ACC system) while the other integrated one year of ley (ley system) into the crop rotation. Nitrogen (N) fertiliser was applied annually in both farming systems at two rates (0 and 150 kg N ha(-1)). The ley farming system had an addition of farmyard manure (FYM) once every fourth year. Soil organic carbon, total N, phosphorous, potassium, pH and water holding capacity were used as indicators of regulating services; bacterial and fungal biomass were used as indicators of supporting services; grain yield and protein content were used as indicators of provisioning services. We analysed each of the indicators separately, to identify effects of the farming systems, using linear mixed effects models. In addition, we used principal components analysis to bundle the individual indicators together to create latent variables representing categories of ecosystem services. Yields of wheat were greatest in the plots that received N fertiliser, irrespective of farming system, while mycorrhizal fungal biomass was greatest in the ley system with no inorganic N fertiliser. The rest of the indicators were similar in both farming systems although the lowest values of all ecosystem service indicators were found in the ACC system with no N fertiliser. When bundling the indicators, no trade-offs were found between regulating, supporting and provisioning services. Regulating and supporting services were positively correlated, as were regulating and provisioning services. The ley system with N fertiliser had significantly greater values of regulating and provisioning services relative to the other treatments. The results indicate that different farming systems can have large effects on ecosystem service flows, and that integrating leys into arable rotations can enhance the delivery of soil ecosystem services.

Our objective was to determine how incorporation of three different rates of maize (Zea mays L) straw affected soil aggregate size and stability within the top 30 cm of arid soil on the Loess Plateau of China to provide basic theory of land utilization. Three rates of maize straw (4.5, 9.0, or 13.5 Mg ha(-1), hereafter referred to as LS, MS, and HS) were incorporated with 255 and 90 kg/ha of inorganic N and P fertilizer, respectively, 2 times in a 4-year field experiment. Water stability of five aggregate size classes (>5, 2-5,1-2, 0.5-1, and 0.25-0.5 mm) in the 0-10,10-20, and 20-30 cm depth increments was measured 3 times for each treatment and a check (CK) that received only the inorganic fertilizers. Incorporation of 13.5 Mg ha(-1) of straw significantly increased water stability of three aggregate classes (>5, 1-2, 0.5-1 mm) compared with CK and LS treatments within the surface 10 cm and for aggregates >0.5 mm in the 10-20 cm depth increment. Within the 20-30 cm depth increment water-stablity of aggregates in the 0.25-0.5 mm class increased significantly as the rate of straw incorporation increased. Overall, aggregate stability was primarily increased through changes in microaggregate size distribution, especially for aggregate classes >5, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5 mm within the 0-10,10-20, 20-30 cm soil depth, respectively.

Addition of gypsum improved infiltration rate and bulk density of soil. The greatest percent decreases in pH(s), electrical conductivity (ECe), and sodium absorption rate (SAR) were observed with TW + G @ 100% WGR followed by TW + G @ 100% SGR, TW + G @ 50% SGR, and TW alone. The incorporation of sesbania increased the cation exchange capacity and organic matter, which were greatest with TW + G @ 100% WGR, and the same treatment decreased maximum lime content. The greatest grain and straw yields were recorded with TW + G @ 100% WGR, which significantly differed from other treatments. Maximum net benefit (Rs. ha(-1)) was obtained with TW + G @ 100% WGR and the lowest was obtained with TW.

Our objective was to determine the impact of tillage on soil biological activity and aggregate stability in an Oxisol typical to the region. Three different tillage practices common to the Cerrado region (no-till, disk harrow, and disk plow) and an area under native vegetation were examined. Five different soil enzyme activities, C- and N- mineralization, organic C, total N, and aggregate distribution were determined. Total N, acid phosphatase, arylamidase, and C- and N-mineralization were the most sensitive to changes in tillage management. For each of these analyses, the no-till system had greater concentrations or activities (18-186%) than disk plow in the 0-5 cm layer. Significant differences observed in the 0-5 cm depth did not necessarily translate into total profile differences to a depth of 30 cm. No-till had significantly greater levels of total N, and C- and N-mineralization (20-127%) than the disk harrow system. Total N ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 ka m(-3); C- and N-mineralization (24-day incubation) ranged from 2.8 to 6.8 and 0.04 to 0.10 kg m(-3), respectively, among tillage systems and soil depths. Enzyme activities in all treatments were more strongly correlated with total soil N than with soil organic C (SOC), contrary to the norm in temperate soils where the stronger correlation is with SOC. Mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates was related to SOC (r = 0.73) and total N (r = 0.92), indicating that soil organic matter does play a significant role in stabilizing aggregates in Oxisols. Results indicated the importance of reducing tillage as a means of increasing soil biological activity of the topsoil in the Cerrado region of Brazil. By understanding the effects of tillage on soil biological properties, management systems can be implemented that improve natural nutrient cycling processes and soil structure, resulting in increased agricultural sustainability of tropical ecosystems.

Wet-sieving method was used to determine aggregate size distribution, water-stable aggregates, and mean weight diameter (MWD) as indices of soil aggregate stability. SOC fractions were also determined. The stability of macroaggregates decreased within 5 years of converting open vegetable fields to greenhouses, and a similar trend for MWD was observed. The stability of microaggregates also decreased. LF250 carbon in greenhouse soils was correlated with the amount of 2-0.25 mm size classes (r = 0.984**). As a result, a labile SOC existed in macroaggregates and was susceptible to loss. Positive correlations were also determined between water-stable microaggregates and intra-microaggregate particulate organic matter (r = 0.991**), between water-stable macroaggregates and intra-microaggregate particulate organic matter within macroaggregates (r = 0.998**), and between intra-microaggregate mineral-associated organic matter within macroaggregates (r = 0.971**).

ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL UNDER GRAZING EXCLUSIONS,"Cultivated land has increased in Chile as a result of a process in which native woodland sites were converted to agricultural production. This process had an intermediate step in which sclerophyll species were replaced by Acacia caven, prior to cattle grazing. This land use change presents environmental impacts resulting from carbon losses of ecosystems. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of A. caven on the physical properties of soil. The study was conducted in two sites of central Chile (Pirque and Penuelas). Soil samples were taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm with and without A. caven cover. Organic matter, bulk density, pore size distribution and aggregate stability were evaluated. A marked difference was found in terms of depth in both study sites, also observing a process of densification of the subsurface horizon. A. caven cover has beneficial effects on the soil because it produces increased organic matter, decreased bulk density, and a higher proportion of coarse pores compared to soils without A. caven. However, available water holding capacity was higher in the site that had no influence of A. caven in Pirque. A. caven cover also promotes less mechanical resistance and higher structural stability, so that it is a good alternative to specific site protection towards the restoration of sclerophyll forest.","Becerra, Pablo; Delpiano, Cristian; Leiva, Esteban; Miranda, Alejandro; Montoya, Felipe; Seguel, Oscar; Smith-Ramirez, Cecilia; Soto, Lely; Vasquez, Inao",,31,2015,,,

Structure and composition of the nematode assemblage and soil properties differed between forest and sugarcane soils, even in the same locality. The soil bulk density and the abundance of all nematodes and the diversity of plant-parasitic nematodes were greater whereas soil porosity, soil respiration and abundance of predator nematodes were smaller in sugarcane than in forest areas. We suggest that sugarcane management practices result in changes in the soil properties and concomitantly alter the composition and structure of the nematode assemblages.

It is possible to improve soil aggregation by choosing appropriate agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tillage, crops and fertilizer sources on size distribution of water-stable aggregates (WSA) and nutrient concentrations in aggregate fractions. Soil samples were collected from field sites involving sixteen factorial combinations of tillage [conventional tillage (CT) or no-till (NT)], crop rotations [continuous maize (CC) or soybean/maize (SC)] and fertilizer sources (0, 15, 30 and 45 Mg wet weight ha(-1) of composted cattle manure balanced with inorganic fertilizers). Aggregate fractionation was performed using a wet-sieving method. Four years after the treatments were established, the proportion of large WSA (WSA(> 2mm)) was greater in the NT system, suggesting that NT increased soil aggregation compared to the CT system. There was no difference in soil aggregation between continuous maize and soybean/maize rotations. The application of 30 and 45 Mg ha(-1) year 1 of composted manure produced more WSA(> 2mm) than inorganic fertilizers. The WSA(> 2mm) had a higher total C concentration in CT than NT soils, indicating that WSA(> 2mm) formed in CT systems contained more soil organic matter (SOM) than those in NT systems. However, the difference disappeared when the data were expressed on a sand-free aggregate basis, indicating a dilution effect due to more sand in WSA(> 2mm) from the NT system than the CT system. Total C, N and P concentrations were at least 3 times higher in water-stable microaggregates (WSA(0.25-0.053mm)) than water-stable macroaggregates (WSA(> 0.25mm)). The WSA(0.25-0.053mm) fraction is considered to be a sink for these nutrients, but may also be susceptible to erosion. Transport processes that preferentially remove the WSA(0.25-0.053mm) fraction from agroecosystems could lead to nutrient loading in adjacent ecosystems. It was concluded that adopting no-tillage and applying composted manure increased soil aggregation and nutrient retention in a sandy-loam soil under maize production. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An investigation was conducted to study the effects of long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment started in 1982 in an and region of northwest China. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18% on average, compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment. Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially, resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg(-1), respectively, to 15.46 and 1.28 g kg(-1), on average, and also enhanced available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations by 47, 50, and 68%, respectively, during the 23-year period. Treatment with FYM resulted in a 0.48 mm greater average mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and a higher percentage of macro-aggregates (> 2 mm) and small macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD increased with increasing SOC concentration (R-2=0.75). The SOC concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm). Approximately 54-60% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm) and sand+silt fractions (< 0.05 mm) after treatment without FYM but 57-64% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates (> 0.25 mm) after treatment with FYM. MNPK treatment had the greatest effect on improving the levels of SOC and NPK nutrients and in enhancing the formation and stability of macro-aggregates.","Du, Ming-Wu; Su, Yong-Zhong; Suo, Dong-Rang; Wang, Fang; Zhang, Zhi-Hui",,75,2006,,,

In top soil, the water holding capacity of pasture and forest soils was higher than other soils, especially that under cropping; the sub-soil held more water (12.1 %) than the top soil (10.3 %). The lower moisture level in cultivated or fallow lands could be attributed to the lower soil organic matter.

Relatively higher concentrations of nutrients and lower pH were obtained in the top soil and sub-soil of the forest land. Forest and pasture catchments showed lower Na in soil. Regression analysis showed higher correlation between soil carbon and soil moisture, water holding capacity and nutrients. The nutrients concentrations were higher in forest soil and lowest in the soils of fallow and agricultural lands.

No-tillage with (NTSB) and without stubble burning (NT), reduced chisel-plough tillage (RT) and conventional tillage with mouldboard plough (MT) were compared in rainfed barley monoculture. Bulk density (rho(b)), organic matter content (OM), soil water retention (SWR) at matric potentials of 0 to -1500 kPa, and soil water content (SWC) were determined in the driest year of the 5-year study period. Soil OM in the upper 0.15 m was significantly higher (13%) under NTSB, NT and RT than under MT. Soil rho(b) in the upper 0.15 m under NT and NTSB was greater than under RT and MT, but at a depth of 0.15-0.30 m was greater under RT than under the other treatments.

Available water capacity was greater with NT than with RT and MT. Higher SWC under conservation tillage systems (NT, NTSB and RT) than under MT was attributed mainly to greater AWC and to the mulching effect of crop residues. Crop yield in the driest year of the 5-year period was lowest under MT whereas no differences among treatments were found over the 5-year period. Stubble burning did not affect AWC nor barley yield.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the immediate (one year) impacts of pea (Pisum sativum) and turnip (Brassica rapa rapa) as cover crops on properties of a Kokomo silty clay loam soil (Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls) in Central Ohio under on-farm conditions.

Data indicate that only few soil parameters were significantly affected by the cover crop treatment. For 0-10 cm depth, cover crops significantly decreased pH from 6.7 to 5.7 and increased soil organic C (SOC) concentrations from 23 to 2.5% (g 100 g(-1)). Although cover crops did not have any significant effects on other soil properties, however, there were trends of lower field dry bulk density (BD) and water stable aggregates (WSA) in 0-10 cm depth under the cover cropping system (BD: 13 Mg m(-3), WSA: 72%) than those of control (BD: 1.5 Mg m(-3), WSA: 80% in 0-10 cm), and similar observations were found for deeper soil layers. The lack of significant effects on other soil properties may be due to high field variability and short duration under cover cropping. Similarly, soybean grain yield was not significantly impacted by the treatment but yield was slightly higher under cover crop (4.6 Mg ha(-1)) than under control (4.3 Mg ha(-1)). These data suggest that some improvements in soil characteristics are likely even over a short period under an appropriate cover crop, however, longer-term data are needed to see whether or not these trends are transient.

We compared soil physical properties of long-term conventional (CON) and alternative (ALT) cropping systems near Akron, Colorado (CO); Brookings, South Dakota (SD); Bushland, Texas (TX); Fargo, North Dakota (ND); Mandan (ND); Mead, Nebraska (NE); Sidney, Montana (MT); and Swift Current, Saskatchewan (SK), Canada. Objectives were to quantify the changes in soil physical attributes in cropping systems and assess the potential of individual soil attributes as sensitive indicators of change in SQ. Soil samples were collected three times per year from each treatment at each site for one rotation cycle (4 years at Brookings and Mead). Water infiltration rates were measured. Soil bulk density (BD) and gravimetric water were measured at 0-7.5, 7.5-15, and 15-30 cm depth increments and water-filled pore space ratio (WFPS) was calculated. At six locations, a rotary sieve was used to separate soil (top 5 cm) into six aggregate size groups and calculate mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregates. Under the CON system at Brookings, dry aggregates (> 19 mm) abraded into the smallest size class (< 0.4 mm) on sieving. In contrast, the large aggregates from the ALT system abraded into size classes between 2 and 6mm. Dry aggregate size distribution (DASD) shows promise as an indicator of SQ related to susceptibility of soil to wind erosion. Aggregates from CON were least stable in water. Soil C was greater under ALT than CON for both Brookings and Mead. At other locations, MWD of aggregates under continuous crop or no tillage (ALT systems) was greater than MWD under CON. There was no crop system effect on water infiltration rates for locations having the same tillage within cropping system. Tillage resulted in increased, decreased, or unchanged near-surface BD. Because there was significant temporal variation in water infiltration, MWD, and BD, conclusions based on a single point-in-time observation should be avoided. Elevated WFPS at Fargo, Brookings, and Mead may have resulted in anaerobic soil conditions during a portion of the year. Repeated measurements of WFPS or DASD revealed important temporal characteristics of SQ that could be used to judge soil condition as affected by management.","Baumhardt, RL; Benjamin, JG; Merrill, S; Pikul, JL; Schwartz, RC",,21,2006,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two long term agroforestry systems of cacao management on soil physical and chemical properties in an area originally inhabited by 30 years old native secondary forest (SF). The two agroforestry systems adapted were: improved natural agroforestry system (INAS) where trees without economic value were selectively removed to provide 50% shade and improved traditional agroforestry system (ITAS) where all native trees were cut and burnt in the location. For evaluation of the changes of soil physical and chemical properties with time due to the imposed cacao management systems, plots of 10 cacao genotypes (ICS95, UF613, CCN51, ICT1112, ICT1026, ICT2162, ICT2171, ICT2142, H35, U30) and one plot with a spontaneous hybrid were selected. Soil samples were taken at 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depths before the installation of the management systems (2004), and then followed at two years intervals. Bulk density, porosity, field capacity and wilting point varied significantly during the years of assessment in the different soil depths and under the systems assessed. Soil pH, CEC, exchangeable Mg and sum of the bases were higher in the INAS than the ITAS. In both systems, SOM, Ext. P, K and Fe, exch. K, Mg and Al+H decreased with years of cultivation; these changes were more evident in the 0-20 cm soil depth. Overall improvement of SOM and soil nutrient status was much higher in the ITAS than INAS. The levels of physical and chemical properties of soil under cacao genotypes showed a marked difference in both systems.","Alegre, Julio; Arevalo-Gardini, Enrique; Baligar, Virupax; Canto, Manuel; Julca, Alberto; Loli, Oscar",,10,2015,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of soil tillage on soil physical attributes and organic carbon contents. The experiment was carried out over a period of 17 years in Eldorado do Sul County (RS) in a loamy Acrisol under different management systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage, using vetch-maize in crop succession. An area of native grassland adjacent to the agricultural plots was used as a control. The soil samples were collected in September before sowing the summer crop, from 0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-12.5 and 12.5-17.5 cm deep soil layers. The evaluated soil propeties were organic carbon contents, bulk and particle densities, macro, micro and total porosity, flocculation degree, and aggregate stability. The soil management systems had no effect on soil density and total porosity, but the pore size distribution was dependent on the sampling depth. Soil macroporosity in conventional tillage as compared to reduced tillage and no-tillage was only higher in the layer of 7.5 to 12.5 cm, and micropores were more abundant at a soil depth of 0 to 2.5 cm in no tillage in relation to other tillage systems. The use of no-tillage systems increased aggregate stability in the surface layer (0-2.5 cm) compared to conventional tillage and was related to the increase in soil organic carbon contents.","Albuquerque, JA; Bayer, C; Dalla Rosa, J; Mafra, AL; Mielniczuk, J; da Silva, MAS",,30,2006,,,

This on-farm study assessed the role of primary (sand, silt, and clay) and secondary (micro- and macroaggregates) particle size fractions on the physical protection of SOC to 30-cm depth of nine agricultural and three forest land uses within three contrasting ecoregions of Costa Rica (i.e., Isthmian-Atlantic moist, Pacific dry, and Montane forest). Specific objectives were to: (1) determine the effect of land use in each ecoregion on particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), silt plus clay-associated carbon (S+C-C), and micro- and macroaggregate associated water-stable aggregate carbon (WSA-C), and (2) establish the relationships among aggregate properties and SOC concentration. Aggregate stability was characterized by studying the WSA, mean weight diameter (MWD), and tensile strength (TS). Soils under coffee (Coffea arabica), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and pineapple (Ananas comosus) plantations had high clay contents to 30-cm depth (ranging between 42.9 and 60.7%), which indicated a high potential for SOC storage. In comparison to less disturbed forest soils, micro- and macroaggregation was not strongly affected by agricultural land use. At coffee and pasture land uses, POM-C concentration was significantly lower (ranging between 0.4 and 2.0 g C kg(-1)). Between 58 and 98% of SOC was associated with S+C fractions indicating the importance of these particle size fractions to SOC storage. The S+C-C and micro- and macroaggregate-C concentrations differed mainly among pineapple, mango (Mangifera indica), pasture, and other land uses within ecoregions. Further, there was no general tendency of higher C concentrations in the macro- vs. the microaggregate fractions in contrast to the aggregate hierarchy theory. The MWD was affected by land use only for pineapple and organic farming, and it decreased for mango and coffee with increase in soil depth. Correlations among SOC, texture, and TS were site-specific. Silt content was more important than the other particle size fractions in explaining SOC contents. In summary, the amount of physically separated soil fractions and their C storage and stability to 30-cm depth differed mainly among pineapple, mango, pasture, and coffee in specific ecoregions. Well-designed long-term field experiments in Costa Rica are needed to develop management practices for enhancing SOC storage and stabilization in physically separated soil fractions.","Calhoun, Frank G.; Chacon, Paula; Fausey, Norman R.; Lal, Rattan; Lorenz, Klaus",,65,2015,,,

Continuous stover removal, however, could alter long-term agricultural productivity by affecting soil organic C (SOC) and soil physical properties, indicators of soil fertility and erosion potential. In this study, we showed that 12 consecutive yr of 55% stover removal did not affect mean grain yields at any N fertilizer rate (4.5, 6.3, and 6.0 Mg ha(-1) for 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) in a marginally productive, rainfed continuous corn system under no-till (NT). Although SOC increased in the top 30 cm of all soils since 1998 (0.54-0.79 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), stover removal tended to limit SOC gains compared with no removal. Near-surface soils (0-5-cm depth) were more sensitive to stover removal and showed a 41% decrease in particulate organic matter stocks, smaller mean weight diameter of dry soil aggregates, and lower abundance of water-stable soil aggregates compared with soils with no stover removal. Increasing N fertilizer rate mitigated losses in total water-stable aggregates in near-surface soils related to stover removal. Collectively, however, our results indicated soil structure losses in surface soils due to lower C inputs. Despite no effect on crop yields and overall SOC gains with time using NT management, annually removing stover for 12 yr resulted in a higher risk of wind and water erosion at this NT continuous corn site in the western Corn Belt.","Follett, Ronald F.; Jin, Virginia L.; Mitchell, Robert B.; Schmer, Marty R.; Sindelar, Aaron J.; Stewart, Catherine E.; Varvel, Gary E.; Vogel, Kenneth P.; Wienhold, Brian J.",,79,2015,,,

This study used a 22-year field experiment to determine the effect of crop species on SOC turnover rate in soil aggregates and profiles of a Mollisol. Soils were sampled from 2-m soil profiles in 1991 and 2012, from the plough layer regularly under continuous monocropping of maize, soybean and wheat. Natural C-13 abundance was determined to calculate the fraction of newly derived C in SOC in bulk soil and water-stable aggregates of different sizes. The SOC content in the plough layer tended to decrease under wheat and maize but did not change under soybean from 1991 to 2012. The soil delta C-13 abundance in bulk soil and all aggregate sizes increased in 0-1.8 m depth under maize but decreased in 0-0.8 m under soybean and wheat, with the variations being larger in the larger aggregates. The SOC turnover at 0-0.8 m depth was fastest under wheat, followed by soybean and slowest under maize. The SOC turnover was faster in the larger aggregates for all crops, with the variations among the crop species being larger in > 2 mm aggregates. Crop species affect the delta C-13 abundance and SOC turnover rate consistently in different aggregate sizes in the plough layer and in bulk soil within the rooting zone.","Han, Xiaozeng; Li, Na; Miao, Shujie; Qiao, Yunfa; Xu, Yanli; Zhang, Bin",,392,2015,,,

In this study, surface soils from three prairie restorations of varying ages and plant community compositions were compared with a nearby undisturbed native prairie remnant and a cropped agricultural field in terms of soil physical, chemical and microbial properties. Soil moisture, organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfur, C:N, water-holding capacity and microbial biomass (total PLFA) were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the virgin prairie remnant as well as the two long-term (21 and 24 year) prairie restorations, compared with the agricultural field and the restoration that was begun more recently (7 years prior to sampling). Soil bulk density was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the agricultural and recently restored sites. In most cases, the soil quality indicators and microbial community structures in the restoration sites were intermediate between those of the virgin prairie and the agricultural sites. Levels of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PLFA indicators of nutritional stress were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the agricultural and recent restoration sites than in the long-term restorations or the native prairie. Samples could be assigned to the correct site by discriminant analysis of the PLFA data, with the exception that the two long-term restoration sites overlapped. Redundancy analysis showed that prairie age (p < 0.005) was the most important environmental factor in determining the PLFA microbial community composition, with C:N (p < 0.015) also being significant. These findings demonstrate that prairie restorations can lead to improved quality of surface soils. We predict that the conversion of farmland into prairie will shift the soil quality, microbial community biomass and microbial community composition in the direction of native prairies, but with the restoration methods tested it may take many decades to approach the levels found in a virgin prairie throughout the soil profile.

However, very little information is available on the relatively long-term effect of different crop rotations and soil tillage practices on crop yields and soil quality parameters. This study was conducted at the Normandin Research Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Five rotation types [1: Canola-Barley-Barley-Pea (C-B-B-P); 2: Canola-Pea-Barley-Barley (C-P-B-B); 3: Canola-Barley-Pea-Barley (C-B-P-B); 4: Pea monoculture; and 5: Barley monoculture] and two soil tillage practices [1: Chisel plough (CP) and 2; Moldboard plough (MP)] were evaluated. Canola monoculture of was not included. The study began in 1999 on a former alfalfa field and ended in 2010 after three four-year rotation cycles. Barley monoculture decreased yields by 600 kg ha(-1) in the last five years, whereas field pea monoculture decreased yields by about 1000 kg ha(-1) in most years. Barley monoculture did not significantly reduce grain yields compared to CB-B-P and C-P-B-B, highlighting the importance of alternate crops every year. Soil tillage (CP versus MP) did not significantly affect yields for all crops in most years; and when it did have an effect, it showed inconsistencies by either increasing or decreasing grain yields. Soil tillage also had insignificant impact regardless of the rotation type involved. Rotation type and soil tillage had insignificant effect on soil organic matter content, whereas CP increased nitrate and phosphorus content in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Rotation type had insignificant impact on soil physical properties, whereas CP improved soil water conductivity by 0.03 cm h(-1) for C-B-B-P and barley monoculture. Compared to MP, CP improved soil macro-aggregate (2-6 mm) stability to water as well as aggregate mean weight diameter by about 15% for most of the rotations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our objectives were: i) to quantify the soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen N) storage in silty soils under wheat, maize, grassland and spruce, ii) to determine the SOC and N storage in water-stable aggregates of different size (< 53 mu m, 53-250 pro, 250-1000 mu m, 1000-2000 mu m, > 2000 mu m) and in density fractions (Mineral-associated soil organic matter > 2 g cm(-3) (Mineral-SOM), free particulate organic matter < 1.6 g cm(-3) (free POM), light occluded particulate organic matter < 1.6 g cm(-3) (occluded POM< 1.6) and dense occluded particulate: organic matter 1.6 to 2.0 g cm(-3) (occluded POM1.6-2.0)) and iii) to analyse the stability and turnover of these SOC fractions in the maize soil on the basis of the delta(13)C values. Total SOC stocks down to a depth of 60 cm and including the humus layer were larger at the spruce site (10.3 kg C m(-2)) as compared with the grassland, wheat and maize (7 to 8 C kg m(-2)). However, SOC stocks in the mineral soil were smaller in the forest soil than in the agricultural soils. In the arable soils, the aggregate fractions 53-250 pm and 250-1000 pm were the most abundant size fractions, whereas aggregates > 1000 mu m were most abundant in the grassland and forest soil. The SOC concentration and the C/N ratio were greater for macroaggregates (> 250 pm) than microaggregates (< 250 mu m) in the field and grassland soils. At the maize site the percentage of maize-derived C was smallest in the fraction < 53 mu m with 24% and steadily increased with increasing aggregate size to 47% in the fraction > 1000 pm. The major part (86-91%) of the SOC was associated with the heavy mineral fraction at the grassland, maize and wheat site. In the A horizon of the spruce stand, the particulate organic matter accounted for 52% of the total SOC content. The C/N ratios of density fractions decreased in the order free POM< 1.6> occluded POM > Mineral-SOM for all soils and depths. The mean age of organic carbon in the water-stable aggregates in the Ap horizon of the maize site increased with decreasing aggregate size from 35 yr (> 1000 mu m) to 86 yr (< 53 mu m). For the density fractions the order was free POM (22 yr)< dense occluded POM1.6-2.0(49 yr)< Mineral-SOM (63 yr)< light occluded POW< 1.6 (83 yr). The results showed that the type of land use affected the distribution pattern of litter carbon to functionally different SOM pools and that increasing SOC concentrations were closely associated with the formation of macroaggregates.

This study investigated the effects of changes in land-use type on some soil properties in a Mediterranean plateau. Three adjacent land-use types included the cultivated lands, which have been converted from pastures for 12 years, fragmented forests, and unaltered pastures lands. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from four sites at each of the three different land-use types from depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm in Typic Haploxeroll soils with an elevation of about 1400 m. When the pasture was converted into cultivation, soil organic matter (SOM) pool of cultivated lands for a depth of 0-20 cm were significantly reduced by, on average 49% relative to SOM content of the pasture lands. There was no significant difference in SOM between the depths in each land-use type, and SOM values of the forest and pasture lands were almost similar. There was also a significant change in soil bulk density (BD) among cultivation (1.33 Mg m(-3)), pasture (1.19 Mg m(-3)), and forest (1.25 Mg m(-3)) soils at depth of 0-20 cm. Only for the pasture, BD of the depth of 0-10 cm was significantly different from that of 10-20 cm. Depending upon the increases in BD and disruption of pores by cultivation, total porosity decreased accordingly. Cultivation of the unaltered pasture obviously increased the soil erodibility measured by USLE-K factor for each soil depth, and USLE-K factor was approximately two times greater in the cultivated land than in the pasture indicating the vulnerability of the cultivated land to water erosion. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and water-stable aggregation (WSA) were greater in the pasture and forest soils compared to the cultivated soils, and didn't change with the depth for each land-use type. Aggregates of >4.0 mm size were dominant in the pasture and forest soils, whereas the cultivated soils comprised aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. I found that samples collected from cultivated land gave the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity values regardless of soil depths, whereas the highest values were measured on samples from forest soils. In conclusion, the results showed that the cultivation of the pastures degraded the soil physical properties, leaving soils more susceptible to the erosion. This suggests that land disturbances should be strictly avoided in the pastures with the limited soil depth in the southern Mediterranean highlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this case study, we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after 2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible, however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within even a year of reclamation.

Soil samples were collected at the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30-cm depths in the region of Campos das Vertentes, at the Alto do Rio Grande, MG.

The following management systems were evaluated: conventional tillage with potato (CTP); conventional tillage with potato, followed by oat in rotation with corn (CTPOC); conventional tillage with corn (CTC); no-till with corn (NTC); eucalyptus forest (EF); and native vegetation (NV). The bulk density increased in the systems CTPOC and NTC, compared to the native vegetation. The total volume of pores was reduced in the systems CTP, CTPOC, and NTC, even within the short growing time of the systems CTP and CTPOC. The conventional systems CTP, CTPOC and CTC did not change the soil aggregate stabilty enough to differ of the native vegetation. The systems with less canopy removal are establishing a new equilibrium condition. The slighter soil tillage, the higher organic matter content, and the grass root aggregating action in the systems NTC and EF were benefic for the soil quality.

There were no significant differences in permeability of soil to water among the management systems (CTP, CTPOC, CTC and NTC), with the values ranging from 35,4 to 54,6 mmh(-1) being classified as slow to moderate; these values were rather inferior than the equilibrium system (NV).","Ferreira, Mozart Martins; Naves Silva, Marx Leandro; da Silva, Rubens Ribeiro",,29,2005,,,

(HH), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) (TO) and tea (Camellia Sinensis (L.)) (TE) wastes based on hydraulic property improvement of a loamy sand cropland in Turkey. The effects of agricultural wastes on field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), available water content (AWC), relative saturation (RS) and initial infiltration rate (IR) were determined for a loamy sand soil 7 months after agricultural wastes were incorporated to 15cm soil depth at four different rates (0, 2%, 4% and 6%, weight:weight) in a randomized plot design experiment with three replicates. While increases in soil OM content for the M application rates were generally lower, TE and HH treatments including high organic carbon (OC) contents resulted in high soil organic matter (OM) increases. Organic wastes generally increased the values of soil hydraulic properties, with increased aggregate stability (AS) and total porosity (F) and reduced bulk density (BD). The highest AS and F values were obtained with 6% HH and 6% TE applications, respectively. Due to different mineralization rates of the organic wastes attributable to their carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratios, the same application rate had different effects on the soil's hydraulic properties. Manure, having the lowest C:N ratio, generally had a lower effect on AS and BD. Increased IR due to increases in AS and F by the agricultural waste treatment, especially at 4 and 6% HH, reduced the AW content to 15cm compared with 2% HH. This indicates that the significant application of higher C:N ratio wastes is not suitable in terms of AW, due to significant improvement of IR. While the highest FC (17.3%) and AWC (10.7%) values were found in the 6% TE application, the highest PWP (7.2%) and IR (333.4cmh(-1)) were in the 6% TO and 6% HH applications, respectively. To improve soil physical and hydraulic properties, 6% TO and M, 4% TE and 2% HH applications are suggested for loamy sand cropland.","Candemir, Feride; Gulser, Coskun",,61,2015,,,

The objective of this work is to study modifications in the physical properties of soils in the Rio Verde watershed, as a function of the land use time for agriculture, determined from classification of Landsat satellite images between 1980 and 2010. Soil samples were collected at surface (0-20cm) and subsurface (20-40cm) horizons for the different classes of land use time (<10, 10-20, 20-30, and >30years). The following physical properties were measured: bulk density (BD), air permeability (K-a), penetration resistance (PR), microporosity (MI), macroporosity (MA), and total porosity (TP). Results showed a strong expansion with time of agriculture that occupied 353% (1980), 374% (1990), 513% (2000), and 609% (2010) of the watershed area. When properties were compared with those from the reference areas (preserved soils under native vegetation), significant differences were observed for all the physical attributes of soils for a land use time higher than 20years. Overall, BD and PR increased with land use time, and the opposite was verified for K-a, MA, and TP. Some physical properties presented values (e.g., 154gcm(-3) for BD and 0.06cm(3)cm(-3) for MA) close to the critical ones reported to affect crop development, but they were not still impacting on local soybean yield.

Three tillage systems were selected: no-tillage with. straw cover plus recommended urea nitrogen rate (NTS), no-tillage with straw removed and manure applied plus recommended urea nitrogen rate (NTM), and conventional tillage with straw removed plus conventional urea nitrogen application rate (CT). There were three replicates of each treatment organized in a randomized block design. NTS and NTM treatments were found to result in a slightly decrease in the soil bulk density (BD), and significantly increased the proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA) (>2 mm), as well as the water infiltration capacity. The proportion of water stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm), the mean weight diameter (MWD) and the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates in the 0-20 cm layer were unchanged by NTS and NTM. The total soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at a depth of 0-60 cm was not significantly different among the treatments. Both aggregate-associated SOC concentration and stocks (0-5 cm) were significantly greater for NTS and NTM compared with CT, while CT led to a greater OC accumulation in the 20-60 cm soil layer compared with NTS and in the 10-20 cm compared with NTM. The mesoaggregate fraction (2-0.25 mm) and its associated OC pool accounted for the highest percentages in the whole soil profile under the CT treatment The NT system was found to have a positive effect on the investigated soil physical properties and increase soil carbon content in the soil surface layer. The CT system in conjunction with the wheat-maize double cropping system, however, improved soil aggregation in the soil profile (0-60 cm) and also maintained a higher fraction of SOC in the subsoil compared with the NT systems.

Soil samples were obtained from two long-term experiments that were designed to study the impact of tillage systems on crop yields. However, the objectives of this experiment were to assess the impact of NT on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate and other soil properties and to estimate historic depletion of SOC under different soil management practices with reference to the undisturbed wooded control. The two long-term experiments in Ohio studied were those sited at South Charleston and Hoytville. The South Charleston, (83 degrees 30' W and 39 degrees 48' N) experiment was established in 1962 on Crosby silt loam (fine mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf). The site has long-term annual temperature and precipitation of 10.8 degrees C and 1043 mm, respectively. Tillage treatments for continuous corn (Zea mays) were NT, chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow (MP). The Hoytville (84 degrees 04' W and 41 degrees 03' N) experiment was established in 1987 on Hoytville clay loam (fine, illitic mesic Mollic Epiaqualfs) soil. The site has long-term annual temperature and precipitation of 9.9 degrees C and 845 rum, respectively. There were two crop rotations: (i) 2-year corn-soybean (Glycine max) rotation with NT and subsoiling and (ii) 3-year com-soybean-oat (Avena sativa) rotation with NT, CP, and rotational tillage soil management. The Hoytville clay site is poorly drained, has higher clay content, and higher and more even by distributed antecedent level of SOC in the soil profile than does the South Charleston silt loam soil. No-till increased SOC and N pools in the 0 to 5-cm layer in silt loam soil but had no effect in clay soil. The rate of SOC sequestration in the silt-loam soil under NT was 175 kg C ha(-1) y(-1). The silt loam soil had higher SOC and N stratification ratios in NT than in MP and CP treatments, whereas the stratification ratios were low and similar in all treatments in the clayey soil. For both soils, there were no differences between tillage treatments in several soil properties including texture, available water capacity, hydraulic conductivity (K), and cation exchange capacity. The NT decreased soil bulk density and pH in the 0 to 15-cm layer in the silt loam soil. The plow till treatments had a small impact on soil aggregation in clayey soil. The decline in water-stable aggregates with reference to NT was no more than one sixth. In the silt loam soil, however, the water-stable aggregates in plow till treatments were merely one third of that in the NT treatment. The historic loss of the SOC pool for 0 to 30-cm depth under agricultural land use was 25 to 35% in silt loam and 19 to 25% in the clayey soil.","Jarecki, MK; Lal, R",,170,2005,,,

Alternatives to mitigate this problem are necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of seeder equipped with fixed shanks openers, working at three depths, in a Ferralic Nitisol (Rhodic), under NT on the mitigation of soil compaction and corn (Zea mays L.) plant development. The test comprised three treatments regarding the depth at which the shank openers of a seeder used to sow corn worked: openers reaching up to 0.05 m; openers reaching up to 0.07 m; and openers reaching up to 0.17 m. The effect of these treatments was evaluated in relation to the determination of soil physical parameters, and corn plant parameters. The use of a seeder equipped with fixed shanks openers up to 0.17 m depth caused an increase in soil macroporosity and total porosity, and a decrease in soil bulk density, soil resistance to penetration and degree of compactness in the layer between 0.07 and 0.17 m. The improved physical conditions of the soil in this layer led to a further development of the root system of plants in greater depth, and consequently to a better development of corn plants with higher stalk diameter, root density and root length. The use of a seeder equipped with fixed shanks openers working up to 0.17 m depth, therefore, promoted physical improvement to the soil, favoring the development of corn plants, and presenting potential to mitigate the compaction of clayey soils under NT.

The aim of this study was to investigate if NT has similar impacts on the stability of water-stable aggregates and C and N stabilization in two Oxisols (Typic Haplorthox) under different crop rotations. Slaking-resistant aggregates were isolated by wet sieving and analyzed for C and N concentrations at two agricultural experiment sites (Passo Fundo and Londrina) in southern Brazil. At both sites, the total organic C and N in the 0- to 5-cm depth interval, decreased in order native vegetation (NV) > NT > conventional tillage (CT). The mean weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates was on average 0.5 mm greater under NT compared with CT, and was also greater (approximately 0.2 mm) under more diverse rotations, which included a leguminous green-manure crop, in comparison with continuous wheat (Triticam aestivum)-soybean (Glycine Max L.). The aggregate-size distribution was dominated (60-90%) by macroaggregates (> 250 mu m). At both sites, CT decreased the proportion of the largest macroaggregate class (> 2000 mu m) by approximately 10% in comparison with NT management, and there was a corresponding increase in the proportion of the 53- to 250-mu m aggregate class. In the 0- to 5-cm soil layer of both sites, the C and N concentrations were significantly higher in the macroaggregates of the NT than of the CT systems. The lack of differences in C, N content, and ON ratio across aggregate-size classes indicated that these soils dominated by 1:1 clays and Fe/Al oxides do not express an aggregate hierarchy and that an increase in aggregation does not explain the increase in C and N under NT. In conclusion, CT decreased aggregation similarly in Oxisols as in temperate soils, but this decrease does not explain the loss of C and N because the tight feedback between soil organic matter (SOM) and aggregate stability (i.e., SOM being a major binding agent) observed for temperate soils was not found for Oxisols.","Alves, BJR; Boddey, RM; Paustian, K; Six, J; Torres, E; Urquiaga, S; Zotarelli, L; dos Santos, HP",,69,2005,,,

Therefore it is important to find a soil-surface management practice that protects the soil against water erosion. We assessed the potential of mulches or grass covers to stabilize soil aggregates in a calcareous sandy loam from a vineyard in Champagne after 9 years under different management systems. Four different treatments were studied: (i) a bluegrass (Poa pratensis) surface cover between the vine rows (GC) with bare soil under the vines (R); two organic mulches of (ii) coniferous (CB) or (iii) poplar (PB) bark that covered the entire soil surface, and (iv) bare soil between the rows as a control. The bark amendments were applied every 3 years at rates of 61 and 67 t ha(-1) for the PB and CB treatments, respectively. The kinetics of soil disaggregation in water fitted a power law (A=K t(-D)), in which K was the fraction of water-stable >200 mum aggregates remaining after 1 hour of wet-sieving. In the 0-5 cm layer, aggregate stability was greater for GC (K=21.7), CB (K=15.2) and PB (K=13.6) than for the control (K=10.5) and R (K=11.8). In the 0-20 cm layer, CB also stabilized soil aggregates (K=14.0-15.0); but PB did not. Structural stability was more strongly related to total organic carbon (R-2=0.64, P <0.001) than to microbial biomass carbon (R-2=0.54, P<0.001). A bluegrass cover enhanced structural stability in the 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm layers (K=14.2), probably because of intense root development and rhizodeposition enhancing microbially produced metabolites, such as carbohydrates. Establishing grass cover or applying bark mulch are effective agricultural practices that improve soil aggregate stability and thus should reduce soil erosion. The vegetative growth of the vines was greater on the soils amended with bark mulches and less on the grass covered soils compared with the control soil; however, no difference in wine quality was observed among the different treatments.","Andreux, F; Bartoli, F; Chaussod, R; Doledec, AF; Dousset, S; Goulet, E",,20,2004,,,

In this study, agricultural land from Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve in Indonesia was evaluated to assess the impact of oil palm (burning and without burning) and rubber (5-10 and >40 years old) plantations on soil properties through comparisons with soils from a natural forest (NF). Substantial changes in the physico-chemical properties of soils from both plantations were observed including significant reductions in soil organic matter (4-18%) and water holding capacity (22-53%), but an increase in bulk density (rho b) (0.08-0.17 g cm(-3)). A significant increase in bacterial biomass was also observed following conversion of the NF to plantation (p<0.05). However, the oil palm plantation (OPP) (without burning) showed reduced microbial activities and the lowest Shannon diversity values (2.90) compared to other samples. Community-level physiological profiling showed impaired community function only in soils from the OPP but higher CO2 exchange rates in most plantation soils. Soils from the rubber plantation (RP) were less impaired in terms of their natural function and therefore RPs appeared to be more suitable for sustainable agricultural use than OPP.","Adetutu, Eric M.; Ball, Andrew S.; Kadali, Krishna K.; Mansur, Abdulatif A.; Nurulita, Yuana; Zul, Delita",,13,2015,,,

Here we show that these farms accumulated C at 8.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), increasing cation exchange and water holding capacity by 95% and 34%, respectively. Thus, within a decade of management-intensive grazing practices soil C levels returned to those of native forest soils, and likely decreased fertilizer and irrigation demands.

The link between cropping intensity, defined by pesticide and fertiliser applications, and soil biophysical status was examined at 70 sites in a high-yielding region of the UK, in which cropping sequences covering a wide range of intensity had diverged from a common low-intensity origin in the 1970s. Two sequences of still low or moderate intensity based on spring cereals or a low frequency of winter cereals formed comparators for three high intensity sequences based on winter wheat and potato which together were associated with adverse effects of -30% on soil carbon content in the upper soil layer (P < 0.001), -11% on soil water holding capacity (P < 0.01) and +15% on soil bulk density (P <0.001). Negative effects were also found in some high intensity sequences on soil macroporosity and penetrometer resistance. Even in this high-yielding region, therefore, current forms of intensification are associated with adverse trends in soil condition that may be detrimental to future production. The effects of these trends in soil condition on agricultural output now need to be quantified, and the economic burden accounted for, if fields reduce their capacity to yield or need reparation to keep them productive.

The methods for indexation of quality indicators called the Integrated Quality Index (IQI) and the Nemoro Quality Index (NQI) were used in this study to evaluate soil quality in experimental plots planted to eucalyptus. The selection of these indicators was made based on nine soil quality indicators: geometric mean diameter, water permeability, organic matter, macro- and microporosity, total porosity, bulk density, penetration resistance, and flocculation index, which are related to water erosion. Treatments consisted of eucalyptus planted on level land, with and without maintenance of residues on the soil surface, planted on a downslope, and planted on bare soil in two distinct biomes, whose native vegetation are Cerrado (Brazilian tropical savanna) and Forest. The soil quality indices (SQI) were highly correlated with erosion. Among the management systems, Eucalyptus with maintenance of the residues had higher values in both indices, highlighting the importance of plant cover and organic matter for soil and water conservation in forest systems. The SQI had a high inverse correlation coefficient with soil and water losses. Places with the highest rates of water erosion also had the lowest IQI and NQI values. Thus, the indices tested allowed efficient evaluation of the effects of the management practices adopted on soil quality in relation to water erosion.","Candido, Bernardo Moreira; Curi, Nilton; Ferreira, Mozart Martins; Franca de Freitas, Diego Antonio; Mincato, Ronaldo Luiz; Naves Silva, Marx Leandro",,39,2015,,,

The soil physical indicators, bulk density, soil penetration resistance, macroporosity, and total porosity proved to be sensitive to changes in the soil caused by agricultural use compared to native forest. In contrast, physical-mechanical properties are not recommended for SQ assessments. Organic matter is the indicator most responsive to SQ degradation; however, the effects from soil tillage are not manifested in three years of study.

The four rice crop establishment techniques i.e., direct seeding in zero tilled soil (P-1), wet seeding of sprouted rice seed with drum seeder in puddled condition (P-2), manual transplanting in puddled soil (P-3) and mechanical transplanting in puddled soil (P-4) served as horizontal treatments while four tillage practices in wheat (i.e. T-1- rotavator till drill, T-2- conventional sowing, T-3- strip till drilling, T-4- Zero till drilling) served as vertical treatments in strip plot design with three replications. Total water stable aggregates (WSA)(>0.053 mm) in the soil at surface 0-15 cm depth, ranged between 69.92 and 88.78 % in rice crop, while in winter crop it varied between 74.62 and 83.57 %. According to mean weight diameter (MWD) different treatments in regard to crop establishment technique of rice could be ranked in the order P-1 > P-4> P-2 > P-3 and T-4 > T-3 > T-1 > T-2 in wheat strip regarding tillage practices. However, the MWD decreased drastically in lower soil depth. The SOC ranged from 4.06 to 5.67 g kg(-1) in soil samples from rice plots and from 4.32 to 5.24 g kg(-1) in different tillage treatments in wheat at surface 0-15 cm layer. SOC contents in direct seeding in zero tilled rice strip (5.67 g kg(-1)) and zero till drill in wheat strip (5.24 g kg(-1)) were significantly higher than other treatments in all soil depth. The MBC of direct drilling zero tilled (441 mu g g(-1)) in rice strip and zero till drill in wheat strip (395 mu g g(-1)) had the highest values while the manually transplanted-puddled (383 mu g g(-1)) rice and conventional wheat sowing had the lowest values (334 mu g g(-1)) at all the depths. The differences were significant in at P<0.01 for both SOC and MBC and ranked in order of P-1 > P-2 > P-4 > P-3 of rice crop strip and T-4 > T-3 > T-1 > T-2 in wheat crop strip under 0-15 cm soil depth. The decrease in SOC an average all treatments was about 51 and 89 percent from layer 0-15 to 15-30 and 30-45 cm, respectively. The interaction effects of P at same level of T and T at same level of P treatments on MWD, SOC and MBC were significant (P < 0.01) in 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depth.","Chaudhary, V.

The objective of this project was to develop a technique for identifying SQIs for agricultural land use. Soil structure, water retention and transmission properties, and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured and related to agronomic productivity for five land use and soil management treatments at the experimental farm of the North Appalachian Experimental Watersheds, Coshocton, Ohio. The five treatments were no-till corn without manure (NTWM), no-till corn with manure (NTM), no-till corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max) rotation (NTCSR), conventional tillage corn (CT), and meadow (M). Soil properties measured were bulk density (rho(b)), drainable porosity (f(a)), available water capacity (AWC), steady state infiltration rate (i(c)), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, water stable aggregation (WSA), mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), and texture. The correlation analysis on the measured soil attributes reduced the number of key variables from 17 to 11. A rating index on a 1 to 5 scale was obtained for each of the key soil properties. The linear regression analysis was first performed with key soil attributes as independent variables and biomass or grain yields as dependent variables, with the rating factor later assigned to each measured key soil attribute. The multiple regression analysis showed that SOC and WSA explained more than 35% of variability in biomass and 33% in grain yields, respectively, and were identified as the major SQIs. Other important SQIs were rho(b), AWC, MWD, pH, and EC. The cumulative sustainability ratings (CR) for each land use showed that NTM was the most sustainable soil management treatment (CR = 20) and CT the least sustainable (CR = 30). The CR was also correlated significantly with grain yield (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.002). The CR for different land uses suggests that soil management with NTM is the most sustainable and CT the least.","Ebinger, M; Lal, R; Skukla, MK",,169,2004,,,

The aim of this study was to assess possible changes in physical properties of soil resulting from the management system and PS application. Five areas were sampled: native forest, pasture with mineral fertilizer and PS application, conventional tillage with mineral fertilizer and PS application, no-tillage with mineral fertilizer, no-tillage with mineral fertilizer and PS application. The evaluated physical properties of soil were: bulk density (Bd), total porosity (Pt), macroporosity (Ma), macro and microporosity ratio (Ma/Mi) and penetration resistance (PR). The adoption of different agricultural management systems altered the physical conditions of the soil, increasing the Bd and the PR and reducing the pore volume. The soil managed under pasture showed the highest values of PR. No changes were found in physical properties of soil by the application of PS in evaluated tillage systems.","Jan Verburg, Ernst E.; Oliveira, Dener M. S.; de Lima, Renato P.",,19,2015,,,

Most Ethiopian soils are already exhausted by several decades of over exploitation and mismanagement. Since many agricultural sustainability issues are related to soil quality, its assessment is very important. We determined integrated soil quality indices (SQI) within the surface 0-15 cm depth increment for three agricultural land uses: rain fed cultivation (RF); agroforestry (AF) and irrigated crop production (IR). Each land use was replicated five times within a semi-arid watershed in eastern Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Using the framework suggested by Karlen and Stott (1994); four soil functions regarding soil's ability to: (1) accommodate water entry (WE); (2) facilitate water movement and availability (WMA); (3) resist degradation (RD); and (4) supply nutrients for plant growth (PNS) were estimated for each land use. The result revealed that AF affected all soil quality functions positively more than the other land uses. Furthermore, the four soil quality functions were integrated into an overall SQI; and the values for the three land uses were in the order: 0.58 (AF) > 0.51 (IR) > 0.47 (RF). The dominant soil properties influencing the integrated SQI values were soil organic carbon (26.4%); water stable aggregation (20.0%); total porosity (16.0%); total nitrogen (11.2%); microbial biomass carbon (6.4%); and cation exchange capacity (6.4%). Collectively, those six indicators accounted for more than 80% of the overall SQI values.","Gelaw, Aweke M.; Lal, R.; Singh, B. R.",,7,2015,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biosolids addition on physical attributes of an Oxisol medium texture (LVd) and an Oxisol clayey (LVef). Accumulated doses of biosolids of 0.0, 25.0, 47.5, 50.0 Ma ha(-1) were incorporated at 0.1 in depth. Deformed samples were collected in the fifth year after maize harvest, at the depths of 0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 m for the determination of granulometric composition and organic matter. Undeformed samples were collected with metallic cylinders of 0.03 m of height and 0.048 m diameter were taken for determination of bulk density, porosity and water retention in soil. The macroporosity increased at 47.5 Mg ha(-1) and 50.0 Mg ha(-1) of biosolids, in LVd and LVef, respectively, and the soil bulk density decreased at 50.0 Mg ha(-1) in LVd, at the depth of 0.0-0.1 m. The application of 50.0 Mg ha(-1) biosolids did not modify total porosity, microporosity and water retention in all tensions, in both soils.

This model has however been questioned for highly weathered Oxisols where inconclusive results regarding the presence of aggregate hierarchy have been obtained to date. We hypothesized that in Oxisols (i) an aggregate hierarchy would be present (ii) the porosity of micro-aggregates would be lower than that of macro-aggregates and (iii) pore geometry of aggregates would influence SOC mineralization. We collected topsoils from Oxisols in northern New South Wales, Australia from which macro-aggregates (>250 mu m), micro-aggregates (53-250 mu m) and <53 mu m fractions were isolated from bulk soil by wet sieving. 3D images of macro- and micro-aggregates were produced using X-ray computed tomography (mu CT) showing the presence of micro-aggregates inside macro-aggregates, which confirmed the presence of an aggregate hierarchy in the Oxisols studied. Macro-aggregates were more common and SOC in higher concentrations in forest systems compared with agricultural (the cultivation or pasture) land-uses, but aggregate geometry differed little between the land-uses studied. The porosity of macroaggregates (4%) was significantly lower than micro-aggregates (5.5%). Despite the differences in pore geometry between macro- and micro-aggregates, SOC mineralized (SOCmin) during a 2-month incubation (at 25 degrees C) was similar in macro- (3% of SOC concentration) and micro-aggregates (2.8% of SOC concentration). We conclude that although aggregate hierarchy exists in these soils and that aggregate geometry did differ between aggregate size classes, there was no evidence to support the porosity exclusion principle and the assumption that SOC is preferentially stabilized within microaggregates in these soils.

To assess the potential of such former agricultural soils for production of tree crops, information on soil properties is needed. The water-retention characteristics (WRC), bulk density (1313), organic matter (OM) concentration and particle-size distribution were studied in soil on afforested agricultural land in western Finland. Sites with an OM < 40% in the 0-20 cm soil layer were sampled. Undisturbed core samples were taken from the 5-10, 15-20, 25-30 and 35-40 cm soil depths at 38 profiles on 23 sites. The results suggested that the properties of former agricultural soils differ considerably from the pristine mineral forest soils. The sites studied were characterised by high OM, fine texture, gleyic properties in the soil profile and low air-filled porosity (AFP) at field capacity (-10 kPa matric potential), resulting from the predomination of small pores. AFP was, in general, less than 20% in the topmost soil layer and decreased markedly with increasing soil depth indicating deteriorating aeration. In mineral soils (OM < 15% in the 0-20 cm soil depth) with a median particle size of <0.02 mm (clayey and silty soils) AFP was significantly lower than in the coarser-textured soils. In mull soils (OM 15-40% in the 0-20 cm soil depth), texture did not affect AFP. Prediction of AFP from OM was not successful because OM controlled both the upper and lower limits of AFP to a similar degree. The results indicate that high water-table level associated with the predomination of fine pores in the soil leads to potential risk of restricted aeration and reduced forest growth.

The interactive effects of tillage (no-till and conventional tillage), crop rotations (continuous corn, corn-soybean rotation) and composted cattle manure applications [0, 15, 30, and 45 Mg (wet weight) ha(-1)] on WSA were assessed in a factorial (tillage X crop rotation) split plot (compost) experiment. The proportion of WSA >4 mm was greater in compost-amended than unamended soils within 1 yr, and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates increased with increasing compost application rates. By the second year of the study, no-till soils under continuous corn and the soybean phase of the corn-soybean rotation had more WSA >4 mm and a greater MWD than any crop rotation in conventionally tilled soils. Increasing the C input to soil increased the MWD of aggregates. The MWD of aggregates was related to the C content of soils under no-till, but not conventional tillage, suggesting more physical stabilization of organic matter (OM) in no-till than conventional tillage agroecosystems. Our findings indicate rapid improvements in aggregation of a silt-loam in the first 2 yr after compost application and the adoption of no-tillage practices.","Hu, QC; Liu, AG; Whalen, JK",,67,2003,,,

Merr.] -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system. The results pertaining to the experiments at the end of the two year study revealed that most of the soil properties except infiltration rate and microbial biomass carbon (MBC); and root parameters of both crops except root length density (RLD) and average root diameter of wheat were non-significant by the sequential tillage and crop establishment treatments. Unlike sequential tillage and crop establishment techniques, all soil properties except bulk density, pH, EC and root parameters of both soybean and wheat responded significantly to the residue management practices. The infiltration rate was significantly higher with skipping the sequence of CT-Flat by ZT-Flat. Skipping the sequence of CT-Flat and bed with ZT-Flat and bed recorded higher soil mean weight diameter (MWD) and grand mean diameter (GMD) at 010 cm soil depth than the counterpart by skipping of ZT-Flat and bed with CT-Flat and bed. The percentage of soil macro-aggregate was high by skipping ZT-Flat and bed with CT-flat and bed at all depths while the reverse was exhibited in case of percentage soil micro-aggregates by skipping CT-Flat and bed with ZT-Flat and bed. By skipping CT-flat and bed with ZT-flat and bed significantly higher soil MBC was recorded than the counterpart skipping tillage treatments. The same significant trend was also exhibited for soil MBC with residue management treatments, where the wheat + soybean residue application recorded 20.90 % higher than the control. Root parameters like RLD, root surface area (RSA), root volume density (RVD), average root diameter (ARD) in soybean while these were partly non-significant (RSD and RVD) in wheat with the sequential tillage and crop establishment treatments, whereas the residue management practices significantly influenced the root parameters of both the crops. Among the residue management practices, wheat + soybean residue obtained higher RLD (2.57 and 1.03 cm/cm(3)); RSA (0.79 and 0.32 cm(2)/cm(3)); RVD (18.11 and 7.46 x 10(-3) cm(3)/cm(3)) and average root diameter (1.04 and 0.85 mm) both in soybean and wheat crops than rest of the treatments.

Water capture is limited by low water infiltration rates because many of our soils have relatively small aggregate size distributions, which limit infiltration, and are also susceptible to crusting and sealing. No-till management has permitted cropping intensification, which via improved water storage, has increased crop residue returned to the soil, decreased surface bulk density, and increased surface soil porosity. Our objective was to quantify the relationship between crop residue biomass generated by cropping system intensification and the physical properties of the surface soil (0-2.5-cm depth). This study was conducted within an existing long-term dryland experiment consisting of three sites in eastern Colorado that transect an evapotranspiration gradient. Each site transects a soil catena with three distinct soils arranged along a slope gradient. Only soils at the summit and toe slopes were sampled for this study. Soils are Argiustolls and Ustochrepts. Three no-till cropping systems, Wheat-Fallow (WF), Wheat-Corn-Fallow (WCF), and Continuous Cropping (CC), were sampled in the summer of 1998 after the cropping systems had been in place for 12 years. Bulk density, effective porosity, aggregate size distribution, sorptivity, and soil aggregate organic C content were measured at the surface 2.5 cm of the soil in each cropping system at the two soil positions at each site. Bulk density was reduced by 0.01 g cm(-3) for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition over the 12-year period. Each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition increased effective porosity by 0.3%. Increases in macroaggregation were associated with linear increases in the C content of the aggregates; each g kg(-1) of organic C in the macroaggregates increased the proportion of macroaggregates by 4.4%. Implementation of no-till intensive cropping systems under this semiarid environment increased, residue biomass, which has ultimately increased effective porosity, and thus water capture potential was increased.

Sustainable farming is based, in part, on the efficient management of soil microorganisms to improve soil quality. However, the identification of biological indicators of soil quality that can be used to predict weed suppression in soils has received little attention. We investigated differences in soil microbial activity among various crop and soil management systems to assess: (i) the microbiological characteristics of these soils; (ii) determine whether any relationships existed that might be used in the development of weed suppression. Soil enzyme activity, water-stable aggregates, and the proportions of weed-suppressive bacteria were compared among seven cropping systems and one native-prairie ecosystem in mid-Missouri, USA. Assays of soil enzymes (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase) revealed that organic and integrated cropping systems, and the native-prairie ecosystem had the highest levels of soil activity. Weed rhizospheres from these same ecosystems also had greater proportions of bacterial isolates characterized as “growth suppressive” to green foxtail (Setaria viridis [L.] Beauv.) and field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.): 15 and 10%, respectively. The proportion of water-stable soil aggregates was the greatest in soils with the highest organic matter and was found to be related to higher enzyme and weed-suppressive activity. Selected biological indicators of soil quality were associated with potential weed-suppressive activity in soil when that soil was managed for high organic matter content under reduced tillage systems. This research study provides further evidence that soil quality and sustainable agricultural practices may be linked to integrated weed management systems for the biological suppression of weeds.

Orchard in the Ozark Highlands,"The highly weathered, mineral, and often eroded and acidic soils of the Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas generally have low soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations as a result of rapid organic matter turnover rates in the warm, moist climate. Orchard management practices that can improve SOM may also improve other soil quality-related variables for sustained production, which is an explicit goal for the National Organic Program (NOP). Therefore, beginning in Mar. 2006 and continuing for seven seasons, annual applications of municipal green compost, shredded office paper, wood chips, and mow-blow grass mulch groundcover management systems (GMS) in combination with composted poultry litter, commercial organic fertilizer, or a non-fertilized control as a nutrient source were implemented to evaluate their ability to alter near-surface soil quality in a newly established, organically managed apple orchard in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas. The SOM concentration in the top 10 cm averaged 1.5% across all treatments at orchard establishment in 2006, but by 2012, SOM concentration had increased in all GMS and more than doubled to 5.6% under green compost. Similarly, soil bulk density in the top 6 cm, which averaged 1.34 g.cm(-3) among treatment combinations in 2006, decreased in all GMS by 2012. Either green compost or shredded paper had the largest concentration of total water-stable aggregates across all aggregate size classes in the top 7.5 cm, whereas no differences among GMS were observed in the 7.5- to 15-cm soil depth. Green compost applied alone or in combination with commercial fertilizer had the largest estimated plant-available water (17.9% v/v) among all treatment combinations. Many soil quality-related variables measured in the various organic GMS had numerically greater values compared with an adjacent conventionally managed orchard on the same soils. Implementation of these GMS appears to provide apple producers in the Ozark Highlands and similar regions a tangible means of meeting NOP requirements for improving soil quality concurrent with production of certified organic crops. The findings also have implications for conventionally managed orchards, which have maintaining or improving soil quality as a management goal.","Brye, Kristofor R.; Garcia, M.

The soils have high silt and clay fractions in the surface horizons, and soil texture vary remarkably from sandy to clayey both within and among the bottomlands. Bulk density averaged 0.96 g/cm(3) in the 30 cm topsoil layer and increased substantially to 1.57 g/cm(3) with depth. Non-capillary porosity averaged 0.287 and 0.127 cm(3)/cm(3) in the respective depth zones. Similarly, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) averaged 4.45 and 1.38 cm/h, respectively. The soils were well supplied with the exchangeable bases, especially Ca and Mg. Organic carbon levels were high, while available phosphorus was moderately high. The main constraints to agricultural production are the small size of the valley bottoms, low subsoil water transmission and poor drainage, and weed growth. Poor drainage can be alleviated by adapting the farming of the land to the wet condition, example, by growing rice or by introducing mound-tillage, and growing rice at the base and a toposequence of “dry foot” crops on the mounds. Mound-tillage with shallow drainage ditches can also be used to improve soil-water relations for dryland farming in the bottomlands. These soil and water management practices will enhance intensive uses of the potentially productive inland valley bottoms and increases in the productivity of the farmers.

Density of ground vegetation was lower in the undisturbed forest than in the jhum fallows. In general, 1-year jhum fallow had greater herbaceous vegetation both at lower and higher altitudes. Although woody plants were observed in 7- and 16-year-old jhum fallows, their density was highest in the forest. Soil moisture, organic C, and total N also increased gradually with increasing altitude and progressive secondary succession. Soil pH showed a negative correlation with altitude (as also confounded by soil type) and fallow age. Both microbial C and N had a close correlation with altitude and fallow age. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic C was 2.0-2.6% and microbial N to total N 1.4-2.2% in jhum fields, 2.4-4.3% and 1.2-2.1%, respectively, in jhum fallows, and 2.5-2.9% and 1.6-1.9% in the forests. Microbial C and N showed a negative correlation with herbaceous plant density. Microbial biomass in the jhum fallows and forest stands had a positive relationship with woody vegetation. Along an altitudinal and/or successional gradient, microbial C and N were positively correlated with water-holding capacity, soil moisture, organic C, and total N and negatively correlated with soil pH. Microbial C and N were positively correlated with each other.

Within one soil series, three different farming systems were selected, including a conventional and an organic arable system and permanent pasture without tillage. The old pasture represents optimal conditions in terms of soil structure and organic matter inputs and is characterized by high earthworm activity. More than 70 years of different management has caused significant differences in soil properties. SOM content, mineralization, earthworm activity and water-stable aggregation decreased as a result of tillage and arable cropping when compared with pasture, but were significantly greater under organic farming than under conventional farming. Total SOM contents between 0 and 20 cm depth amounted to 15, 24 and 46 g kg(-1) for the conventional arable, organic arable and permanent pasture fields, respectively. Although less sensitive to slaking than the conventionally managed field, the soil under organic farming was susceptible to compaction when high pressures were exerted on the soil under wet conditions. The beneficial effects of organic farming are generally associated with soil biochemical properties, but soil physical aspects should also be considered. Depending on soil type and climate, organic farmers need to be careful not to destroy the soil structure, so that they can enjoy maximum advantage from their organic farming systems.","Bouma, J; Jongmans, A; Marinissen, J; Pulleman, M",,19,2003,,,

Trotter)] crop in northern Ethiopia,"Tef crop shares the largest area of production in Ethiopia. However, its productivity is lower than 0.7 ton ha(-1) which is mainly related to low soil fertility and moisture. An experiment was conducted using tef on Chromic Cambisols for two rainy cropping seasons (2008-2009) in northern Ethiopia. The objective was to assess the short-term effects of tillage frequencies on selected soil properties under continuous tef cropping system. The layout of the experiment was randomized complete block design using three tillage treatments, namely, conventional plowing (T1), four times plowing (T2), and reduced plowing (T3). A statistically significant (P <= 0.05) effect of tillage treatments on soil moisture (SM) was determined during the experimental periods. SM was higher in T2 in both years followed by T3 in 2009. Soil physical properties (bulk density, BD; total porosity, TP; soil structural stability index, SSI) and soil nutrients (total nitrogen, TN; organic carbon, OC; cation exchange capacity, CEC; potassium, K) were significantly deteriorated by the application of T1 for consecutive two-years. The Paired-Samples T-Test showed significant improvements in these soil parameters due to T2 and T3 in 2009 as compared to the corresponded values in 2008. For example, there were significant increments in SM (11%), TP (18%), SSI (12%), TN (1.2 times), phosphorous (5%), OC (13%), and CEC (15%); but significantly decreased in OC: TN (48%) and BD (4%). Generally, despite the non-significant differences between the effects of T2 and T3, higher TP, SSI, OC, CEC; and lower BD were observed by T3 in 2009. Based on such short-term results of T3 it is possible to forecast its significant long-term effects on soil properties. Thus, for sustainable use of soil systems in the long-term due attention should be given to practice T3 as soil and water management practice in the study area conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A field study was carried out to investigate the effects of cover crops in organic no-till vegetables systems on changes in soil organic matter and CO2-C emissions, in dry and rainy seasons. We hypothesized that CO2-C emissions are higher in conventional till as compared with no-till, and that no-till increases soil C sink. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year cropping sequence involving two crops per year-cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) in winter and eggplant (Solanum melongena L) in summer time. Treatments were no-till on dead mulch of grass (Avena strigosa Schreb. and Zea mays L.), leguminous (Lupinus albus L and Crotalaria juncea L.), intercrop (grass and leguminous) and conventional till (no dead mulch) with rotary hoe arranged in a randomized block design on a clayey Oxisol (Typic Haplustox) at Domingos Martins-ES, Brazil. On 2012 and 2013, disturbed soil samples at three different layers (0-5,5-15 and 15-30 cm) and undisturbed samples at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm, for chemical and organic matter characterization were taken. CO2-C emissions and soil temperature were measured in situ on March, May, August and October 2012 and February 2013 (after 3 years of experiment). Conventional till site showed the lowest microporosity values and the highest macroporosity, followed by lower soil bulk density at 0-10 cm layer. Total organic C ranged from 34.94 to 50.48 g kg(-1) in intercrop and 27.11 to 43.74 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Total N ranged from 2.81 to 5.34 g kg(-1) in grass and 2.54 to 4.51 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Highest C stock was recorded in intercrop. Conventional till showed lower labile C values while recalcitrant C was higher in the intercrop treatment. The annual average of CO2-C emissions (mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) followed the order: grass (15.89) > intercrop (13.77) > leguminous (13.09) > conventional till (11.20). Highest annual average of soil temperature was recorded in conventional till (23.95 degrees C). Lowest annual mean of soil water content, microbial biomass C, and highest metabolic quotient were recorded in conventional till. These results suggest that the use of cover crops and organic compost in pre-planting promote C increments. The contribution of organic residues increases the water holding capacity and reduces soil temperature. No-till reduces soil disturbance and promotes a positive balance of C. Organic no-till vegetable systems is a strategy to increase soil C and should be encouraged in order to increase soil quality in the Atlantic Forest Biome in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this project were (i) to study the effects of variable-rate application of animal manure on selected topsoil quality parameters across site-specific management zones (MZs) and (ii) to evaluate the variable-rate applications of manure using risk-assessment tools of nitrogen (N) leaching and phosphorus (P) runoff indices to understand its impact on environmental quality. This study was conducted in northeastern Colorado on continuous and furrow-irrigated maize fields. Experimental strips, 4.5 m wide and 540 m long, spanned across all MZs with treatments nested within MZs in the field. Variable rates of dairy and beef feedlot manure applied on irrigated and dryland fields respectively ranged from 0 to 67 Mg ha(-1). Surface soil quality parameters evaluated before and after this study included bulk density, organic matter, water-holding capacity, electrical conductivity, and particle-size analysis. Results indicate that animal manure applications of 44 and 67 Mg ha(-1) significantly (P <= 0.05) increased soil organic matter and decreased bulk density of low- and medium-productivity-level MZs and had no significant impact on surface soil organic matter and bulk density of the high-productivity-level MZs. Animal manure significantly (P <= 0.05) increased surface soil water-holding capacity and soil electrical conductivity across zones; however, the maximum manure-induced soil EC was 1.0 dS m(-1), which was below levels regarded as potentially harmful for maize production. Soil texture was not affected by animal manure applications. Colorado N leaching and P index indicated no environmental hazard associated with variable rate application of animal manure across MZs. This study indicates that variable-rate application of animal manure across MZs has potential to improve or maintain soil quality parameters over time without impairing the environment.","Davis, J.

Three soil management treatments were: (1) natural forest, (2) traditional farming practice, and (3) topsoil removal. The SOC concentration was high in the surface layer of soil under natural forest and decreased sharply with depth. The SOC concentration of the 0-15 cm depth was significantly greater under natural forest (67 g kg(-1)) compared to the traditional farming (24 g kg(-1)) and topsoil removal (7 g kg(-1)) treatments. The depletion of SOC concentration in traditional farming and topsoil removal treatments decreased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates. In this strongly structured soil, the traditional farming treatment had no detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer by 52.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard, a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to achieving sustainable production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate changes due to the use and management intensities on some parameters associated with soil porosity and water storage in four sites in the Argentinian Pampas. At each site, farmer's fields with different agricultural types of management (Good Practices - GP-and Poor Practices - PP) and natural (Natural Environment NE) were selected. The lowest levels of total organic carbon (TOC) as a result of agricultural practices caused a decrease in soil total porosity, mainly reflected in a lower volume of macropores (>30 mu m), which decreased by 12% on average. Agricultural use resulted in soil compaction, although not critical, at the expense of a decrease of macropores, while differences between GP and PP were influenced by soil type. Regarding the type of soil, Argiudolls (silty soils), were more vulnerable to agricultural intensification, which increased degradation processes by compaction. The TOC and structural stability index (SSI) were the only variables where values lower than optimal in agricultural treatment were observed. Due to the clear relationship between physical properties and the SSI, the latter can be useful for assessing the impact of different uses and management intensities on the soil physical quality, where values < 6.13 can cause compaction problems.","Duval, Matias Ezequiel; Galantini, Juan Alberto; Lopez, Fernando Manuel; Martinez, Juan Manuel; Wall, Luis Gabriel",,,2015,,,

The proportions of C and N associated with clay and silt particles (i.e., “capacity level”), water-stable macro-aggregates (WSA) (>250 mum), particulate (POM) (>53 mum), and light fraction (U) organic matter, for the 0- to 10-cm soil depth, were assessed at 14 agricultural experimental sites established on Gleysolic, Podzolic, Luvisolic, and Brunisolic soils in the cool, humid region of eastern Canada. Organic C and N in the clay plus silt particles was at or near the capacity level for soils with clay plus silt content < 40%. For soils with >60% clay plus silt, the degree of saturation was 65-70% indicating a potential for further organic C and N retention. The mean proportion of C and N found in the POM was 22 and 27%, while the LF organic matter contained 7 and 5% C and N, respectively. Mean soil WSA content, determined by wet-sieving analysis, was 42% for air-dry soil and 54% for wetted soil, and was significantly (P < 0.05) related to both soil clay plus silt (r = 0.65) and organic C (r = 0.54). Water-stable macro-aggregate C content was proportional to soil organic C (r = 0.96, P < 0.01). At four of the sites, where soil C and N were influenced by management, an increasing level of soil organic C and N was associated with both the clay plus silt particles and the POM fraction until the former was saturated. Once the capacity level was saturated, further organic C and N accumulation was associated with the POM fraction. Although stabilized organic C and N in soil exists as a continuum, both soil particle and particulate fractions provided a practical approach to monitor, quantify and differentiate the storage and retention of C and N in soils of eastern Canada.","Angers, DA; Bolinder, MA; Carter, MR; Gregorich, EG",,83,2003,,,

The changes in the selected properties and heavy metal contents of three soil types in India were studied after incubating the respective mixtures for 90 days at near field capacity moisture level. Sewage sludge, due to its acidic and saline nature, high organic matter and heavy metals content, had more impact on soil properties than the fly ash. Sludge application produced several changes including an increase in available nitrogen, organic carbon, salinity and water-holding capacity of the soils. The concentrations of major cations and heavy metals also increased because of the sludge application and the pH was decreased. However, the levels of individual metal concentrations in all the mixture types were below the allowable limits prescribed by several environmental agencies. Using fly ash either alone or in equal quantity with sewage sludge had little influence on soil properties and heavy metal content.

This study provides highlights about improving soil properties for more effective water management with soil containers. Secondly, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of polyacrylamide (PAM), straw mulch (SM), and paper pellet (PP) on infiltration rate (IR), aggregate stability (AS) and water-holding capacity (WHC) of soil. Treatments were the application of PAM with irrigation water (10 mg.L-1), SM (1.25 and 2.5 kg.m(-2)), and waste PP (1.25 and 2.5 kg.m(-2)) mulching. The study results indicated that each treatment had particular effects on IR. PAM application had little effect on infiltration, and it was more effective on AS, when compared to other conditioners. SM and PP applications increased AS depending on the increase of organic matter content in the soil. PAM application at given concentrations had no significant effects on water-holding capacity. However, it can be inferred that other mulching applications had positive effects on field capacity and, thereby, on available water content depending on the mulching rate. It is well-known that the effect of PAM is observed especially during irrigation, and this is not permanent for soil amendment but has an instant effect for many conditions. However, using SM and PP is more appropriate, because of their low costs, more persistent effects, and opportunity to re-use residues.","Meral, Ramazan",,24,2015,,,

Specifically, we investigated the effects of PMR and composted PMR on total soil C and related these to changes in water-holding capacity and plant-available water (PAW). Amendment effects on irrigation requirements were estimated with a simple soil water balance model. The experimental design was replicated five times as a randomized complete block with four organic amendments: raw PMR, PMR composted alone (PMRC), PMR composted with bark (PMRB), and peat applied at two rates and a nonamended control. All amended treatments significantly increased total soil C relative to the nonamended control following applications in 1998 and 1999. One year following the second serial amendment, all PMR treatments increased PAW by 5 to 45% relative to the control. There was a significant positive linear relationship between total soil C and PAW. All amended treatments reduced the average amount of irrigation water required for potato production by 4 to 30% and the number of irrigation events by 10 to 90%. There was a clear trend of greater reduction in irrigation requirements with more carbon added.

Four sectors of the valley were sampled, each one including seven plots: recently ploughed after a long fallow period; 1 and 2 years under potato crop; 1, 4 5 and 8 years in fallow and natural vegetation. Each sector had similar topography, parent material and exposure to reduce the spatial heterogeneity that can hinder the synchronic analysis of the succession. Data of each sector were standardized before the statistics comparisons. Although all soils were acidic, those involved in the cropping cycle, or with only 1 year of fallow, had a significantly lower pH than the others, indicating that soil cultivation triggered off acidifying processes intense enough to overcome the strong buffering indices of the soils. These acidifying processes, facilitated by the acidity generating ions that widely dominate the desaturated CEC, are surely due to the stimulation of litter and soil organic matter mineralization after ploughing the soil and also to the N fertilization of the cultivated soils. The high soil contents of exchangeable Al3+ and free Al oxides suggest that Al plays an important role in SOM stabilization, lowering its mineralization. No successional increase of any main plant nutrient was found in soil or litter. Moreover, soil available P and litter-P contents are higher during the cultivation phase and at the beginning of the succession, probably as a consequence of fertilization. Water holding capacity was similar for all soils, indicating that this long fallow agriculture system does not change the water storage capability of the soil, an important aspect for the role of the paramo in the regional water balance. The main characteristics of soils and litters, including their delta C-13 values, were useless to monitor soil changes during cultivation and fallowing. Nevertheless, the delta N-15 values of SOM decreased steadily along the crop-fallow chronosequence, while those of litterfall were rather constant from recently ploughed to 1 year fallow soils, decreasing suddenly on medium fallow, plots and again on the virgin paramo. Together, the delta N-15 values of soil- and litter-N grouped the soils following the crop-fallow chronosequence, suggesting that a change from `open' to `closed' N cycling is the characteristic that better discriminates the soils along the succession.

Beef cattle manure applied at rates >30 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under dryland production and >60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) to soils under irrigation resulted in fewer dry-sieved aggregates >7.1 mm and more dry-sieved aggregates between 0.47 and 1.2 mm in the 0- to 5-cm depth, compared with unamended soils.

After four years of different tillage, a change in the water stability of soil aggregates (WSA) was evident. It was found out that reduced tillage of soil positively influenced both the WSA and the yield of the crops grown. A relationship of positive dependence between WSA, the content of humus substances, and cation exchange capacity of soil was also found. According to the obtained results, for agricultural practice a classification scale of structural quality was proposed on the basis of statistics of one variable (average, its mean error and distribution normality).","Badalikova, Barbora; Bartlova, Jaroslava; Pokorny, Eduard; Pospisilova, Lubica; Sarapatka, Borivoj",,10,2015,,,

This crop, as many others do, faces the loss of soil fertility, one of the most serious problems in agriculture, especially in arid lands. Regarding the importance of the organic matter in soil, we carried out experiments with the variety Anaheim THR 23(C) in an and soil. Three doses of compost were applied as treatments (25, 50, and 100t(.)ha(-1)). These applications were compared with a control without compost in order to determine the doses for major production. Soil humidity, field capacity, available moisture, total porosity, apparent and real density, and permanent wilting point were evaluated. Results showed that the highest doses improved all these physical characteristics of the soil. While there were no significant differences (P=0.05) between treatments, the best yield was obtained with the treatment of 25t(.)ha(-1). Based on the results, the latter dose is recommended for hot pepper production in and lands. Higher doses could be useful to improve physical soil conditions in the short term.","Garcia-Hernandez, JL; Larrinaga-Mayoral, JA; Murillo-Amador, B; Nieto-Garibay, A; Troyo-Dieguez, E",,27,2002,,,

There were differences in particle size distribution between dump and non-dump sites, Similarly, soil bulk density was lower by 9-13% while total porosity and hydraulic conductivity were higher by 9-14% and 240-463%, respectively, in the dump site relative to non-dump sites. Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and percent base saturation increased from 701 to 743, 646 to 740, 7% to 10% and 5% to 14%, respectively, in the dump site soil relative to non-dump site soil.

This study assessed the effects of slurry additions and soil physical properties on preferential flow and nitrate concentrations in two Mediterranean soils of central Chile under conventional agriculture management with long-term slurry additions. Two alluvial basins continuously cropped with maize (Zea mays) were selected, Pichidegua (Mollic Xerofluvent) and San Pedro (Fluventic Humixerept). Soils that had been amended with pig slurry were compared with unamended controls. Soil texture, bulk density, particle density, organic matter, porosity and hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were measured. Soil nitrate concentrations at different depths were determined every 2 weeks during the study, and a dye tracer test using Brilliant Blue FCF was conducted on each soil. Digital picture analysis was then performed to classify flow types in the soil profiles through the distribution of stained path width. Stained path width allowed classification of soil flow types. Preferential flow showed no evidence of being affected by pig slurry; the stained patterns were mainly explained by tillage and soil physical properties, such as texture and Ks. Matrix flow-types in the first horizon grading to macropore flow-types at depth characterised all profiles, except San Pedro amended soil, where homogeneous matrix flow dominated through the entire profile. Concentrations of nitrate showed temporal variation during the measurement season, mainly due to the mineralisation-immobilisation budget and leaching, both triggered by Mediterranean climate conditions. Physical properties helped to explain nitrate distribution in the studied soils.","Casanova, Manuel; Fuentes, Ignacio; Najera, Francisco; Padarian, Jose; Salazar, Osvaldo; Seguel, Oscar",,53,2015,,,

We have studied the evolution of the structure under changing land use in two Ferralsols under a native Cerrado and under pasture sowed after recent clearing by measuring bulk density. We studied the microaggregates' characteristics and resulting porosity using scanning electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry, respectively. Microaggregates 50-300 mum in diameter are attributed to termites. They were in a much closer arrangement from the surface to 1 m depth under pasture than under Cerrado. Larger microaggregates, 500-1000 mum in diameter, that are closely packed, resulted from earthworm activity. They were more numerous under pasture than under Cerrado. Thus within a few years, clearing and grazing have caused a dramatic decrease in microstructure that is one of the rare favourable characteristics of Ferralsols for agriculture. This evolution that affects the subsoil to 80-90 cm cannot be attributed to compaction by mechanical deforestation alone but seems to result from a change in the faunal activity in the soil. Finally, the packing of the clay particles within the microaggregates was similar whatever the type of microaggregate and land use. Our results accord with earlier studies showing that the porosity resulting from clay packing varies little in Ferralsols in which the fine material is mainly kaolinite.","Balbino, LC; Brossard, M; Bruand, A; Grimaldi, M; Guimaraes, MF; Hajnos, M",,53,2002,,,

Our objectives were: i) to quantify the effects of organic materials on soil C and N accumulation; ii) to evaluate the effects of organic materials on soil aggregate stability, along with the total organic carbon (TOC), and N in different aggregate fractions; and iii) to assess the relationships among the organic material components, soil C and N, and C, N in aggregate fractions. The trial was conducted in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, China. The organic materials were incorporated at an equal rate of C, and combined with a mineral fertilizer in amounts of 150 kg N ha(-1), 26 kg P ha(-1) and 124 kg K ha(-1) respectively during each crop season of a wheat-maize rotation system. The inputted C quantity of each organic material treatment was equivalent to the total amount of C contained in the crop straw harvested in CS treatement in the previous season. TOC, N, water-stable aggregates, and aggregate-associated TOC and N were investigated. The results showed that organic material incorporation increased soil aggregation and stabilization. On average, the soil macroaggregate proportion increased by 14%, the microaggregate proportion increased by 3%, and mean-weight diameter (MWD) increased by 20%. TOC content followed the order of PM>WR>MR>BR>CS>CK>CF; N content followed the order WR>PM>MR>BR>CS>CF>CK. No significant correlation was found between TOC, N, and the quality of organic material. Soil silt and clay particles contained the largest part of TOC, whereas the small macroaggregate fraction was the most sensitive to organic materials. Our results indicate that PM and WR exerted better effects on soil C and N accumulation, followed by MR and BR, suggesting that organic materials from ex situ farmland could promote soil quality more as compared to straw returned in situ.","Bin-bin, Wang; Jian-xiong, Huang; Juan-xiu, Zou; Ling-ling, Yan; Pan, Long; Peng, Sui; Peng, Yan; Wang-sheng, Gao; Yuan-quan, Chen",,14,2015,,,

Soil organic carbon in the surface 75 mm was 2.6% under long-term pasture compared with 1.1% in rigorously tilled cropping paddocks. Readily oxidisable carbon concentrations were 2.3 mg/g and 1.0 mg/g, respectively. These differences were negatively correlated with the number of years cropped, which we viewed with concern. Infiltration rate was greater and shear strength less in cropped paddocks compared with long-term pasture. Dry bulk density was greater and total porosity and macroporosity were less in rigorously tilled paddocks. Subsoil compaction was apparent in paddocks which had grown potatoes.

A study was conducted on loam to silty clay loam krasnozems (Ferrosols) near Ballarat in south-western Victoria to assess changes in soil C, soil structural stability, and C chemistry, at the 0-10 cm soil depth, under 3 paired sites consisting of adjacent long-term forest (Monterey pine or eucalyptus) v. 30 year cropping [3 year pasture-2 year crops (potato and a root crop or grain)]. Soil structural stability was also characterised in the A and B horizons under long-term eucalyptus and several cropped sites. Organic C levels in the A horizons for all the soils were relatively high, ranging from 46 to 89 g/kg. A lower organic C (30%), associated mainly with loss of the sand-sized (> 53 mum) macro-C fraction, and a decrease in exchangeable Ca and Mg was found in the agricultural soils, compared with forest soils. Physically protected C in the <53 &mu;m fraction, as indicated by UV photo-oxidation, was similar among soils. Wet sieving indicated a decline of both C and N concentration in water-stable aggregates and the degree of macro-aggregation under agricultural soils, compared with the forest soils. However, soil structural changes under cropping were mainly related to a decline in the >5 mm sized aggregates, with no deleterious increase in the proportion of 0.10 mm aggregates. Solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy indicated a decrease in O-alkyl and alkyl C under pasture and cropping compared with forest soils, which was in agreement with the decline in the macro-C fraction. Characterisation of C chemistry following UV photo-oxidation showed that charcoal C (dominant presence of aryl C) accounted for 30% of the total soil organic C, while other functional groups (polysaccharides and alkyl C) were probably protected within micro-aggregates. Based on soil organic C and aggregate stability determinations alone, the implications for soil physical quality, soil loss, and diffuse pollution appear minimal.","Carter, MR; MacEwan, RJ; Skjemstad, JO",,40,2002,,,

The sites were comparable in terms of climate, soil texture and land-use history, but differed in the duration of agricultural abandonment, covering 1, 7, 12, 17 and 42 years of self-restoration. During self-restoration without direct human impact, the vegetation developed towards a steppe with dominance of Artemisia lercheana/pauciflora and Stipa pennata. After 17 years, the abundance of Artemisia pauciflora indicated again the Solonetz locations within the Calcisol-Solonetz complex, which were not visible during arable land use. Pedogenesis resulted in the recovery of the natural soil structure-fine subangular polyhedral for Calcisol and crumble fine platy for Solonetz. The recovery of soil structure of Solonetz was in accordance with a decline of water-stable aggregates from 84% to 68%. The plow features were still well visible after 42 years of self-restoration in both soil groups. Partial integration of Btn materials into the plow layer induced a pH increase during cultivation of the Solonetzes, while slight pH decreases were observed during self-restoration afterwards. Other chemical properties of both soil groups remained unchanged. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed an exchange sodium percentage (ESP) below 5.0% and an electrical conductivity (ECe) below 50 mS m(-1) at the topsoil during the period of self-restoration. The development towards natural soils was observed in terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. SOC stocks of the Calcisols increased slowly from 2.0 to 3.5 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-0.5 m, comprising 64% of the natural soil. SOC stocks of the Solonetzes grew from 1.7 to 3.1 kg m(-2) in the upper 0-05 m and almost reached the level of natural soil already after 12 years of self-restoration. The long-term modelling showed a recovery of SOC stocks almost after 100 years for the Calcisol and the Solonetz chronosequences. The nutrient dynamics traced SOC dynamics during the self-restoration. The investigation of different carbon pools showed a significant organic carbon (OC) enrichment of the density fractions <1.8 g cm(-3) (free particulate organic material (POM) and occluded POM) and the density fractions >1.8 g cm(-3) (sand coarse/medium silt, fine silt, clay) following an increase of total SOC during self-restoration. In the Calcisol chronosequence, the dynamics of all fractions was close to the dynamics of total SOC with the exception of free POM showing a moderate accumulation rate in relation to total SOC. Post-agrogenic Solonetzes showed a more intensive accumulation of free POM and a slower OC sequestration in aggregates compared to total SOC. Both chronosequences showed comparable recovery rates for the passive SOC pool and total SOC. Despite all these alterations the study showed no full restoration for many parameters within the chronosequential time scale of 42 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Barmin, A.

In this research, the impact of OMW on water retention, saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and capillary rise of three soils, loam, clay loam, and dune sand, has been investigated under laboratory conditions. Application of OMW resulted in an increase in water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity but caused a decrease in capillary rise and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for all soils tested.

Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 and 10-20cm from a total of 12 fields which had been under CA for two and four seasons, respectively, and from adjacent RT fields for direct comparisons. CA fields were converted from fields previously under continuous RT. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus were greater in CA fields while extractable potassium, pH and salt content were moderated under CA. Conversion of long-term RT to CA did not significantly influence bulk density and aggregate stability (geometric mean diameter) although structural stability was greater under CA practices. Total porosity, macroporosity and matrix porosity, and volumetric water content at saturation, field capacity and permanent wilting point did not substantively respond to tillage effects. Relative water capacity and air-water storage parameter, (fc)/PORt, were significantly greater after 4yr of CA. Soils under CA showed greater values for field-saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with RT fields. With the highest loadings in a principal component analysis, this work suggests that variables related to volumetric water content and aeration of the soil matrix, organic carbon, available phosphorus and soil texture were the most useful indices for future field comparison of RT and CA practices.","Cornelis, W.

Therefore, this study investigates the influence of management on soil properties acquired at different depths, and yields, at five different field sites within Ohio, USA. The principal management systems considered were no till with or without manure and cover crops, natural vegetation (NV) or forest, and conventional tillage (CT) defined as farms with surface residue cover (< 30 %). Analyses of variance (ANOVA), correlation analyses, stepwise regression, and the principal component analyses (PCA) were used to elucidate and model the link between four different management practices and the soil physical and chemical properties. The ANOVA results indicate that the available water capacity and electrical conductivity (EC) were the major variables affected by management. In contrast, soil pH, bulk density (rho (b)), porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were invariable with management, yet only pH and EC did not significantly vary with the interaction of soil type and management effects. In comparison, the PCA results suggest that SOC, TN, porosity, rho (b), and EC were the major determining factors controlling yield variability. Interestingly, the derived models revealed that the highest yields, notably 10 and 2.7 Mg ha(-1) for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) occurred in soils under CT management. Quantifying the nexus between soil properties and management choices as demonstrated in this study, can provide critical insight for sustainable agricultural production.","Lal, Rattan; Obade, Vincent de Paul",,72,2014,,,

Here we examined the effects of five plant species on soil aggregate water stability. The five species (three grasses, one forb, and a legume) were from the same natural grassland, and were grown in monoculture plots in the field. Our first goal was to test if productivity-related or species-specific factors would prevail in determining soil aggregation. We also tested what the relative importance of the soil protein glomalin (produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF) in soil aggregation is, compared to other factors, including AMF hyphal and root length and percent plant cover. We found significant differences in soil aggregate water stability (1-2 mm size class) for the five plant species examined, and corresponding differences in plant cover, root weight and length, AMF soil hyphal length, and glomalin concentrations. A structural equation modeling approach (path analysis) was used to distinguish direct from indirect effects of factors on soil aggregation based on covariance structures. Root length, soil glomalin, and percent cover contributed equally strong paths to water-stable aggregation. The direct effect of glomalin was much stranger than the direct effect of AMF hyphae themselves, suggesting that this protein is involved in a very important hypha-mediated mechanism of soil aggregate stabilization, at least for the 1-2-mm size class of aggregates.","Eviner, VT; Rillig, MC; Wright, SF",,238,2002,,,

Decision making for sustainable management could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns. Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions. We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI. Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices: land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at least 85% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an average R(2) = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.","Andrews, SS; Carroll, CR",,11,2001,,,

Aggregate stability (AS) is considered by some authors to be a property that provides information on soil quality. It's also a property that is highly influenced by land use and management. This study aims to identify the long-term changes in soil aggregation and related properties comparing forest and agricultural land use in Mediterranean calcareous soils. For the research, seven study sites with different soil characteristics located in Alicante Province (E Spain) were chosen to compare the overall effect of land use change from agriculture to forestry on soil aggregation. At every site, samples of the same soil type were collected from agricultural land (dry crops with conventional tillage management using ploughing), and nearby forest, where agriculture was abandoned between 20 and 50 years ago. Selected physical and chemical properties like: texture, total content of aggregates (TCA), aggregate stability (AS), organic matter content (OM), carbonates, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and water repellency (WR) were analysed on the collected soil samples. As expected, in all soils, the AS was significantly lower in agricultural sites than in forest sites. But in some cases the differences were much higher than in others. In forest sites the AS varied between 46 and 82% while in agricultural sites it ranged between 14 and 45%. The results showed strong positive correlation of AS with OM. The lowest values of AS in forest areas were found in wettable sandy soils. The relative increase of AS in forest soils compared to agricultural land use ranged from 39 to 79%. These differences can be explained mainly by some soil properties, such as OM content, texture, and WR. In particular, the lower OM content and absence of WR are responsible for the lower values of AS in agricultural land use due to the long-term conventional tillage management. Soil WR was found in three of the sites, and its presence plays a key role in soil aggregation and its stability, especially for sandy soils. The MWD was in most cases higher in forest than in agricultural sites, except for two wettable sandy soils with the lowest initial AS. In the case of carbonates, no correlations were found with AS, and only in the group of sandy soils, significant positive correlations between carbonates and TCA and with MWD were found. In conclusion we can say that the prolonged use of conventional tillage management using ploughing has a strong influence on AS in all types of soils studied in this research. The recovery after decades of land use abandonment not only is dependent on how is the increase of soil OM content, but also is controlled by some soil properties such as the texture and the presence of WR. In some cases the presence of hydrophobic substances can play a key role in the formation and stabilization of soil aggregates, contributing to maintaining good levels of OM and avoiding higher levels of soil degradation.

The compacting effects of cultivation were reflected in the higher bulk density, the decrease of total porosity soil aggregate stability and of coarse pores. In the uncultivated areas a more crumby structure was observed, whereas in the tilled soils a subangular, cracky microstructure was developed. The cultivated soils showed a decrease of soil organic matter, of CECeff, a loss of nutrients, a reduced microbial activity, a reduction of root growth and faunal activities in the tillaged horizons. In the Hungarian soil an enhanced content of heavy metals (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sr, Zn) were found due to application of high dosages of P-fertilizers. In Austria a higher Cd-content could be traced. The microbial activities (SIR, basal respiration, DRA) were strongly positive correlated to the amount of soil organic matter and to the N-t content in the soils. The ergosterol/C-mic-ratio, showed that the fungal distribution in the soils was mostly influenced by the pH-value. The physiological status (qCO(2)) of the soil microorganisms in the arable soils was governed by the input of easily degradable organic materials. The C-mic/C-org-ratio of the reference soils expressed the natural equilibrium between input and output of organic matter. In the arable soils this equilibrium was disturbed. The effects of different cultivation systems on the earthworm population could not be definitively evaluated because of the very dry conditions during analyses.","Mentler, A; Rampazzo, N",,52,2001,,,

This study was done in an area of 900 km(2) in the semi-arid agricultural region of Hashtroud in northwestern Iran to determine the relationship between soil productivity and soil erodibility. Wheat grain yield (WGY) and soil erodibility factor (K) were measured separately at 108 plots in 36 dry-farming lands under natural rainfall conditions for a two-year period from March 2005 to March 2007. Based on the results, significant differences were observed among the lands in WGY (P < 0.001) and K (P < 0.001). These differences were attributed to variations of soil properties among the lands. There was a negative relationship between WGY and K (R-2 = 0.77). Multiple regression analysis indicated that both WGY and K were significantly related to aggregate stability and infiltration rate, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 and 0.90, respectively. Organic matter and calcium carbonate equivalent were the most effective soil properties that enhanced both aggregate stability and infiltration rate. The study revealed that soils with a lower percentage of water-stable aggregates and a lower infiltration rate also tended to have a higher susceptibility to erosion and a lower potential for crop production.","Bahrami, H.

The project includes four-year crop rotations under conventional (conv-4), low-input, and organic management and a conventionally managed, two-year rotation (conv-2). Positive effects on soil quality resulting from low-input and organic management include increased soil organic matter, a reduction in soil-borne diseases, increased pools of P and K, higher microbial biomass and activity, an increase in mobile humic acids and increased water infiltration rates and soil water-holding capacity. Pesticide use in the low-input cropping system is about 25% of that used in the conventional systems. The most profitable farming system continues to be the conv-2 system due to the greater frequency of tomato in that rotation. Among the four-year rotations, the organic system, in which the produce commands premium prices, is the most profitable, although least profitable if premium prices are not applied. Information generated from SAFS research has been disseminated via videotape, workshops, annual field days, field tours, educational materials, peer-reviewed articles and an Internet homepage. Future challenges for the SAFS project include development of reduced-tillage and cover crop management strategies to optimize N availability following cash crops; weed management in organic and low-input systems, improvement of water-use efficiency in alternative systems and sequestration of C in the soil.","Ferris, H; Horwath, WR; Klonsky, K; Lanini, WT; Mitchell, JP; Poudel, DD; Scow, KM; Temple, SR; van Bruggen, AHC",,30,2001,,,

To explore these relations, we tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration, drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution; soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0.30, p < 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia analysis: RV= 0.35, p<0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0.42, p<0.01), as was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) =0.43, p <0.01), Isoptera (r(2) =0.30, p<0.01), Diplopoda (r(2) =0.31, p <0.01), and Formicidae (r(2) = 0.13, p<0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) =0.38, p<0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r(2)<0.10). Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia, indicating that soil macrofauna have an engineering and/or indicator function.

While it has been shown that macroaggregates contain more microbial biomass per unit soil mass than microaggregates, it is unclear how microbial diversity varies with soil aggregation. We investigated the functional diversity (catabolic potential) of bacteria, evaluated by calculating Shannon's diversity index (H'), substrate richness (S) and substrate evenness (E) from potential substrate utilization patterns, in whole soil (i.e. not separated into different aggregate sizes) and aggregates of different sizes (2-4, 1-2, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5, and 0.1-0.25 mm diameter) in loam and silt loam soils grown to barley and managed for 6 years under conventional tillage (CT) or zero tillage (ZT) systems in northern British Columbia. There were no significant tillage effects on bacterial diversity in whole soils. In soil aggregates, H' and E were significantly higher under CT than under ZT on the loam at barley planting time, with no significant aggregate size effects. However, at barley-heading stage, all diversity indices in both soils were significantly higher under ZT than under CT, and they tended to increase with increasing aggregate size. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis of substrate utilization patterns also revealed differences in bacterial community structures between CT and ZT,but the substrates that were utilized differently between the two tillage systems were not the same between soil types or sampling times. The results during the cropping cycle imply that deterioration of soil structure is probably one factor that explains the adverse effects of soil tillage on soil microbial biomass and diversity.

Accurate estimates of the distribution of soil C and N stores and their relationship to crop yield are crucial to developing appropriate cropland management policies. The current study examined the spatial variation of soil organic C (SOC), total soil N (TSN), and associated variables in the surface layer (0-40 cm) of soils from intensive agricultural systems in 19 counties within Henan Province, China, and compared these patterns with crop yield. Mean soil C and N concentrations were 14.9 g kg(-1) and 1.37 g kg(-1), respectively, whereas soil C and N stores were 4.1 kg m(-2) and 0.4 kg m(-2), respectively. Total crop production of each county was significantly, positively related to SOC, TSN, soil C and N store, and soil C and N stock. Soil C and N were positively correlated with soil bulk density but negatively correlated with soil porosity. These results indicate that variations in soil C could regulate crop yield in intensive agricultural systems, and that spatial patterns of C and N levels in soils may be regulated by both climatic factors and agro-ecosystem management. When developing suitable management programs, the importance of soil C and N stores and their effects on crop yield should be considered.","Cha, Feina; Gilliam, Frank S.; Li, Chaohai; Wang, Qun; Wang, Yilun; Zhang, Xuelin",,9,2014,,,

In a sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] field experiment in which CO2 [supplied using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology] was crossed factorially with an irrigation treatment, soil aggregate (1-2 mm) water stability increased in response to elevated CO2. Aggregate water stability was increased by 40% and 20% in response to CO2, at ample and limited water supply treatments, respectively. Soil hyphal lengths of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increased strongly (with a threefold increase in the dry treatment) in response to CO2, and the concentrations of one fraction (easily extractable glomalin, EEG) of the AMF-produced protein glomalin were also increased. Two fractions of glomalin, and AMF hyphal lengths were all positively correlated with soil aggregate water stability. The present results further support the hypothesis that AMF can become important in global change scenarios. Although in this field study a causal relationship between hyphal length, glomalin and aggregate stability cannot be demonstrated, the present data do suggest that AMF could mediate changes in soil structure under elevated CO2. This could be of great importance in agricultural systems threatened by erosional soil loss.","Kimball, BA; Leavitt, SW; Ottman, MJ; Pinter, PJ; Rillig, MC; Wall, GW; Wright, SF",,7,2001,,,

Soil organic carbon in the top 150 mm was 2.7% under long-term pasture compared with 1.8% in rigorously tilled cropping paddocks, and microbial biomass C values were 194 and 129 mg/kg, respectively. Readily oxidisable organic C concentrations were 1.8 mg/g and 1.3 mg/g, respectively. Infiltration rate was greater in paddocks with shallow tillage cropping than longterm pasture but was 43% less in paddocks which had grown potatoes and 70% less after a wet potato harvest. Dry aggregate-size showed no change under shallow tillage cropping compared with long-term pasture but decreased significantly in more rigorously tilled potato cropping paddocks.

These newer cropping systems are often considered to be more sustainable. We examine the agronomic, environmental, and economic effects of reducing summer fallow use and including grain lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) in rotation with spring wheat(Triticum aestivum L.). Data from a long-term crop rotation experiment conducted on a medium texture soil at Swift Current, Saskatchewan were analyzed. Four cropping systems were evaluated over the 1979 to 1997 period; namely, fallow-wheat (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W), continuous wheat (W), and wheat-lentil(W-l). Nitrate leaching below the 120 cm rooting depth of wheat was lower under continuously cropped systems than under fellow-based rotations, and was lowest overall for W-L. Wheat, whether grown on fallow or stubble, used almost all of the available water in the 0-120 cm depth soil profile, but lentil extracted about 1.5 cm less water than wheat. On average, wheat yield was unaffected by inclusion of lentil in the rotation; however, grain protein content was higher in 11 of 18 years. The incidence of leaf spotting diseases in wheat was lowest for wheal grown after lentil and highest for wheat grown on Fallow. Soil quality (soil organic carbon, mineralizable N and C, light fraction organic C, and water stable aggregates) increased with cropping intensity in the order of W-L greater than or equal to W > F-W-W > F-W. Although inputs of non-renewable energy and CO2 emissions were higher Ibr the continuous compared to fallow-based rotations, including lentil in the rotation lowered the energy requirements for N fertilizer and provided an overall 19%, reduction in CO2 emissions. The economics favored the W-L system whenever lentil price was above $350 t(-1). The level of financial risk was lowest for F-W and F-W-W, intermediate for W-L. and highest for W. Our findings confirm the recent changes in land use practices being adopted by producers, and clearly show that extending and diversifying crop rotations by reducing fallow and including pulse crops in the rotation will improve the overall sustainability of agricultural production in this semiarid region.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of rates of pig slurry application in agricultural areas on soil physical and chemical properties and on the mobility of glyphosate through the soil profile. The study was carried out in the 12 th year of an experiment with pig slurry applied at rates of 0 (control), 50, 100 and 200 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) on a Latossolo Vermelho distrofico (Hapludox) soil. In the control, the quantities of P and K removed by harvested grains were replaced in the next crop cycle. Soil physical properties (bulk density, porosity, texture, and saturated hydraulic conductivity) and chemical properties (organic matter, pH, extractable P, and exchangeable K) were measured. Soil solution samples were collected at depths of 20, 40 and 80 cm using suction lysimeters, and glyphosate concentrations were measured over a 60-day period after slurry application. Soil physical and chemical properties were little affected by the pig slurry applications, but soil pH was reduced and P levels increased in the surface layers. In turn, K levels were increased in sub-surface layers. Glyphosate concentrations tended to decrease over time but were not affected by pig slurry application. The concentrations of glyphosate found in different depths show that the pratice of this application in agricultural soils has the potential for contamination of groundwater, especially when the water table is the surface and heavy rains occur immediately after application.","Pinheiro, Adilson; da Veiga, Milton; de Oliveira, Daniela Aparecida",,38,2014,,,

Was observed great variation of soil resistance to penetration throughout the soybean and corn cycles, with its highest values were found in the surface layers. The NT showed greater resistance to penetration.

This study investigated the impacts of 3 grazing intensities (heavy, medium, and light) and 4 forages on selected soil physical and chemical parameters of a Typic Haplustoll at Lacombe, Alberta. Measurements were conducted on soil samples collected at the beginning (1993) and the end (1996) of the study. Two perennial forages, smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis cv. `Carlton') and meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius cv. `Paddock'), and 2 annuals, a mixture of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack cv. `Pika') and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. LAC Lacombe') and triticale alone were used for the study. Grazing intensity or forage species did not affect carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Grazing intensity influenced changes in available water holding capacity for the 0-5 cm interval, soil nitrogen for the 30-45 cm interval, soil pH for the 5-15 cm interval and electrical conductivity for all depth intervals except for the 0-5 cm interval (P less than or equal to 0.05). Forage species affected changes in soil carbon in the 0-5 cm interval, soil pH between 0 and 15 cm, and electrical conductivity between 5 and 45 cm (P less than or equal to 0.05). Soil electrical conductivities for all grazing levels and forage treatments were within the range (i.e. 0-2 dS m(-1)) considered to have negligible effects on plant growth. The minimal effects of grazing and plant species on soil parameters in this study may have been due to the resilient intrinsic properties of the sail and/or the short study length.","Baron, VS; Chanasyk, DS; Mapfumo, E; Naeth, MA",,53,2000,,,

We investigated the effects of deep-burrowing earthworm species on soil structure at the surface of chisel-plowed or ridge-tilled cropping systems in Pike County, OH, planted to corn (Zea mays L.). Earthworm populations were experimentally manipulated in field enclosures by adding predominantly deep-burrowing Lumbricus terrestris L., or leaving enclosures unmodified in each tillage system. In 1995, after 2 years of hi-annual additions, we measured surface residue cover, dry sieved aggregates (DSA)- and water-stable aggregates (WSA), and carbon and nitrogen concentration of aggregates by size class, in each treatment combination. Also, in 1998, we used tension infiltrometry to examine crusting effects at the soil surface among earthworm treatments in the chisel-plow treatment. Earthworm additions yielded increased density and biomass of L. terrestris than ambient controls, and to a greater extent in the ridged corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Mess.)wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CSW) than corn-soybean (CS) rotation. Percentage residue cover in CS cropping decreased with earthworm additions. Earthworm additions decreased the geometric mean weight diameter (GMWD) of DSA and WSA in chisel-plow treatment compared to no additions. Earthworm additions influenced carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios for smaller DSA and WSA. Water-stable aggregate C/N decreased with size class. The overall effect of earthworm additions was an increase in deep-burrowing earthworms, a decrease in surface residue cover, and more pronounced crusting, which decreased mesopore conductivity.

Thus, a two years (2009-2011) field study was conducted on a terraced land (980 m a.s.l.) to study the impact of land configuration, tillage and residue management on soil properties under rainfed groundnut-rapeseed cropping system. The treatments were: (i) farmers' practice (FP) (flat bed - residue removal, 3-4 times ploughing); (ii) broad bed and furrow (BBF) with in situ residue incorporation; (iii) BBF with in situ residue + hedge leaves {white hoary pea, Tephrosia candida (Roxb.)

Soil profile moisture content was higher under residue retention/incorporation and altered land configuration than that under FP. Water infiltration rate (11.2 mm/h) and hydraulic conductivity (6.98 mm/h) in soil under RB with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) were significantly higher (P = 0.05), than that under FP (7.65 mm/h and 3.35 mm/h) after two cropping cycles. Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) was significantly higher under RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation (3811.1 mu g/g soil and 276 mu g/g soil) than that under FP. Dehydrogenase activity (DHA) was the highest in RB with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) (57.8 mu g TPF/g soil/24 h). Soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient content improved under residue management. RB with residue + hedge leaves mulching (NT) resulted in the maximum SOC stock, and it was 2.0 Mg/ha and 2.7 Mg/ha higher than that of the antecedent level and FP, respectively. The average groundnut equivalent yield (GEY) was significantly the highest in RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation (2815 kg/ha) followed by that under RB with residue incorporation (2747 kg/ha). Water use efficiency (WUE) of rapeseed was the maximum in RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation (4.64 kg/ha - mm) and the minimum under FP (1.49 kg/ha - mm).

Twenty-four of the initial 42 variables chosen for their significant response to differences among farming systems were used in a principal component analysis to understand their relationships with the agro-ecosystems studied. The chemical, physical and biological soil properties considered contributed to a single dominant factor (PCI) of agricultural soil health representing soil organic matter dynamics. Conventional, uncertified organic and certified organic potato agro-ecosystems were lowest, intermediate and highest, respectively, on the PCI gradient. Conventional potato systems were characterized by high erosion, high soil bulk density, high soil test sulphur and phosphorus and high bacterial counts. Certified organic potato systems formed a separate group with the reference ecosystems (i.e., pasture and abandoned potato field under long-term rejuvenation). This group was characterized by high soil organic carbon, high soil aggregate stability, high soil water-holding capacity and high meso-and macro-fauna counts. The uncertified organic potato production system and organic barley system were characterized by average values, intermediate between conventional and certified organic potato systems. Results confirmed the strong negative impact of intensive cycles of conventional potato production on soil health. The clear separation observed between conventional, uncertified organic and organic potato ecosystems indicates that the positive impact of rotations and other management practices must be sustained over long periods for full rehabilitation of soils previously under intensive potato production.

In this study, we examined six North American agroecosystems with respect to the effects of NT vs. CT management systems on the accrual of microbial cell-wall residues in surface soil. We used total amino sugar contents to estimate living and decomposing microbial cell-wall mass in soil and the contents of glucosamine and muramic acid to separate fungal and bacterial contributions to microbial-derived soil organic matter (SOM). Compared with estimates of glucosamine and muramic acid present in living biomass of fungi and bacteria, total concentrations of these compounds (745-2076 mg glucosamine kg(-1) soil and 37-79 mg muramic acid kg(-1) soil) were larger by factors of 54 to 745 and 26 to 82, respectively. At three sites, the ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid in NT soils (32.0, 30.0, 42.2) significantly exceeded those in the respective CT soils (18.8, 22.1, 23.0) because of a higher enrichment of glucosamine. This coincided with higher values for fungal biomass, particulate organic matter carbon (POMC), mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (MWD), and total organic carbon (TOC). Analysis of aggregate-size classes showed that the additional glucosamine accumulated in >53-mm aggregates but not in smaller particles. The enrichment of SOM in fungal-derived glucosamine suggests that the accrual of hyphal cell-wall residues is an important process in the three NT agroecosystems which leads to higher SOM storage in surface soil concurrent with an increase in aggregate stability. The other soils, having a lower clay plus silt content, exhibited no significant differences in POM-C, MWD, and total amino sugars between NT and CT management systems. We suggest that at lower clay plus silt contents the beneficial potential for NT to sequester microbial-derived SOM is lower because of limited physical stabilization.","Elliott, ET; Frey, SD; Guggenberger, G; Paustian, K; Six, J",,63,1999,,,

Accordingly, a suite of complementary soil physical and hydraulic parameters was measured using intact core samples to determine the SPQ of a Brookston clay loam under a long-term (48 yr) cropping, fertilization and land management study at Woodslee, Ontario. The SPQ under virgin woodlot, fertilized monoculture sod and unfertilized monoculture sod treatments was similar, with optimal SPQ occurring in the top 10-20 cm, but severely suboptimal SPQ occurring below 30 cm because bulk density (BD), relative field capacity (RFC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) were excessive, and because organic carbon (OC), air capacity (AC) and plant-available water capacity (PAWC) were critically low. The SPQ for fertilized and unfertilized monoculture corn under fall moldboard plow tillage was similar and substantially suboptimal throughout the top 40-50 cm due to high or excessive BD and RFC, critically low OC, low or critically low AC and PAWC, and KS that varied erratically from excessive to critically low. The SPQ under fertilized and unfertilized corn-oat-alfalfa-alfalfa rotations (corn and second-year alfalfa fall plowed) was similar and largely non-optimal below 10 cm, but largely optimal in the top 10 cm due to the ameliorating effects of numerous biopores and crop roots. A bimodal soil water release function fitted to release curve data showed that PAWC was determined by soil matrix porosity (P-M), and AC was determined by soil structure porosity (P-S). Strong inverse linear correlations between BD vs. P-M, BD vs. PS and BD vs. OC provided site-specific estimates of optimal ranges and critical limits for PAWC, AC and OC, respectively. Although SPQ changed substantially among treatments, the changes did not extend below 30- to 40-cm depth, and were largely unaffected by long-term annual fertilization. The SPQ below 30- to 40-cm depth was similarly poor across all treatments, and is likely an inherent characteristic of the soil.","Drury, C. F.; Reynolds, W. D.; Tan, C. S.; Yang, J. Y.; Yang, X.

Our objective was to assess the impact of DPS incorporation on organic matter and aggregation of a clay loam (Typic Dystrochrept) and a silty clay loam (Typic Humaquept), Whole soil C, particulate (>53 mu m) and light fraction (density <1.8 Mg m(-3)) C, and mater-stable aggregation were measured periodically during a 3-yr period after a single application of DPS at rates of 0 (control), 50, and 100 Mg ha(-1). Microscopic observations of water-stable aggregates were also performed. Adding DPS increased whole soil C content, which remained greater than in the control for the duration of the study. After 2 yr, about 40% of the initial material remained in the soil, The proportion of residual C attributed to DPS and present in the particulate fraction remained constant at 70 to 90% during the first 2 yr of the study, whereas the proportion of residual C present in the light fraction decreased from >95% for fresh DPS to <50% after 2 yr, One year after incorporation of DPS, the proportion of water-stable aggregates >1 mm was 2 to 6 times larger in amended soils than in the control. This effect was still statistically significant after 3 Sr. Microscopic observations revealed that DPS formed into clusters of wood fibers which became encrusted with mineral particles. We hypothesized that this encrustation provided physical protection to the decaying DPS which remained particulate (>53 pm) in size and progressively densified to >1.8 Mg m(-3). As a result, water-stable macroaggregates were formed with DPS as a central core.","Angers, DA; Beauchamp, CJ; Chantigny, MH",,63,1999,,,

Soil samples were collected from six long-term tillage comparison experiments located along two climatic gradients to examine the effects of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) management on bacterial and fungal abundance and biomass and to examine potential controls on the relative abundances of bacteria and fungi in these two systems. Samples were divided into 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth increments and analyzed for bacterial and fungal abundance and biomass, total C and N, particulate organic matter C and N (POM-C and N), soil water content, texture, pH, and water-stable aggregate distributions. Soil moisture, which varied by tillage treatment and geographically with climate, ranged from 0.05 to 0.35 g g(-1) dry soil in the surface 0-5 cm and 0.15 to 0.28 g g(-1) dry soil at 5-20 cm. Measured organic matter C and N fractions and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates were significantly higher in NT relative to CT at three of the six sites. Fungal hyphal length ranged from 19 to 292 m g(-1) soil and was 1.9 to 2.5 times higher in NT compared to CT surface soil across all sites. Few significant tillage treatment differences in soil physical and chemical properties or in fungal abundance and biomass were observed at 5-20 cm. Bacterial abundance and biomass were not consistently influenced by tillage treatment or site location at either depth. The proportion of the total biomass composed of fungi ranged from 10 to 60% and was significantly higher in NT compared to CT surface soil at five of six sites. Proportional fungal biomass was not strongly related to soil texture, pH, aggregation, or organic C and N fractions, but was positively related to soil moisture (r = 0.67; P < 0.001). The relationship between soil moisture and the degree of fungal dominance was due to the positive response of fungal biomass and the lack of response of bacterial biomass to increasing soil moisture across the range of measured soil water contents. Tillage treatment effects on fungal biomass and proportional fungal abundance were not significant when the data were analyzed by analysis of covariance with soil moisture as the covariate. These results suggest that observed tillage treatment and climate gradient effects on fungi are related to differences in soil moisture. Further research is needed, however, to determine how tillage-induced changes in the soil environment shape microbial community composition in agroecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Consequently, soil sustainability is paramount to assuring continued agricultural production. Soil structure and C storage can be influenced by producers' choices regarding residue and water management techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of alternative residue (i.e., tillage, residue burning, and fertility-residue level) and water management (irrigated and dryland) practices and soil depth after 10 yr of consistent management on total water-stable aggregate (TWSA; >0.25 mm) concentrations, size-separated aggregate concentrations, and corresponding C and N concentrations in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] double-crop production system in the lower Mississippi River Delta region of eastern Arkansas. The TWSA concentration was unaffected by residue burning and not always negatively impacted by conventional tillage (CT). The TWSA concentrations were 19% greater (P < 0.05) under CT than no-tillage (NT) within the dryland low-fertility-residue treatment combination. High-fertility-residue resulted in 18% less (P < 0.05) TWSA than under low-fertility-residue within the irrigated-NT treatment combination. Under high-fertility-residue, TWSA concentrations were 13% less (P < 0.05) in the 5- to 10-cm depth under irrigation and were 10% less (P < 0.05) in the top 5 cm under dryland management compared to the low-fertility-residue treatment. The smallest two size classes (0.25-0.5 and 0.5-1.0 mm) comprised over 80% of the TWSA. Water-stable aggregate concentrations in the largest two size classes (1-2 and >2 mm) were unaffected by all treatments imposed. Results of this study indicate that interactions between long-term residue and water management practices can significantly impact soil aggregate stability, and thus are useful for aiding the determination of long-term agricultural management practices that improve soil quality in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region.","Brye, Kristofor R.; Chen, Pengyin; Gbur, Edward E.; Korth, Kenneth; Smith, S.

Among the most notable changes were soil organic carbon (C) in the top 150 mm, which was about 30% less in cropping and pyrethrum paddocks than pasture paddocks, and microbial biomass C, which was about 60% less. Earthworm numbers showed even greater differences, with virtually no earthworms under pyrethrum. Pasture soils had higher shear strength and water contents at the liquid limit in the top 150 mm, and more water-stable aggregates in the subsurface soil. Despite these differences, the absolute values of most attributes in cropping paddocks were of a magnitude, which suggests that Tasmanian ferrosols even under continuous cropping are still in good condition. This agreed with the views of the farmers, obtained by individual survey. The decrease in organic C in the cropped soils has not decreased the effective cation exchange capacity, probably because their higher pH due to liming has compensated. Because ferrosols with organic C contents of 1-2% elsewhere in Australia have been shown to have serious management limitations, we need to know by how much the organic C contents in Tasmanian ferrosols will continue to decrease under intensive cropping to predict whether they might surer in a similar way.","Cooper, J; Cotching, WE; Rowley, W; Sparrow, LA",,37,1999,,,

The improvements were more pronounced with legume covers than with grass covers. Furthermore, the vegetative covers improved mean organic carbon level by 28% and appreciably improved mean CEC, Ca, and Mg levels over the values for the bare soils.

There were highly significant treatment effects (P = 0.01) for penetrometer resistance, pore size distribution, water infiltration, water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Grass and legume fallows which protect the soil and guarantee regular additions of organic materials are ecologically sound and socially acceptable components of sustainable agricultural production.

All the species responded well to organic management, which lowered the bulk density and particle density slightly and improved the water holding capacity (by 15%) of soil. Tuber quality was improved with significantly higher Ca (72.67 mg 100g(-1)), slightly higher dry matter, crude protein, K and Mg contents. Organic plots showed significantly higher available K, by 34% and pH, by 0.46 unit and higher soil organic matter by 14%. The dehydrogenase enzyme activity (1.174 mu g TPF formed g(-1) soil h(-1)), population of bacteria, fungi and P solubilizers were promoted by 14%, 23%, 17% and 22% respectively. Thus organic farming was found to be an eco-friendly management strategy in yams for sustainable yield of quality tubers besides maintaining soil health. Technology involving farmyard manure, green manuring, neem cake, biofertilizers and ash was standardized.","Sreekumar, J.; Suja, G.",,8,2014,,,

The long-term (15 years) impact of zero tillage in wheat under rice-wheat cropping system in semi-arid region of Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) was evaluated for physical properties, organic carbon build up, root growth and wheat productivity in different textured soils. The conventional (CT, two harrowing, one cultivator and planking) and zero tillage (ZT, direct drilling) systems were investigated. ZT increased soil organic carbon significantly to a depth of 0.10, 0.15 and 0.25 m in sandy loam, loam and clay loam soil, respectively, indicating its buildup to deeper depths with increase in fineness of soil texture. Carbon stock in surface 0.4 m soil depth increased by 19.0, 34.7 and 38.8% over CT in 15 years in sandy loam, loam and clay loam soil, respectively. The corresponding carbon sequestration rates were 0.24, 0.46 and 0.62 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). It reduced the plough pan, however, a significant increase in bulk density was observed in surface 0.05 m in sandy loam and 0.10 m in both loam and clay loam soils. Water dispersible silt + clay reduced indicating better soil aggregation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity increased significantly only to a depth of 0.10 m but with varying magnitudes. Increase in magnitude in surface 0.05 m layer was highest in loam (51%) followed by sandy loam (40%) and clay loam (38%) soil. Although ZT increased water retention and aeration porosity but increase in field water capacity was significant to a deeper depth (0.15 m) in clay loam soil. Water intake rate also increased significantly in clay loam soil (28%) over CT. The root biomass increased significantly and the highest increase was recorded in loam (81%) followed by sandy loam (70%) and clay loam (42%) soil. In addition, if encouraged roots to penetration deeper in the soils. In spite of improved soil physical properties and root growth under ZT, the significant increase in mass of grains and consequently the wheat yield, was observed only in clay loam soil indicating that the physical properties of other soils under CT have not reached to a stage limiting plant growth and yields. Study concludes that the ZT practice in wheat under rice-wheat system of semi-arid region of IGP in Haryana may be adopted for sustaining productivity of the system but the implementation of the practice must be promoted in fine textured soils.

Four practices including conventional tillage (CT), ridge farming tillage (RFT), no tillage (NT) and stubble mulch farming tillage (SMFT) were evaluated for 11 years (1990-1991 to 2001-2002) under semiarid rainfed conditions in western India on a very deep, sandy loam soil. Green gram(1) (Vigna radiata)-mustard (Brassica juncea) sequential cropping and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) + pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping systems were tested for the first four years (first phase of the experiment). Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)-mustard sequential cropping and cowpea + castor (Ricinus communis) intercropping systems were used for the following seven years (second phase of the experiment). Runoff, soil losses, sediment concentrations, crop yields, soil organic carbon, bulk density and water stable aggregates were observed for all the treatment combinations. RFT and SMFT were both effective in reducing runoff and soil loss. RFT, NT and SMFT reduced runoff by 69.4, 16.2 and 59.6% respectively compared with CT. Average soil loss in NT was 37.2% less than CT. Average sediment concentration of runoff during June-July was greater than in August-October for all treatments and average sediment concentrations were greater under CT and RFT. The highest average yield of all crops except green gram was recorded under SMFT. Surface soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density and water stable macro-aggregates were all significantly greater under NT at the end of the experiment, but reverting to uniform tillage negated this effect. Micro-aggregates built-up under SMFT were relatively more stable than those all under NT. The results of this study demonstrate that in the semi-arid sub-tropical agro-ecosystem of Gujarat (western India) adoption of SMFT can significantly improve and stabilise the crop yields and reverse land degradation process.

To improve soils and prevent degradation, understanding the effects of no-tillage management over time in changing water stable aggregates (WSA) and soil C is important. We investigated the changes in WSA and soil C at a site in Akame, Mie, Japan, operating a no-tillage with weed mulch management (NWM) system over a chronosequence from 0 to 17 years after conversion from conventional tillage practices (NWM for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 17 years). We measured weed aboveground biomass, litter accumulation, and root and earthworm density and biomass, and analyzed the WSA and C of bulk soil and each WSA size fraction. Weed aboveground biomass increased with site age, while litter accumulation, root biomass (soil depth of 0-4 cm), and earthworm density and biomass did not appear to be related to site age. Endogeic earthworm density and biomass tended to increase at year 5 of NWM compared to year 0. The WSA >2 mm and soil C stock in WSA of >2 mm increased over time under NWM at a soil depth of 0-15 cm, while the soil C stock of 0.25-1-mm WSA decreased at soil depths of 0-5 cm. The total soil C accumulation rate was 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at a soil depth of 0-25 cm over the NWM chronosequence. Therefore, our results indicated that by adopting NWM, C inputs to the soil from weed aboveground biomass, as well as increases in the WSA of >2 mm, might be responsible for soil C sequestration.

Effects of no-till and plow-till methods of seedbed preparation were compared at two levels of residue management (residue removed versus residue returned) and two levels of fertilizer application (without fertilizer versus recommended fertilizer). Soil chemical quality was better for no-till compared with plow-till methods. Mean soil chemical properties of 0-5 cm depth for no-till and plow-till treatments respectively were 18.6 g kg(-1) versus 12.2 g kg(-1) for soil organic carbon content, 1.9 g kg(-1) versus 1.1 g kg(-1) for total soil nitrogen, 0.14 units yr(-1) versus 0.18 units yr(-1) rate of decline in soil pH, 63.1 mg kg(-1) versus 31.8 mg kg(-1) for Bray-P, and 6 0 cmol kg(-1) Versus 2.3 cmol kg(-1) for Ca+2. Soil chemical quality consistently declined, although the rate of decline differed among tillage and fertilizer treatments. There were also differences in soil physical quality. Soil bulk density increased with cultivation duration in both tillage methods, and use of furadan in no-till plots drastically increased soil bulk density. Infiltration rate and soil moisture retention at all suctions was consistently more for no-till than plow-till treatments.

These services consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed using indicators, e.g. microbial biomass as an indicator of supporting services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil services - organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and retention) - in barley fields, leys and permanent pastures along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000 m radii). In addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were consistently lower than in permanent pastures. Leys supported greater microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However, landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH, suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing barley yield and the soil indicators. The results suggest that soil ES are determined at the field level, with little influence from the surrounding landscape, and that greater crop yields do not necessarily come at the expense of supporting soil services.

Continuous agricultural cultivation over a 7-yr period increased soil bulk density and soil pH and lowered water-holding capacity, organic C, total N, and N mineralization compared with soil in a forested site. Soil organic N fractions, including microbial biomass N and particulate organic matter N, were reduced by the mixing effects of tillage in the cultivated site. Initial clearing of vegetation increased hulk density and pH but did not decrease soil organic C and N compared with the forest site. Soil at an agricultural site that had been abandoned for an Il-Jr period did not return to levels of organic C, total N, and N mineralization observed in the forest and cleared sites. These results suggest that long-term tillage has a significant impact on soil properties in this tropical island environment, including reducing active and stable N pools.

The transport and leaching experiment results showed that a portion of the total soil water was available for transport processes while the remaining of the soil water was considered immobile and not readily accessible for solutes. The separation in water fractions of different mobilities was surprisingly consistent among OMW treatments. The bromide recovery rate decreased with the application of OMW showing that tracer molecules became trapped within immobile water phases. The application of OMW increased significantly the soil water-holding capacity, whereas the soil hydraulic conductivity in the near saturation range decreased significantly with long-term OMW application. The soil irrigated with OMW had significantly higher organic matter content, lower bulk density and relatively higher total porosity, but lower macroporosity than that of control sites. We concluded that the soil was increasingly coated with complex organic molecules originating from OMW, as a result, solute exchange between inter- and intrasoil aggregate water was hindered. Although OMW could cause soil and water pollution, its use in agriculture is promoted because of high nutrients and organic matter contents.","Janssen, M.; Lennartz, B.; Mahmoud, M.; Mohawesh, O.",,11,2014,,,

In this work, we studied the effect of olive oil mill wastewater (OOW) soil amendment on soil porosity and on leaching of the herbicides clopyralid (3,6-dichloropicolinic acid) and metamitron (4-amino-3-methyl-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one) in clay soil columns. OOW amendment resulted in an increase in the organic carbon content of the soils and a reduction in soil porosity, the latter confirmed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. MIP and SEM data showed the reduction in porosity is basically due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 0.1 mu m) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 0.1 mu m). These changes in porosity are produced by the combined effect of the suspended and soluble organic matter and salts in the OOW and the solubilization-insolubilization of the soil carbonate minerals promoted by OOW. Soil columns were handpacked with the unamended clay soil and with the same soil which had been treated for 3 yrs with two different doses of OOW (low dose: 300 ml/m(2) a year and high dose: 600 ml/m(2) a year). Clopyralid moved more rapidly than metamitron in the unamended soil due to greater sorption and degradation of metamitron. Total amounts of clopyralid leached from the OOW amended soils were significantly reduced (75 and 25% for the lower and higher dose, respectively) when compared with the unamended soil (100%), whereas metamitron did not leach at all from the amended soils. Sorption and degradation studies with soil slurry suggested this reduction may be mainly due to an increase in sorption and degradation processes in amended soils, as a consequence of the increase in the organic carbon content. However the decrease in mobility produced by OOW amendment is greater than that suggested from the sorption and degradation increases. The reduction in large size conducting pores and the increase in the small non-conducting pens, induced by OOW amendment, produce an increase in the residence time of the herbicides in the immobile water phase, enhancing diffusion, sorption and degradation processes, thereby retarding mobility. The retarding effect was more pronounced for metamitron than for clopyralid due to the higher sorptivity and degradability of the former herbicide. These results suggest the possible use of the OOW or similar wastewater amendment in reducing the contamination of groundwater by pesticide drainage.

The results showed that NTSC reduced soil bulk density in the 0-30 cm soil layer, but more importantly the treatment increased total porosity by 20.9%, water stable aggregates and pore size class distribution. The enhance soil structure and improved infiltration in NTSC treatments contributed to reducing soil salinity by 20.3%-73.4% when compared with CTSR. Soil organic matter was significantly greater to 30 cm in NTSC, while total soil nitrogen was lower than CTSR treatments; however, available P was significantly higher in the 0-5 cm soil surface. During the first 3 years, there was no difference in spring maize yield between NTSC and CTSR, but yield significantly increased in NTSC compared with CTSR during the remaining years due to reduced salinity stress and increased soil health.

An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18 differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland, Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63 were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84 to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs, they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils.

The research was conducted at the Sonora Agricultural Experiment Station on the Edwards Plateau, Texas. Infiltration rate and interrill erosion were measured using a drip-type rainfall simulator. Terminal infiltration rates of unburned areas were significantly greater on sites dominated by oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.) (200 mm hour(-1)) or juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchh.) (183 mm hour(-1)) than on sites dominated by bunchgrass (146 mm hour(-1)) or shortgrass (105 mm hour(-1)). Terminal infiltration rates on burned areas were significantly reduced on sites dominated by bunchgrass (110 mm hour(-1)), shortgrass (76 mm hour(-1)), and on oak sites that were cut and burned (129 mm hour(-1)). Soil organic matter content (r = .61), total organic cover (r = .59), and aggregate stability (r = .53) were the variables most strongly correlated with infiltration rate. Measured soil structure properties were not altered by fire, therefore, differences in infiltration rate between unburned and burned treatments were attributable to variations in the amount of cover. The terminal infiltration rate of cut and burned juniper sites (162 mm hour(-1)) was not changed significantly after the fire because the associated good soil structure properties allowed rapid infiltration even after cover was removed. Good soil structure properties were also present on the oak sites, but the infiltration rate significantly decreased as a result of the temporary hydrophobic nature of the soil on this site after burning. Prior to burning, interrill erosion was much lower under the tree sites (oak = 2 kg ha(-1); juniper = 34 kg ha(-1)) than on bunchgrass (300 kg ha(-1)) or shortgrass (1,299 kg ha(-1) sites. After burning, interrill erosion significantly increased for all vegetation types (shortgrass = 5,766 kg ha(-1); bunchgrass = 4,463 kg ha(-1); oak = 4,500 kg ha(-1); juniper = 1,926 kg ha(-1)). Total organic cover (r = -.74) and bulk density at 0-30 mm (r = .46) were most strongly correlated with interrill erosion.","Hester, JW; Taylor, CA; Thurow, TL",,50,1997,,,

Although many comparative studies involving these two agricultural systems have been undertaken, few assess the impact of these two fundamentally differing systems on soil structure, and none on soil microstructure. In this study, two adjacent, paired farms in eastern Iowa, one managed according to organic, and the other according to conventional, farming methods, were studied to determine the effects of these two agricultural systems on soil structure and microstructure. At both farms colour, texture, ped type and degree of development, depth of the A horizon and porosity were described in the field, organic matter content was determined, and microstructural and organic characteristics were described using micromorphology. The organic farm had a significantly ameliorated soil structure: with an increased A horizon depth, organic matter content, porosity, earthworm abundance and activity, and coarser, better developed aggregates than the conventional farm. Moreover, the conventional farm also suffered from compaction and erosion. This study indicates that, over the long-term, organic management methods are able to maintain and improve the structure of the soil, resulting in a soil with tilth more conducive to promoting crop growth, than conventional methods which degrade the soil.","Gerhardt, RA",,14,1997,,,

For this, an experiment managed with direct sowing (no tillage) is being conducted since 2002, in Eldorado do Sul, RS, in an Ultisol that initially was degraded naturally with a high degree of compaction. Treatments consisted of three soil cover crops in winter (fallow, oat + vetch and forage radish), two depths (0.12 and 0.21 m) of operation of the shank of fertilizer and seed drill and three traffic conditions (tractor movements, harvester and no traffic). In summer corn and soybeans are sown in annual rotation. There was an increase in the levels of soil organic matter and of its fractions, which resulted in reduced values of density and increased macroporosity and total porosity of soil. Soil bulk density was lower in soil condition not without agricultural machinery traffic. The conversion of naturally degraded field into a system of grain production using integrated management alternatives with no tillage system restores the physical quality of soil to carry out appropriately its functions.","Levien, Renato; Mazurana, Michael; Mueller, Jonatan; Sequinatto, Leticia; Trein, Carlos R.",,18,2014,,,

The experiment consisted of seven treatments [i. flat bed farmer's practice (FP) no residue; ii. broad beds and furrows (BBF) with residue incorporation; iii. BBF with residue + hedge leaves (Tephrosia sp) incorporation; iv. BBF with residue + hedge leaves (no tillage, NT); v. raised bed (RB) with residue incorporation; vi. RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation; vii. RB with residue + hedge leaves (NT)] laid out in randomised block design and replicated thrice. The conservation treatments were found to significantly improve biological activity and chemical properties of soil. However, physical properties such as texture and bulk density were not significantly affected by any of the treatments. Infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity were 108% and 46% higher, respectively, in the treatments under RB with residue + hedge leaves (NT) as compared to FP. Soil microbial biomass carbon was 67% higher under RB with residue + hedge leaves incorporation than FP after the harvest of both the crops in the second year while dehydrogenase activity was 135% higher in RB with residue + hedge leaves (NT) after the harvest of groundnut and RB with residue incorporation after the harvest of toria than FP, respectively. System productivity under RBs were significantly higher than that recorded under BBF and FB. Conservation treatments showed better soil health at the end of the cropping cycles and it is concluded that raised beds along with residue management can provide an alternative and sustainable technology contributing to sustainable agriculture in the NEHR of India which can be extrapolated to other similar areas..","Das, Anup; Kuotsu, Kevizhalhou; Munda, G.

Soil physical and hydrological properties,"Assessments of the effects of deforestation, post-clearance tillage methods and farming systems treatments on soil properties were made from 1978 through 1987 on agricultural watersheds near Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. These experiments were conducted in two phases: Phase I from 1978 through 1981 and Phase II from 1983 to 1987, with 1 year (1982) as a transition phase when all plots were sown with mucuna (Mucuna utilis). There were six treatments in Phase I involving combinations of land clearing and tillage methods: (1) manual clearing with no-till (MC-NT); (2) manual clearing with plough-till (MC-PT); (3) shear-blade clearing with no-till (SB-NT); (4) tree-pusher/root rake clearing with no-till (TP-NT); (5) tree-pusher/root-rake clearing with plough-till (TP-PT); (6) traditional farming (TF). The six treatments were replicated twice in a completely randomized design. The traditional treatment of Phase I was discontinued during Phase II. The five farming systems studied during Phase II with a no-till system in all treatments were: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m intervals; (2) and (3) fallowing with Mucuna utilis on severely degraded and moderately degraded watersheds, respectively, for 1 year followed by maize-cowpea rotation for another; (4) and (5) ley farming involving establishment of pasture in the first year on severely and moderately degraded plots, respectively, controlled grazing in the second year, and growing maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in the third year. All treatments, imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, were replicated twice. The soil properties analyzed were particle size distribution, total aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates, soil bulk density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics, infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. These properties were measured under the forest cover in 1978, and once every year during the dry season thereafter during Phases I and II. Prior to deforestation, mean soil bulk density was 0.72 Mg m(-3) and 1.30 Mg m(-3), soil penetration resistance was 32.4 KPa and 90.7 KPa, and mean weight diameter of aggregates was 3.7 mm and 3.2 mm for 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths, respectively. The infiltration rate was excessive (54-334 cm hr(-1)) and saturated hydraulic conductivity was rapid (166-499 cm hr(-1)) under the forest cover. Furthermore, water transmission properties varied significantly even over short distances of about 1 m. Deforestation and cultivation increased soil bulk density and penetration resistance but decreased mean weight diameter of aggregates. One year after deforestation in 1980, mean soil bulk density was 1.41 Mg m(-3) for 0-5 cm depth and 1.58 Mg m(-3) for 5-10 cm depth. Soil bulk density and penetration resistance were generally higher for NT than for PT methods, and the penetration resistance was extremely high in all treatments by 1985. During Phase II, soil bulk density was high during the grazing cycle of the ley farming treatment. Sand content at 0-5 cm depth increased and clay content decreased with cultivation duration. Soon after deforestation, saturated hydraulic conductivity and equilibrium infiltration rate in cleared and cultivated land declined to only 20-30 per cent of that under forest. Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity following deforestation was 46.0 cm hr(-1) for 0-5 cm depth and 53. 7 cm hr(-1) for 5-10 cm depth. Further, infiltration rate declined with deforestation and cultivation duration in all cropping systems treatments. During Phase I, mean infiltration rate was 115. 8 cm hr(-1) under forest cover in 1978, 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1979, 17.4 cm hr(-1) in 1980 and 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1981. During Phase II, mean infiltration rate was 8.5 cm hr(-1) in 1982, 11.9 cm hr(-1) in 1983, 11.0 cm hr(-1) in 1984, 11.3 cm hr(-1) in 1985 and 5.3 cm hr(-1) in 1986. Infiltration rate was generally high in ley farming and mucuna fallowing treatments. Natural fallowing drastically improved the infiltration rate from 19.2 cm hr(-1) in 1982 to 193.2 cm hr(-1) in 1986, a ten-fold increase within 5 years of fallowing. High-energy soil water retention characteristics in Phase I were affected by those treatments that caused soil compaction by mechanized clearing and no-till systems. Soil water retention at 0.01 MPa potential in 1979 was 19.2 per cent (gravimetrics) for SE, 17.9 per cent for TP, 15.9 per cent for MC and 17.8 per cent for TF methods. With regards to tillage, soil water retention was 17.8 per cent for NT compared with 16.8 per cent for PT. During Phase II, water retention characteristics were not affected by the farming system treatments. Mean soil water retention (average of 4 years' data from 1982 to 1986) at 0.01 MPa for 0-5 cm depth was 16.6 per cent for alley cropping, 16.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing and 16.8 per cent for ley farming. Mean soil water retention for 1.5 MPa suction was 9.3 per cent for alley cropping, 8.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing, and 9.3 per cent for ley farming. Water retention at 1.5 MPa suction correlated with the clay and soil organic carbon content.","Lal, R",,7,1996,,,

Changes in and responses of soil physico-chemical properties and soil quality to land-use change was investigated along a chronosequence of farm fields on a Ferric Lixisol in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Soil bulk density increased significantly only in the top 0-10 cm soil layer. Concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N decreased significantly in the top 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil depths. By 30 years after forest conversion, cocoa system had re-accumulated up to 38.8 Mg C ha(-1) or 85 % of initial forest carbon stock values. Total porosity (%) decreased significantly in shaded-cocoa fields in comparison with the natural semi-deciduous forest. An assessment of soil deterioration using degradation indices (DIs) revealed that total soil quality (0-20 cm) deteriorated significantly (DI = -60.6) in 3-year-old of cocoa system but improved in 15 and 30-year-old systems. Available P stocks declined consistently while soil exchangeable Ca, K and Mg stocks as well as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation remained more or less stable with a tendency to improve. The inclusion of leguminous shade trees during early plantation development, development of mechanisms for the integration of cover crops and enhancement of farmer capability in improved farm management are required to maintain high C and nutrient base, minimize soil quality degradation during plantation development phase and sustain long-term productivity.","Dawoe, Evans K.; Oppong, Samuel K.; Quashie-Sam, James S.",,88,2014,,,

The content of total P, organic P and microbial biomass P (P-mic) decreased in the aggregate size order < 0.1, 1-2, and 0.1-1.0 mm respectively. In contrast available P (extracted by Bray I reagent) was lowest in the < 0.1 mm aggregate size. Cultivation decreased the percentage of 1-2 mm aggregates but increased that of the < 0.1 mm aggregates. Fertilization increased markedly both total P and organic P in the < 0.1 mm fraction of arable soils compared to the corresponding samples from unfertilized grassland soils. During aggregate separation, most of P loss was in the form of particulate P and less than 1% in solution. More organic P and P-mic were lost from the grassland soils than from the arable soils.","CAMPBELL, CO; CHAPMAN, SJ; EDWARDS, AC; HE, ZL; WILSON, MJ",,83,1995,,,

This study evaluated the effects of incorporation of plant residue and chemical fertilizer under reduced tillage on biomass and grain yield of dryland (rainfed) rice (Oryza sativa L.). Four treatments were established: (a) a no-input control; (b) chemical fertilizer 80 kg N ha(-1), 40 kg P ha(-1), and 30 kg K ha(-1); (c) air-dried wheat straw (organic C 378 g kg(-1), total N 4.8 g kg(-1), total P 0.9 g kg(-1), C/N ratio 75.5) at 20 Mg ha(-1) (the amount of N in straw was equivalent to that applied with chemical fertilizer); (d) wheat straw + fertilizer, straw applied at 10 Mg ha(-1) and rate of fertilizer 50% of (b). The soil type at the site is a Inceptisol and, a silt loam, pH 6.7 and water holding capacity 405 g kg(-1). Straw and fertilizer treatments were applied about 3 weeks before planting. Inorganic N (nitrate+ammonium-N) concentrations in the control, fertilizer, straw, and straw+fertilizer amended soils were 7.2, 11.6, 8.6 and 11.5 mu g g(-1), respectively. Available P was greatest in the straw+fertilizer treated plots (16.7 mu g g(-1)) followed by fertilizer (16.0 mu g g(-1)), straw (14.2 mu g g(-1)) and the control (12.0 pg g(-1)). The rates of N-mineralization in the straw C fertilizer, fertilizer and straw treatments were 16.6, 14.3 and 11.2 pg g(-1) month(-1), respectively. Microbial biomass C, N and P were 66, 77 and 49% greater, respectively, in the straw+fertilizer treated plots than in the control.

During a wet period, fruit cracking and evidence of water-mold root rot were significantly higher in the ICM system than the BLD and CON systems. Defoliation by Alternaria solani was greatest in the BLD system and least in the ICM system. The BLD and ICM systems resulted in a 1 week earlier peak yield compared to the CON system. The yield of No. 1 fruit was 55% to 60% greater in the BLD+ system than the other three systems, which were comparable in yield.

Tillage and subsurface drainage influences these pools; however, the effect of these systems on poorly drained soils may be different. Therefore, the present study was conducted on a field experiment, established at the Waterman Farm of the Ohio State University in 1994. Specific objectives of the study are to assess the influence of no-tillage (NT), chisel tillage (CT) with drainage (TD) and non-drainage (ND) management under a continuous corn (Zea mays L.) system on SOC, C fractions (heavy and light), and water stable aggregates (WSA). Data from this study showed that the SOC stock for the NT was 25, 37 and 32% higher for the 0-10, 10-20 and 40-60cm depths, respectively, as compared to that under CT system. Tillage significantly influenced the light fraction (LF) and heavy fraction (HF) of carbon. The NT system increased LF and HF by 10 and 12%, respectively, compared to CT for the 0-10cm depth. Eighteen years of NT management decreased soil bulk density and improved macroaggregates and mean weight diameter compared to that under CT system. Drainage impacts on soil parameters were negligible, and may be partially due to the reason that the corn-corn cropping system may not have sufficiently improved the soil properties between the two tillage systems. In general, drainage improved porosity and the corn yield. It can be concluded that NT with subsurface management improves SOC dynamics and promotes aggregation and corn yield as compared to that with CT system.","Chintala, R.; Fausey, N.; Gautam, S.; Kadono, A.; Kumar, S.; Lal, R.; Mbonimpa, E.

These changes might hamper the development of plants in soil management practices that involve its mobilization, and the negative effects might be increased due to intensive use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physico-hydrical properties of a Haplohumox in integrated production systems under different soil managements. The soil superficial (0.0-0.10 m) and subsuperficial (0.10-0.20 m) layers were evaluated in the different systems: conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), no-tillage (NT) and chiseled no-tillage (CNT), taking into consideration the annual ryegrass cropped for different uses [cover crop (C), grazing (G) and silage (S)] during the winter. Soil bulk density (Db), total porosity (TP), macro (Ma) and microporosity (Mi), water retention curves (SWRC) and water retention due to pore size (r) were determined. The annual ryegrass used as C produced lower Db and Mi and higher TP and Ma in CT, MT and CNT systems. No difference was verified between G and S in any of the management systems or soil layers. The superficial layer SWRC presented similar behavior regarding CT, MT and CNT. Under NT, C resulted in higher water retention. However, G and S provided higher water retention due to the pore size in this system.","Auler, Andre Carlos; Barth, Gabriel; Miara, Simone; Pires, Luiz Fernando; da Fonseca, Adriel Ferreira",,45,2014,,,

On the Pampa, loam soils under no-till sometimes have lower infiltration rates than those conventionally tilled; this is due to the occurrence of platy and massive structures. In this study, we aimed to identify the soil management practices that promote platy structure formation, and explain the soil physical behaviour linked to the thickness of platy structures in relation to infiltration rate, bulk density and shear strength. Six fields with different numbers of years under agriculture and diverse previous crops (maize or wheat-soybean double crop) were sampled, distinguishing within each field headlands (areas with higher traffic) and centre (lower traffic). Twenty samples were taken at random along a 200-m transect to characterise soil structure (platy, granular or massive) and the thickness of the platy structure. Principal component analysis revealed linkages between previous crop and location in each field and type of structure. ANOVA showed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction of previous crop x location. The frequency and thickness of the platy structures were lower, and those of granular structures higher, under wheat-soybean double cropping and in the centre of the field. Greater thickness of the platy structure determined lower water infiltration rate (r = -0.337; P < 0.01) and greater soil shear strength (r = 0.297, P < 0.01). Micromorphological analysis indicated the dominance of massive and platy structure in the headlands and bioturbation in the centre of the fields with wheat-soybean double cropping. These results suggest bioturbation, crop-root binding and low machinery traffic as the main factors minimising soil evolution towards unfavourable structural types under no-till farming in the area.","Alvarez, C.

During the study microbial biomass C ranged from 144 to 491 mug g-1 dry soil, biomass N from 14.6 to 50.1 mug g-1, and biomass P from 7.2 to 17.6 mug g-1 soil. Microbial biomass C, N and P represented 3.2-4.6% of total C, 2.6-3.8% of total N, and 5.8-8.2% of total P in the soil, respectively, in all cases the highest proportion occurred in the straw+fertilizer treatment and the lowest in the control. Microbial biomass C, N, and P were positively correlated with each other. Microbial biomass C and N increased by 77% in straw+fertilizer-treated plots relative to the control. The increase in microbial biomass P in the straw+fertilizer treatment over the control was 81%. The increase in the microbial biomass is expected to enhance nutrient availability in the soil, as the microbial biomass acts both as a sink and a source of plant nutrients.","SINGH, H; SINGH, KP",,16,1993,,,

Manure amendments and green manures are management practices that can increase some nutrient contents and improve soil aggregation. We investigated the effects of 28 yr of winter planted green manure on soil aggregate-size distribution and aggregate-associated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The study was a randomized completed block design with three replicates. The treatments included rice-rice-fallow, rice-rice-rape, rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch and rice-rice-ryegrass. The experiment was established in 1982 on a silty light clayey paddy soil derived from Quaternary red clay (classified as Fe-Accumuli-Stagnic Anthrosols) with continuous early and late rice. In 2009, soil samples were collected (0-15 cm depth) from the field treatment plots and separated into water-stable aggregates of different sizes (i.e., >5, 2-5, 1-2, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5 and <0.25 mm) by wet sieving. The long-term winter planted green manure significantly increased total C and N, and the formation of the 2-5-mm water-stable aggregate fraction. Compared with rice-rice-rape, rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch and rice-rice-ryegrass, the rice-rice-fallow significantly reduced 2-5-mm water-stable aggregates, with a significant redistribution of aggregates into micro-aggregates. Long-term winter planted green manure obviously improved C/N ratio and macro-aggregate-associated C and N. The highest contribution to soil fertility was from macro-aggregates of 2-5 mm in most cases.","Jian, Xie; Jun, Nie; Sheng-xian, Zheng; Yu-lin, Liao; Zeng-ping, Yang",,13,2014,,,

Farmyard manure (FYM) and mulch applications, which affect soil characteristics and plant significantly, are regard as an effective pattern of saline land improvement. As a conventional management in the study region, FYM and mulch are used for the amendment of the new reclaimed tidal flat regularly, but little is known about their effects on soil physical properties functioning. A study was conducted on a typical coastal tidal flat saline land, which was reclaimed in 2005, to evaluate the effects of FYM, polyethylene film mulch (PM), straw mulch (SM), FYM combined with PM (FYM+PM), FYM combined with SM (FYM+SM), on soil hydraulic properties and soil mechanical impedance. CK represented conventional cultivation in study area without FYM and mulch application and served as a control. The experiment, laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications, was studied in Huanghaiyuan Farm, which specialized in the agricultural utilization for coastal tidal flat. Result showed that capillary water holding capacity (CHC), saturated water content (SWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and bulk density (BD), cone index (CI) were affected significantly by the FYM and mulch application, especially in the 0-10 cm soil layer. FYM and mulch management increased CRC, SWC and K-s over all soil depth in the order of FYM+SM>FYM+PM>FYM>SM>PM>CKs With the contrary sequence, BD and CI decreased significantly; however, FYM and mulch application affected BD and CI only in the upper soil layers. CRC, SWC and K-s, decreased significantly with the increasing of soil depth, BD and CI, and a significant liner equation was found between CHC, SWC, K-s and BD, CI. With the highest CHC (38.15%), SWC (39.55%), K-s, (6.00 mm h(-1) ) and the lowest BD (1.26 g cm(-3)) and CI (2.71 MPa), the combined management of FYM and SM was recommend to be an effective method for the melioration of reclaimed coastal tidal flat saline soil.","Fu-rong, Li; Jian-bing, Zhang; Jing-song, Yang; Rong-jiang, Yao; Shi-peng, Yu; Xiao-jing, Hou",,13,2014,,,

The studies were carried out employing different crop rotations, where the plant sequence was laid out in four treatments so that the plant residues in the soil would accumulate more organic matter and nitrogen. Research evidence showed that different farming systems and plant sequences in rotations did not affect soil acidity, but significantly increased the contents of total nitrogen and organic carbon and reduced the contents of available phosphorus and potassium. Soil physical properties changed accordingly. Higher moisture levels were determined in soil under extensive and conventional-chemical farming systems. At the lower soil layers the impact of green manure on the reduction of soil bulk density and increase of total and air-filled porosity was evident. Extensive and conventional-chemical farming systems favoured the distribution of fungi in the soil.

These factors have not been quantified in the drier (450-550mm), marginal cropping areas to the west. With widespread adoption of zero tillage technology and the potential for large increases in the capture and storage of rainfall in good seasons, mobilisation of salt could be exacerbated should crop water use be constrained by salt toxicity and/or nutrient deficiency. We investigated the size of salt stocks, historic deep drainage, and nutrient depletion under continuous cropping in the Grey and Brown Vertosols of the Walgett and Coonamble districts of north-western NSW. Soils collected from seven paired sites (cropped v. control native vegetation) showed chloride concentrations >500mg/kg within 0-1.2m, high exchangeable sodium percentage (similar to 30%) at depth and deficiency in phosphorus, manganese and zinc. Soil total nitrogen decreased from an average stock of 4.9t/ha at a rate of 0.008t/ha.year under cropping within 0-0.1m and soil carbon stocks decreased from 39t/ha by 0.20t/ha.year within 0-0.5m.. Despite low rainfall, high evaporation and the large water-holding capacity of the cracking clays, there were significant downward shifts in chloride concentrations under cropping. Estimates of deep drainage under continuous cropping using chloride mass balance, chloride-front displacement and crop water-balance modelling with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) generally agreed (range 0.1-2% of average annual rainfall). Simulations suggested that deep drainage may be increased 5-10-fold under zero-tillage winter cropping due to enhanced capture of rainfall by zero tillage compared with traditional practices. The associated flushing of salt from the root-zone together with correction of nutrient deficiency would enhance crop water use and productivity. Current methods indicate little storage in the subsoil for future deep drainage and that hydraulic conductivity is very low. Hence, the long-term effects of any increase in drainage rates, due to changes in cropping practices and/or climate, on the potential for salinisation of groundwater or transient water logging of the surface, are equivocal.","Harden, Steven; Huth, Neil; McLeod, Ross; Young, Rick",,52,2014,,,

Soil health is a key factor in crop production and the new emphasis on sustainable agriculture has generated interest in the optimization of all aspects of soil functioning - physical, chemical and biological. The objective of this study was to use a set of soil health indicators to measure the effects of farm manure (FM) application and cropping pattern on Pakistan soils. For this study five cropping systems, i.e. cotton-wheat (CW), maize-wheat (MW), rice-wheat (RW), sugarcane-wheat (SW) and vegetable-vegetable (V-V), both, manured and non-manured were selected from each cropping zones of Pakistan. Samples collected were analyzed for soil health indicators including soil bulk density, available water capacity (AWC), aggregate stability (WSA), macro porosity, organic matter (OM), soil active carbon (ActC), potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), P, K, Zn, Ca, S, CEC and pH. Manured plots had significantly higher levels of OM (28%), ActC (43%), PMN (92%), AWC (24%), and macro porosity (19%) and significantly lower bulk density (5%) than non-manured plots. Among cropping systems highest values were found in SW, MW and SW compared to RW, with higher values in the former systems for WSA (243%), AWC (16%) and macro-porosity (39%). This clearly gave indication of the deteriorative effect of puddling in rice cultivation. Higher values were observed in MW, RW, CW with higher OM (36%), active carbon (ActC, 33.6%) and PMN (731%) compared to CW and VV. Only S and Mg were significantly higher in manured plots while pH, CEC, NO3-N, P, K, Zn and Ca were statistically not different in manured fields.

Chemical, Mechanical, and Biological Properties","Optimal use of management systems including tillage and winter cover crops is recommended to improve soil quality and sustain agricultural production. The effects on soil properties of three tillage systems (as main plot) including direct drilling (D), harrowing to a depth of 8 to 10 cm (H), and moldboard plowing (MP) with and without a cover crop were evaluated in a long-term experiment on a sandy loam soil in Denmark. Chemical, physical, and biological soil properties were measured in the spring of 2012. The field measurements included mean weight diameter (MWD) after the drop-shatter test, penetration resistance, and visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS). In the laboratory, aggregate strength, water-stable aggregates (WSA), and clay dispersibility were measured. The analyzed chemical and biological properties included soil organic C (SOC), total N, microbial biomass C, labile P and K, and pH. Reduced tillage (D and H) resulted in a stratification of the chemical properties within the 0- to 20-cm topsoil layer but a uniform distribution for MP. There was an accumulation of SOC, total N, and labile P and K and reduced pH in the 0- to 10-cm layer. Reduced tillage increased soil strength in terms of greater MWD, VESS, WSA, aggregate tensile strength, and rupture energy. Five years of using a cover crop alleviated plow pan compaction at the 20- to 40-cm depth by reducing penetration resistance. A significant interaction between tillage and cover crop treatments indicated the potential benefit of using a combination of cover crops and direct drilling to produce a better soil friability. The usefulness of the VESS method for soil structural evaluation was supported by the high positive correlation of MWD with VESS scores.","Abdollahi, Lotfollah; Munkholm, Lars J.",,78,2014,,,

Understanding the ecological impacts of agricultural legacies, which may last for decades to millennia following agricultural abandonment, is critical for interpreting contemporary patterns of biodiversity and for informing strategies for the restoration of post-agricultural ecosystems. However, the study of agricultural legacies is complicated by non-random land-use decisions: areas selected for agriculture commonly differ from non-agricultural areas in ways that may confound interpretation of agricultural legacies (e.g., agricultural areas may have more productive soils). We evaluated legacies of tillage agriculture in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands of the Southeastern United States, using a paired-plot study design (n = 29 paired remnant and post-agricultural woodlands) to minimize the confounding influence of non-random past land-use decisions. Agricultural legacies were prevalent, but not due to differences in the types of sites selected for agriculture. Nearly 60 years after agricultural abandonment and afforestation, numerous soil attributes (i.e., N, P, organic matter, soil water holding capacity) remain altered in post-agricultural woodlands, relative to adjacent remnants. Overstory tree abundance and understory plant species richness were similar in remnant and post-agricultural woodlands, but we found a pronounced agricultural legacy on over- and understory plant community composition. Understory compositional differences were striking, particularly given the proximity of post-agricultural woodlands to immediately adjacent remnant source populations and the time (>50 years) for source populations to spread. This difference in understory community composition could be caused by the persistent environmental differences we observed or by dispersal limitation, as evidenced by greater species richness in post-agricultural sites with greater historical landscape connectivity. We suggest that future experimental work will further assist in a mechanistic understanding of how agricultural legacies impede understory plant recovery and that this understanding will benefit the formulation of strategies for the restoration of post-agricultural longleaf pine woodlands and other forested systems.

Burnt and unburnt soils were cropped with maize, melon, and cowpea (in sole and intercrops).

Organic matter, water-stable aggregates, pH, cation exchange capacity, macroporosity, and water infiltration were reduced after burning in both sites. Active carbon and potentially mineralizable nitrogen increased after burning at Ibadan but decreased after burning at Akure. Soil quality decreased after burning by a range of 11.3-24.8% using SMAF and MVIT, respectively, although only MVIT showed significant differences (p0.05). Test crops increased in yields on burnt soils due to prompt release of nutrients to the crops; the benefit was dwarfed by the adverse effects of burning on soil quality indices.","Adelana, Ayodele Olumide; Adeyolanu, Olateju Dolapo; Are, Kayode Steven; Ayoola, Olukemi Titilola; Oluwatosin, Gabriel Akinboye",,59,2013,,,

When repeated for a long period, no-tillage has significantly increased soil compaction compared to the conventional tilled soil. Soil compaction was likely responsible for creating a selective environment for active bacterial species. On the other hand, tillage favoured the richness and diversity of active soil bacteria by increasing the rate of diffusion of 02 and the energy sources availability. A wide variability of active nirK denitrifiers was found in each soil management, while nirS denitrifiers were more closely related to lower porosity conditions. N fertilizer management seemed to affect mainly the active nosZ denitrifiers. Our results suggested that conservation tillage practices on heavy clayish soils are not free of relevant side effects on soil porosity and bacterial soil communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This phenomenon is associated with the covering soil particles and hydrophobic organic compounds reducing the soil sorptivity and hence infiltration of water. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of hydrophobicity in the soil and assess its relationship with resistance and size distribution of water stable aggregates, particle size distribution and organic matter content of different soils in southern Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in different soil layers, 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm, to determine soil sorptivity, geometric mean diameter and aggregate stability index while granulometric composition and organic matter content were determined using disturbed soil samples. The sorptivity test was conducted using a tension micro-infiltrometer, with two different liquids, distilled water and ethanol (95% v/v). The proportions of sand, silt and clay did not correlate significantly with the occurrence of hydrophobicity. In the hydrophobic soils, hydrophobicity index is directly associated with high organic matter contents and did not correlate with the particle size distribution. For the hydrophobic aggregates, cohesive forces between the particles acted for long period as a result of slow wetting, which led to an increase in geometric mean diameter, stability index of water stable aggregates and consequently greater resistance to the disintegrating actions of associated agents.

The cessation of cultivation allows the potential recovery of soil aggregate binding agents such as soil micro-organisms and biochemical properties. Consequently, an increase in soil aggregate stability is expected. However, this outcome is difficult to predict because the response of each individual soil component and its contribution to soil stability varies. This study utilized a chronosequence of 12 ex-arable fields in the Bolivian Altiplano, representing six soil ages of abandonment after cessation of potato cultivation, to examine whether soil aggregate stability increases after abandonment and the extent to which changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition and soil chemical properties are involved in stability recovery. Fields with the longest time since disturbance (15 and 20 years) have a greater proportion of water-stable aggregates than more recently abandoned fields (1 and 3 years) and exhibit larger differences in bacterial and fungal composition. Total N, NH4+, C and organic matter also increased with time since the last intensive agricultural practice. Water-stable aggregates were strongly correlated with soil fungal community composition. Analysis of covariance is also consistent with the soil fungal community being an important mediator of the recovery of aggregate stability. Synthesis and applications. Soil aggregate stability increased by 50% over the 20 years following disturbance. This recovery was associated with shifts in soil fungal community composition, as is consistent with fungal mediation of this recovery. Land management strategies focusing on restoration of the soil fungal community may enhance soil aggregate stability, a key aspect for soil conservation, restoration, sustainability of agroecosystems and erosion prevention.","Bever, James D.; Bontti, Eliana; Duchicela, Jessica; Sullivan, Tarah S.",,50,2013,,,

The results showed that the five properties evaluated can be included in soil quality assessments and are not influenced by the clay and iron oxide contents.

Soil samples collected in 1997 (baseline) and 2010 were fractionated into four water stable aggregate-size classes: macroaggregate (>250 mu m), microaggregate (53-250 mu m), and silt + clay (<53 mu m), and three intra-aggregate size classes: particulate organic matter (>250 mu m), microaggregates (53-250 mu m), and silt + clay (<53 mu m). Reduced tillage and increased vegetation inputs under WW-B. Dahl Old World bluestem [Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz) S.T.

A continued increase in SOC was measured in the ICL following 13 yr with 22% more SOC relative to CTN. The results from the detailed soil aggregate C fractionation revealed that an ICL under limited irrigation enhanced SOC stored in protected, recalcitrant aggregate pools (intra-aggregate microaggregate SOC of 8.2 and 5.4 mg g(-1) macroaggregate in the ICL and CTN, respectively). These benefits impart important ecosystem services such as potential C sequestration and reduced erosion potential, which are especially important in these semiarid soils.","Acosta-Martinez, Veronica; Allen, Vivien G.; Fultz, Lisa M.; Moore-Kucera, Jennifer; Zobeck, Ted M.",,77,2013,,,

A field trial was conducted at two former fast growing poplar plantations and one willow plantation in northern Germany to study the effects of different tillage depths and land use systems during such a re-conversion of the plantations on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Re-conversion was performed at tillage depths of 5, 15 and 30 cm and rye-grass and maize cropping, were established. Directly after re-conversion and again one year after re-conversion, bulk soil C, distribution of C within various soil fractions (microbial biomass, water-stable aggregates, free and occluded light fraction organic matter) and C amounts added with coarse harvest residues were determined at 0-30 cm soil depths. After re-conversion, the amount of C stored in the harvest residues was 17-39 t C ha(-1). One year after re-conversion, it had declined distinctly but rarely significantly, due to the high spatial variability of the harvest residues in the field. Nevertheless, C of the bulk soil did not change, but a decrease of microbial biomass C, macroaggregate (250-2000 mu m) C and free light fraction organic matter indicate a loss of important fractions of soil organic C. More C was found in macroaggregates under rye-grass than under maize one year after re-conversion in loamy soils.

Currently, some of these pastures are being replaced by plantations of sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth). The objective was to analyze the effect of these changes on the soil physical and chemical properties and root development. The experiment was conducted in Areia-PB, in a dystrophic Ultisol. The three treatments were represented by three land uses: secondary native forest, sabia plantation, and brachiaria pasture grass (Brachiaria decumbens). Soil samples were collected from three slope positions: top, middle, and bottom. For physical properties and root studies, in each position soil was collected at three different points and in four depths (0.0-2.5, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-10.0, and 10.0-20.0 cm). Composite samples were made to assess the chemical properties and clay content. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with repeated measures in space. The results showed better aggregation, density, and porosity in the area of native secondary forest. The replacement of pasture by sabia lead to a decrease in the aggregation but did not affect bulk density or soil's total porosity. Nutrient levels were higher in the sabia area, although statistically different just for K and saturation of exchangeable bases. Changes in land use invariably degrade soil physical and chemical properties, but when a less aggressive system is introduced, changes are hardly detectable in the short term.","Borchartt, Lucas; Ferreira, Leonardo Elias; Pereira, Walter Esfrain; Silva, Antonio Sousa; Souza, Mayara Andrade; da Silva, Ivandro de Franca",,37,2013,,,

The field plots were treated with traditional deep tillage, minimum tillage, green manuring, mature compost, and iron-porphyrin as a biomimetic catalyst. Although the original soil texture exerted a strong influence on the overall soil physical quality, after 3 years of field experiments, the soil additions with humified compost, under maize cropping, improved both, the yield of water stable macroaggregates and the soil aggregate stability, with a pronounced effect on the aggregate distribution of the coarse textured soil. Soil treatments with the biomimetic catalyst, under wheat cropping, promoted an initial stable incorporation of finer particle-sizes in water-stable macro-aggregates. This effect was progressively lost with increasing experimental time due to either loss or inactivation of the catalyst. Innovative management practices for SOM stabilization based on soil amendment of either humified mature compost or a water-soluble catalyst to promote in-situ photopolymerization of humic molecules, were found to improve distribution and stability of soil water stable aggregates, as compared to the conventional methods of SOM management.

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of plastic mulch patterns and crop rotations on runoff, erosion and soil physical properties in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The wide-plastic-mulch treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced runoff and soil loss compared to the narrow-plastic-mulch treatment, due to the better developed micro-basins found on the raised beds that enhanced infiltration in wide-plastic-mulch systems. Our results also indicated that inclusion of a winter wheat crop in the vegetable rotation did not alter the extent of runoff and soil loss from the vegetable field. Furthermore, we found that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion in vegetable seedling stages. There were significant correlations between soil loss and runoff volume (P < 0.01) and rainfall intensity (P < 0.01). The losses of total C, N and P were closely associated with that of the soil loss, and 82% of TC, 57% of TN and 75% of TP is entrained with sediment. After growing season, furrows without plastic mulch displayed lower total porosity and macroporosity (>60 mu m) that impeded infiltration in surface soil (0-5 cm). Higher water stability of soil macro-aggregates >2 mm were observed in plastic mulch ridges relative to the furrows after rain season.

The objective of the study was to determine the effects of clearing miombo woodland and converting the land to maize (Zea mays L.) cropping on selected soil properties on clay (Chromic luvisol) and loamy sand (Ferric acrisol) soils in central Zimbabwe. Soil samples were collected from undisturbed, cleared and cultivated woodlands after four cropping seasons and analyzed for soil organic C, total N and P. exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity, infiltration rate, aggregate stability and microbial biomass C and N at 0-5, 6-10 and 11-20 cm depths. Results showed that clearing and conversion of miombo woodlands to croplands reduced soil nutrients, cation exchange capacity (range: 9.6-21.0 cmol(c) kg(-1) in clay; 7.0-15.5 cmol(c) kg(-1) in loamy sand), and microbial C (range: 0.06-0.54% in clay; 0.02-0.37% in loamy sand). The extent and nature of change was variable, depending on the soil type and depth. Clearing of trees and leaving soil surface covered with grass did not always translate to a significant decline in soil organic C after four seasons (range: 0.69-2.24% in clay; 0.24-1.43% in loamy sand), unless the clearing was followed by successive cultivation and cropping without N fertilization. The reduced soil quality under cultivation was attributed to a potential pulse in decomposition and mineralization processes caused by soil disturbance, followed by leaching of released nutrients to lower horizons. This could be aided by nutrient removal in crop parts during harvest, without adequate soil nutrient replenishment. Under the woodland ecosystem, litter-fall may help to maintain steady-state infiltration rate (range: 45-126 cm h(-1) in clay; 32-97 cm h(-1) in loamy sand) by protecting the soil surface from damage and ensuring the formation of stable aggregates which preserve pore continuity. It was recommended that when miombo woodlands are to be cleared, management decisions that reduce tillage intensity and maximize residue retention should be put into practice; otherwise the clearing is strongly discouraged.

The carbon sequestration is affected by cropping system and management practices adopted. Rice-wheat is a dominant cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Previous studies done by different research workers revealed both its positive as well as negative impacts on carbon sequestration. The objective of this study was to determine C sequestration after nine year's rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L) cropping under an ongoing experiment at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab (India). This study was based on five treatments (100%N, 100%NP, 100%NPK, 100%NPK + FYM and the control). In the surface soil layer (0-15 cm), soil organic carbon (SOC) increased from the initial status of 2.42 to 3.26 g kg(-1) in the control, which significantly increased with the application of 100%NPK (4.11 g kg(-1)) and 100%NPK + FYM (4.55 g kg(-1)). The rice-wheat cropping even without any fertilization (control) contributed toward carbon sequestration (1.94 Mg C ha(-1)) with soil organic carbon pools and carbon sequestration rate of 7.84 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The soil organic carbon pools, carbon sequestration and rate of carbon sequestration as observed in treatment of balanced fertilization (100%NPK) were significantly increased from 9.19 to 9.99 Mg C ha(-1), 3.30 to 4.10 Mg C ha(-1) and 037 to 0.46 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively when farmyard manure was applied in conjunction with 100%NPK. The application of 100%NPK and 100%NPK + FYM significantly increased the soil labile carbon (1378 and 1578 mg kg(-1), respectively), water soluble carbon (35.3 and 37.2 mg kg, respectively) and water soluble carbohydrates (526 and 538 mg kg(-1), respectively) as compared to the control, where the corresponding values were 898, 16.8 and 464 mg kg(-1). The content of water stable aggregates organic carbon also increased with fertilization especially in combination with farmyard manure, whereas bulk density of soil was significantly reduced in the treatment of 100%NPK (1.49 Mg m(-3)) and 100%NPK + FYM (1.46 Mg m(-3)) over the control (1.60 Mg m(-3)). The fertilizer treatments (100%N, 100%NP and 100%NPK) made a positive influence on soil organic carbon content in subsurface layers (15-60 cm) also and it was more so in the treatment of 100%NPK + FYM as compared to the control, although contents did not differ significantly. Balanced fertilization (100%NPK) with and without FYM significantly improved the labile C content of soil (up to depth of 60 cm) over the control. Balanced fertilization in combination with FYM significantly increased the water soluble carbon content of soil in comparison to the control (up to depth of 60 cm). Bulk density of sub surface soil (15-60 cm) was reduced in all the treatments as compared to the control although the treatment effect was nonsignificant. The rice-wheat cropping sequence thus, showed the potential of mitigating atmospheric carbon load through its sequestration and integrated nutrient management may further enhance this potential.

This has disrupted the ability of soil to provide vital ecosystem services. Organic farming is often thought to conserve and utilise soil ecosystem services, and thus be a more sustainable method of food production than conventional farming. However, evidence for this is equivocal, and little is known of the potential trade-offs between soil functions, which can be classified as supporting and provisioning ecosystem services, in conventional and organic systems. In addition, few studies have simultaneously examined how surrounding landscape heterogeneity affects soil functions in agriculture. In this study we investigated the effects of farming method (conventional versus organic) and landscape heterogeneity (100 m, 500 m and 1000 m radius) on indicators of soil ecosystem services: soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water holding capacity (WHC) and plant-available phosphorous (P) (measures of carbon storage and nutrient retention); net N mineralisation and microbial community composition and biomass (nutrient cycling); and crop yield. We found no effect of landscape heterogeneity, and no differences in any of the measured soil and microbial variables between conventional and organic farms, apart from net N mineralisation, which was higher in organic farms. However, conventional farms had significantly greater yield than organic farms, and there was no apparent trade-off between increasing yield and the level of supporting ecosystem services. The organic farms in this study appear to have been intensively managed, with a straight substitution of organic inputs for chemicals, but little other effort to enhance soil fertility. For example, the organic farms applied large quantities of manure compared with conventional farms but conducted mechanical weeding (harrowing), whereas conventional farms applied herbicides. This repeated soil disturbance may cause rapid organic matter mineralisation and undermine the ability of these organic farms to retain carbon and nitrogen. The terms `organic' and `conventional' agriculture both cover a wide variety of farming methods, some of which enhance or deplete ecosystem services more than others. To develop truly sustainable methods of agriculture, research should focus on the effects of specific farming practices, rather than the labels `conventional' and `organic'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work was to study the effects of NT maintenance over time on soil aggregation and soil organic carbon (SOC) protection on a semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystem. A NT chronosequence was established with five phases: (i) conventional tillage (Cr); (ii) NT for I year (NT-1); (iii) NT for 4 years (NT-4); (iv) NT for 11 years (NT-11) and (v) NT for 20 years (NT-20). N fertilization was based on pig slurry for the whole experimental area. Soil samples were collected from four depths (i.e., 0-5,5-10, 10-20,20-30 cm). Dry and water-stable aggregates, SOC concentration and C concentration of water-stable aggregates were measured. SOC concentration reached its maximum value after 11 years under NT. However, the differences between NT phases were only found in the 0-5 cm soil depth. In soil surface (i.e., 0-5 cm), water-stable large macroaggregates (2-8 mm) were 0.02, 0.12, 0.32 and 0.31 g g(-1) dry soil for the NT-1, NT-4, NT-11 and NT-20 phases, respectively. C concentration of microaggregates increased in relation with the number of years under NT. SOC and water-stable macroaggregate stratification were greatest with the increase in the years under NT, emphasizing the close relationship between SOC and aggregation. In Mediterranean semiarid agroecosystems, the increase in the proportion of stable macroaggregates and the enrichment of C concentration within microaggregates are two main mechanisms of SOC protection when NT is maintained over time.

How this more intensive management and land use for the more profitable cash crops affects soil nutrients is of great concern for carbon, soil and water quality management In this paper, we attempted to assess the influence of cash crop ecosystems on soil nutrients in the catchment upstream of the Guanting Reservoir, in the Beijing municipality, North China plain. Soil nutrients in cash crop (orchard and vegetable) ecosystems with between 8 and 20 years of intensive management history were compared with traditional agro-ecosystem management patterns (corn and soybean). Results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) had improved, and total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P) concentrations had marginally increased under intensive management practices in the vegetable and orchard ecosystems in the last 25 years. The increases in SOC and total P densities at the 100 cm soil depth in orchard, vegetable and irrigated corn systems were greater than those in the rain fed corn and soybean systems. Soil available P and electrical conductivity (EC) were highest in the vegetable lands. However, no significant changes were found between the soil physical properties (i.e. bulk density, clay content and water stable aggregate content) of the traditional and cash-cropping systems. Multi regression analysis showed that manure and mineral fertilizer contributed significantly to the increase in soil nutrients. Intensively managed orchards are a better option for improving soil quality and SOC sequestration. However, the risks of nonpoint source pollution from, and soil salinization in, the land used for vegetable cultivation should be considered in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, its influence was investigated on soil fertility and aggregation in 3 different land use systems of the humid forest zone of southern Cameroon. Soils were sampled at 10 cm depth from 03 native forest, 03 fallow and 03 continuous growing fields systems at Metet (South Cameroon) for the determination of easily extractable glomalin (EEG), total glomalin (TG), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and soil water stable aggregate of 1-2 mm diameter (WSA(1-2mm)). Results showed that both EEG and TG concentrations significantly decreased (P < 0.01) from the forest to the growing field, via the fallow system. The rate of EEG decrease was 29.82 % and 38.35 % in the fallow and the growing field system compared to the forest system, respectively. For TG, the decrease rate was 16.65 % to 46.04 % for the fallow and the growing field system compare to the forest system respectively; while C, N, and organic matter (OM) did not changed significantly. The proportion of C, N and OM were 93.6 %, 88.3 %, 93.7 % for the growing field system compared to the forest system respectively. The WSA(1-2mm) decreased from the forest to fallow and growing field systems, with respective rates of 19.69% and 32.81 %. There was high positive correlation between C, N and EEG (r(2) = 0.76, 0.55; P < 0.01), suggesting the possible implication of glomalin to soil stock of C and N. Likewise, the high positive correlation between TG and WSA(1-2mm) (r(2) = 0.64, P < 0.01), C and TG (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.05), OM and WSA(1-2mm) (r(2) = 0.57, P < 0.01) as well as OM and TG (r(2) = 0.88, P < 0.01) suggests that glomalin, C and N may contribute to the formation of WSA(1-2mm), and thereby promote the build up of soil structure. These results highlight the view that glomalin can be used as an indicator of soil fertility in this region and should be consider as a criteria when define agricultural management strategies.","Fokom, R.; Megapche, Ngonkeu E.

With the completion of the GAP project about half of the 3.2 million ha of agricultural land (1.7 million ha) will be used for irrigated agriculture. New intensive agricultural systems are expected to change the soil quality in the region. It is, therefore, imperative to monitor the soil quality for sustainable use and management in the region. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of soil tillage methods (plough and chisel processes and no tillage) of Harran Plain selected soil physical and chemical (bulk density, saturation percentage, porosity, aggregate stability, organic matter content, soil pH, available N, P, and K) properties, all of which were identified as possible soil quality indicators.

The results of our 2-year study on the use of a SQI to assess were monitored at regular intervals, and yield of the maize were compared to soil tillage methods. Data from soil tillage methods were used to calculate the SQI values for the different treatments. Results revealed that treatment of soil tillage methods improved yield of maize bur did not change or increase quality of surface soil as indicated by increased values of soil quality indicators.

An energy saving way is that of implementing optimal technology specific to each culture and pedoclimatic area. The minimum tillage and no-tillage systems represent alternatives to the conventional system of soil tillage, due to their conservation effects on soil features and to the assured productions, maize: 96-98.1% at minimum tillage and 99.8% at no-tillage, soybean: 102.9-111.9% at minimum tillage and 117.2% at no-tillage, wheat: 93.4-96.8% at minimum tillage and 106.9% at no-tillage, as compared to the conventional system. Correct choice of the right soil tillage system for the crops in rotation helps reduce energy consumption, thus maize: 97.3-97.9% at minimum tillage and 91.3% at no-tillage, soybean: 98.6-98.2% at minimum tillage and 92.8% at no-tillage, wheat: 97.4-98% at minimum tillage and 91.6% at no-tillage. Energy efficiency is in relation to reductions in energy savings, but also with efficiency and impact on the tillage system on the cultivated plant. For all crops in rotation, energy efficiency (energy produced from 1 MJ consumed) was best in no-tillage and 10.44 MJ ha(-1) at maize, 6.49 MJ ha(-1) at soybean and 5.66 MJ ha(-1) at wheat. Energy-efficient agricultural system: the energy consumed-energy produced-energy yield, necessarily have to be supplemented by soil energy efficiency, with the conservative effect of the agricultural system. Only then the agricultural system will be sustainable, durable in agronomic, economic and ecological terms. The implementation of minimum and no-tillage soil systems have increased the organic matter content from 2 to 7.6% and water-stable aggregate content from 5.6 to 9.6%, at 0-30 cm depth, as compared to the conventional system. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate stability have initially been low, the effect of conservation practices on the soil characteristics led to a positive impact on the water permeability in the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop growth led to a better plant watering condition. Subsequent release of conserved soil water regulated proper plant water condition and soil structure.","Moraru, Paula Ioana; Rusu, Teodor",,11,2013,,,

A particular attention was paid to the properties of the humus layer of the developing soils, among them, their texture which belongs to the most important soil diagnostic features. Experiments were carried out in 2010 on the experimental field of the Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of Life Sciences in Poznan. A combination without mineral fertilisation (0NPK) was established on each of the analysed use systems. In the case of the fodder-cereal and rape-cereal systems, additionally, two levels of mineral fertilisation: 1NPK in rape-cereal system (rape: 200 kg N, 70 kg P2O5, 90 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and in fodder- cereal (lucerne: 170 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 150 kg K2O; wheat: 160 kg N, 40 kg P2O5, 80 kg K2O) and 2NPK were applied. The control was post-mining ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment. The evaluation of changes in the selected, most important soil structure parameters was based on the original methodological solution elaborated at the Department of Soil Science and Reclamation of the University of Life Sciences in Poznan in which the basic element is a regular soil aggregate of 1 cm(3) volume. The following parameters were determined for such aggregates cut out from two depths of the humus layer (7 and 15 cm): dynamic water resistance (SW), static water resistance (SW), secondary aggregation after dynamic and static water action, time of capillary rise (T-kmin), capillary minimal (V-kmin) and maximal (V-kmax) water capacity and compression strength (Rc). The above-mentioned properties were determined in 5 replications. Using methods commonly employed in soil science, the following parameters were determined: texture composition, solid phase density, bulk density and porosity, hygroscopic capacity and maximal hygroscopic capacity as well as soil reaction and carbonate, carbon and nitrogen contents. Reclamation treatments applied in the course of the past 32 years and soil-forming processes taking place under their influence led to distinct changes in the morphological structure of the examined profiles, primarily, in their surface layer. The smallest morphological changes were observed in the profile sampled from the plot with long-term lucerne cultivation (so-called “conservation”). The profiles representing the fodder-cereal use system exhibited a more advanced stadium of soil-forming processes. Their humus layer was more distinctive, with dark colour, its thickness ranged from 20 to 28 cm corresponding to the depth of the performed ploughing. Identical features and better homogeneity were observed in the case of the humus horizon developed in the rape-cereal system of agricultural use, although certain differences were recorded in profile morphology depending on the level of the applied mineral fertilisation (1NPK and 2NPK). Post-mining ground which was not subjected to any reclamation treatment was found to contain the smallest quantities of organic material carbon and nitrogen (2.65-2.84 g.kg(-1)). The amount of oxidisable carbon in the fodder-cereal system of agricultural use was 2.5 to 3 times higher (6.45-8.82 g.kg(-1)) than in the untreated post-mining ground irrespective of the level of mineral fertilisation. On the other hand, the amount of carbon was more varied in the rape-cereal system of use. In the case of absence of fertilisation (0NPK), this quantity was by about 50% higher in comparison with the post-mining ground and amounted to 3.1 g.kg(-1). Elevated fertilisation with 1NPK and 2NPK doses increased levels of carbon to values similar as in the fodder-cereal system. The highest quantity of carbon of about 12 g.kg(-1) was recorded in the humus horizon developed on the surface representing permanent lucerne (so-called “conservation”). A distinct variability was also observed in the physical properties of soils from the examined systems of agricultural use. Untreated post-mining grounds were characterised by high bulk density (1.97-2.02 Mg.m(-3)) and, consequently, by low general porosity (23.6 to 25.3%). In the fodder-cereal use system, soil density was found to be by about 0.30 Mg.m(-3) lower and porosity by about 10% higher. In the case of the rape-cereal system of agricultural use, soil density was only by about 0.1 Mg.m(-3) higher and general porosity by about 5% lower in comparison with the fodder-cereal system. Bulk density and general porosity in the so-called “conservation” system of use amounted to 1.35-1.51 Mg.m(-3) and 42.8-48.9%, respectively, in other words, exhibited the most advantageous values of these features from the point of view of agricultural usage. Recapitulating, it should be emphasised that widely distinguished two soil-forming factors, namely: time and human activity begin to play a dominant role in the formation of soils, especially in areas which undergo large industrial geomechanical transformations mainly as a result of open-cast mining of different minerals.","Gilewska, Miroslawa; Otremba, Krzysztof; Owczarzak, Wojciech",,15,2013,,,

Hydro-physical (density, porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, void ratio, and water retention) and mechanical properties (preconsolidation pressure, compression index, coefficient of decompression, and recovery rate) were evaluated in the horizons A(1) (0.0-0.25 m), A(2) (0.25-0.51 m), Cg(1) (0.51-0.92 m) and Cg(2) (0.92-1.20+ m) in soil of a natural area and in Ap (0.0-0.17 m), A (0.17-0.40 m), Cg(1) (0.40-0.70 m) and Cg(2) (0.70-1.00+ m) of soil under rice. Cluster analysis showed that eight years of conventionally tilled rice under flood irrigation did not significantly alter the physico-mechanical and hydro-physical properties. However, rice cultivation increased bulk density and reduced the void ratio, total porosity and macroporosity. The ratio of elasticity with bulk density, porosity and void ratio was affected by the type of soil structure, since compression and decompression were higher in horizons with prismatic than with massive structure.","Gubiani, Paulo Ivonir; Mentges, Marcelo Ivan; Reichert, Jose Miguel; Reinert, Dalvan Jose; Xavier, Alencar",,37,2013,,,

A long-term (19902006) field experiment was conducted at a typical subtropical hilly agriculture region in south central China. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of long-term fertilizations on i) accumulations and distributions of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in different sizes of water-stable aggregates (WSA); ii) dynamic change of soil C, N, and P over years; and iii) the rice yield. Application of organic materials (OM), especially in combination with chemical fertilizers, increased soil organic C (SOC), soil total N (NT), and soil total P (PT) concentrations in all sizes of WSA, and they more concentrated in WSA (>1 mm). However, single chemical fertilizers had little impact on SOC and NT. There were significantly positive correlations between SOC and NT in each size of WSA, (r0.977, n = 15, P < 0.01). It illuminated that application of organic materials benefited the conservation of soil nitrogen. However, application of organic materials had less impact on PT. Variation of C/P was larger than C/N. PT was mainly affected by input of phosphorus. Data over years showed that SOC and NT continued to rise, whereas PT tended to decline irrespective of treatments. Furthermore, economical chemical fertilizers application combining with green manure and half straw returning (NPKe + SR) can produce approximate effects on PT as conventional dose of chemical fertilizers (NPKc). Average rice yield of NPKc for 17years was 9399kg ha1. Compared with NPKc, OM decreased yield by only 4.4%, which indicated that traditional organic fertilization could obtain relatively high yield. NPKe + SR obtained approximate yield as NPKc did, which showed that green manure and half amount of straw effectually reduced chemical fertilizers by about one third.","Chen, Anlei; Chen, Weicai; Wang, Wei; Xie, Xiaoli; Yin, Chunmei",,36,2013,,,

In Tunisia, the applicability of CA was poorly documented. This study was carried out to evaluate changes in soil organic matter (SUM) and water properties generated by seven (NT7) and three (NT3) years of applying NT as compared to conventional tillage (CT). On three adjacent large plots, a field experiment was established since the growing season 2000/01 under rain-fed conditions on a clay loam soil in a dry subhumid zone of North Tunisia. In NT3 plot, a cultivation of wheat/fava bean sequence was investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 450 kg ha(-1) were left on the soil surface for wheat and fava bean, respectively. In NT7 plot, a cultivation of wheat/sulla sequence was investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha(-1) and 700 kg ha(-1) were left on the soil surface for wheat and sulla, respectively. However for the CT plot, a moldboard plowing at approximately 20 cm depth was managed for continuous wheat production. The selected key parameters evaluated for a 0-30 cm soil profile were SOM, bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), macro-porosity (MP), micro-porosity (mP), soil water retention at field capacity (FC) and at permanent wilting point (PWP), available water content (AWC) and soil moisture content (SMC). NT7 have increased significantly (p < 0.05) levels of SOM at the top 30 cm soil layer, which in turn enhanced BD and TP of soil as compared to CT. However, improvement of these parameters was restricted to 0-10 cm layer with NT3. Both NT3 and NT7 have increased considerably (p < 0.05) mP at 030 cm thereby increasing soil water content at FC and PWP, whereas MP was remarkably reduced by NT treatments as compared to CT but reduction was less important in NT7 plot. AWC was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in NT7 across the 30 cm profile while NT3 and CT have similar effect to each other. SMC was improved at different soil depths by NT system during the whole agricultural season and the highest content was found with NT3. Soil moisture values increased with increasing soil depth in both NT3 and NT7 indicating a good water infiltration induced by these treatments. Hence, water storage properties in rooting zone could be enhanced by NT7 and NT3 but water availability for plants was more important with NT7. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To develop efficient soil-management practices for the rapid restoration of severely degraded soils, no-till, mulch-based cropping systems have been adopted. Thus, a study was conducted on a farm to evaluate the effect of a no-tillage system (NT) versus conventional tillage (CT) on the vertical (0-50 cm) distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), structural instability (SI), stable aggregates and infiltration coefficient (Ks) in a clay loam soil under rain-fed conditions in a semiarid region of northwestern Tunisia. CT consisting of moldboard plowing to a depth of 20 cm was used for continuous wheat production. NT by direct drilling under residue was used for 3 (NT3) and 7 (NT7) years in wheat/fava bean and wheat/sulla crop rotations, respectively. SOC was more significantly increased (p < 0.05) by NT3 and NT7 than by CT at respective depths of 0-10 and 0-20 cm, but a greater increase in the uppermost 10 cm of soil was observed in the NT7 field. NT3 management decreased BD and consequently increased TP at a depth of 0-10 cm. The same trend was observed for the NT7 treatment at a depth of 0-30 cm. Ks was not affected by the NT3 treatment but was improved at a depth of 0-30 cm by the NT7 treatment. Changes in BD, TP and Ks in the NT7 plot were significant only in the first 10 cm of the soil. Both NT3 and NT7 considerably reduced SI (p < 0.1) and enhanced stable aggregates (p < 0.05) across the soil profile. These differences were most pronounced under NT7 at a depth of 0-10 cm. The stratification ratio (SR) of the selected soil properties, except that of SI, showed significant differences between the CT and NT trials, indicating an improvement in soil quality. NT management in the farming systems of north-western Tunisia was demonstrated in this study to improve soil quality, especially in the surface layers, by increasing storage of organic carbon and enhancing the physical properties of the soil. These effects were most pronounced in the long term. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the stream discharge of four small headwater catchments located within an area of 6 km 2 in western Kenya was examined for 2 years (2007 and 2008). The four catchments cover a degradation gradient ranging from intact forest to agricultural land under maize cultivation for 5, 10, and 50 years. The runoff ratio (e. g., annual catchment discharge expressed as a percentage of rainfall) increased with increasing duration of cultivation from an average of 16.0% in the forest to 32.4% in the 50-yr-old agricultural catchment. Similarly, the average runoff ratio due to the stormflow component was 0.033 in the forest and increased gradually to 0.095 with increasing duration of cultivation. The conversion from forest to agricultural land in the first 5 years caused about half of the total observed increases in runoff ratio (46.3%) and discharge in relation to rainfall (50.6%). The other half of the changes in discharge occurred later during soil degradation after forest clearing. With increasing duration of cultivation, soil bulk density rho(b) at a depth of 0-0.1 m increased by 46%, while soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and total porosity decreased by 75% and 20%, respectively. The changes in hydrological responses that occurred in the initial years after forest clearing may suggest a significant potential for improved land management in alleviating runoff and enhanced storm flow and moisture retention in agricultural watersheds.","Johnson, Mark; Lehmann, Johannes; Pell, Alice; Recha, John W.; Verchot, Louis; Walter, M.

Six commercial sites under these agroecosystems were compared to neighboring areas of native forest in five areas along this region (Coruripe, Umbauba, Acajutiba, Cruz das Almas and Nova Vicosa). Soil samples were taken from 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth and analyzed for particle size distribution, bulk density, organic C (OC), particulate organic matter, C in soil solution, microbial biomass C, total cation exchange capacity and water stable aggregates. Linear correlation and multivariate techniques were used for data analysis. The values of base saturation and Al saturation for the 0-20 cm depth layer were also calculated. In all the studied areas, soils under native forest presented better status of physical and chemical attributes than their agroecosystem counterparts, especially in the 0-5 cm layer. For both layers, OC content was the attribute most strongly correlated with the overall changes in all attributes. Unexpectedly, the OC content showed no significant correlation with the sum of silt and clay contents.

This might be achieved by sound fertilization management, though impacts of fertilization on OM have been rarely investigated with the aid of physical fractionation techniques in semiarid regions. This study aimed at examining changes in organic C (OC) and N concentrations of physically separated soil OM pools after 26 y of fertilization at a site of the semiarid Loess Plateau in China. To separate sensitive OM pools, total macro-OM (> 0.05?mm) was obtained from bulk soil by wet-sieving and then separated into light macro-OM (< 1.8 g?cm3) and heavy macro-OM (> 1.8 g?cm3) subfractions; bulk soil was also differentiated into light OM (< 1.8 g?cm3) and mineral-associated OM (> 1.8 g?cm3). Farmyard manure increased concentrations of total macro-OC and N by 19% and 25%, and those of light fraction OC and N by 36% and 46%, compared to no manuring; both light OC and N concentrations but only total macro-OC concentration responded positively to mineral fertilizations compared to no mineral fertilization. This demonstrated that the light-fraction OM was more sensitive to organic or inorganic fertilization than the total macro-OM. Mineral-associated OC and N concentrations also increased by manuring or mineral fertilizations, indicating an increase of stable OM relative to no fertilization treatment, however, their shares on bulk soil OC and N decreased. Mineral fertilizations improved soil OM quality by decreasing C : N ratio in the light OM fraction whereas manuring led to a decline of the C : N ratio in the total macro-OM fraction, with respect to nil treatment. Further fractionation of the total macro-OM according to density clarified that across treatments about 3/4 of total macro-OM was associated with minerals. Thus, by simultaneously applying particle-size and density separation procedures, we clearly demonstrated that the macro-OM differed from the light OM fraction not only in its chemical composition but also in associations with minerals. The proportion of the 0.50.25?mm water-stable aggregates of soil was higher under organic or inorganic fertilizations than under no manure or no mineral fertilization, and increases in OC and N concentrations of water-stable aggregates as affected by fertilization were greater for 10.5 and 0.50.25?mm classes than for the other classes. Results indicate that OM stocks in different soil pools can be increased and the loose aggregation of these strongly eroded loess soils can be improved by organic or inorganic fertilization.","Chen, Zhao Ming; E, Sheng Zhe; Guggenberger, Georg; Li, Xiao Gang; Li, Xiao Hang; Song, Jian Rong",,175,2012,,,

Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity (HC), bulk density (BD), mean weight diameter (MWD), available water content (AWC) and total porosity at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths. The highest HC values of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths were obtained with CT1 (9.70x10(-6) m s(-1), 8.74x10(-6) m s(-1)) and CT2 (9.39x10(-6) m s(-1), 8.58x10(-6) m s(-1)) applications. CT2 treatment destructed the soil aggregates and resulted in greater bulk density and low total porosity at 0-10 cm depth. The available water content at 0-10 cm depth was significantly reduced with the CT1 (P<0.01) and CT2 applications (P<0.05). Although three years of no-tillage application in clay rich soils caused higher bulk density and low porosity, increase in MWD is an indication of soil and water conservation. Therefore, no till and reduced till applications should be adapted to the farmers' conditions for sustainability in agriculture.","Acir, N.; Celik, I.; Turgut, M. M.",,6,2012,,,

In 2006, we began a long-term field experiment based on a ricewheat rotation cropping system, having a control without fertilizer (NF) and three treatments: chemical fertilizers (CF), pig manure compost (PMC) and a prilled mixture of PMC and inorganic fertilizers (OICF). Following the harvest of wheat in 2010, the mean-weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates and the concentration of C and N in bulk soil (020 cm; <2 mm fraction) were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in PMC and NF plots than in CF or OICF plots. Pig manure compost significantly increased the proportion of >5-mm aggregates, whereas CF significantly increased the proportion of 0.45- to 1-mm aggregates. The C and N contents of all density fractions were greater in PMC than in other treatments with levels decreasing in the following order: free particulate organic matter (fPOM) >occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) > mineral-combined SOM (mineralSOM). Solid-state 13C CPMAS NMR spectra showed that alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratios and aromatic component levels of SOM were smaller in PMC and OICF plots than in CF plots, suggesting that SOM in PMC and OICF plots was less degraded than that in CF plots. Nevertheless, yields of wheat in PMC and NF plots were smaller than those in CF and OICF plots, indicating that conditions for producing large grain yields did not maintain soil fertility.","Huang, Qiwei; Ran, Wei; Shen, Qirong; Wang, Qiujun; Zhang, Jianchao; Zhang, Li",,28,2012,,,

Afforestation on such lands with monoculture and mixed species reclaims the soils with different efficiencies. We studied the physico-chemical and microbial properties along with enzymatic activities of degraded sodic land (control), rehabilitated sodic lands planted under Terminalia arjuna (R-TA), Prosopis juliflora (R-PJ) and mixed forest (R-MF) from two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm). The properties of rehabilitated land uses were compared with the soils of corresponding reference (standard) land use under Tectona grandis (Ref-TG) plantation and mixed forest (Ref-MF) growing in the natural forest range of same biogeographic region to determine the status of improvement. The objective of the study was to determine efficient ecological model for the restoration of degraded sodic land. The bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) reduced during restoration under both, pure plantations as well as mixed forest. Increase in water holding capacity (WHC), organic carbon, soil nutrients, microbial biomass (MB) [carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus], microbial counts, CO2 flux and enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, protease and acidic phosphatase) showed significant improvement in the soil quality of rehabilitated sites. At 0-15 cm soil depth in rehabilitated and reference land uses, in comparison to D-SL, organic carbon, nitrogen (total and available), available phosphorus, exchangeable cations (Na+, Ca++ and Mg++), MB (carbon and nitrogen) and activities of all enzymes, except alkaline phosphatase, were significantly greater, while other soil properties showed land use specific trends. The overall gain percent in physico-chemical soil properties varied from 54% under plantations to 77% under mixed forest (R-MF). Corresponding gain in microbial biomass was 21% (R-TA) and 34% (R-PJ) under plantation soils against 90% in mixed forest soil. The enzyme activities (on average) have also attained maximum gain% under R-MF (77%) followed by R-PJ (47%) and R-TA (35%) in decreasing order which indicates that afforestation with multiple tree species is a relatively good option for sustainable rehabilitation of sodic lands.

Separate plots of oat and grazing vetch cover crops were grown in winter and then maize was planted in all plots in the following summer season. The four fertilization regimes used were: (i) fertilizer applied to the cover crops and the maize crop (F1), (ii) fertilizer applied to cover crops only (F2), (iii) fertilizer applied to the maize crop only (F3) and (iv) no fertilizer applied (F4). Control plots (weedy fallows) were included and the treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soil samples from 0-5, 5-20 and 20-50 cm depths were analyzed for total SOM, particulate organic matter (POM) fractions, hot water soluble C (HWC) and C-associated with water stable macro- and micro-aggregates (WSAC). While total SOM was more concentrated in the 0-5 cm soil depth across treatments, a lack of maize fertilization (F2 and F4 regimes) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the stratification ratio. Oat and grazing vetch rotations produced significantly higher (P < 0.05) fine POM, coarse POM and HWC than weedy fallow rotations at 0-5 and 5-20 cm. When fertilized, oat was better able to support SOM sequestration in water stable aggregates at 0-20 cm while grazing vetch was more effective at 20-50 cm. The F3 regime had similar SOM levels as the F2. When no fertilizer was applied (F4-regime), there were significant (P < 0.01) reductions in biomass input and total SOM on the oat-maize and weedy fallow-maize rotations whereas the grazing vetch-maize rotation did not respond, both at 0-5 and 5-20 cm. The findings suggested that in the low fertilizer input CA system, targeting fertilizer to the winter cover crop as opposed to the maize crop could give similar SOM response, with less fertilizer invested and that grazing vetch cover crops may be better suited to low N input CA systems for SOM improvement.

On the other hand, it can be used to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices on soil quality across many land use systems. We assessed land use impact on glomalin related soil proteins (GRSPs), soil quality and aggregation in the humid forest zone in southern Cameroon. Forest, short fallow and field crop production soil samples were used to determine GRSPs, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water stable aggregate (WSA(1-2mm)). Results showed that GRSPs significantly decreased from the forest to fallow and the field crop production systems. The easily extractable GRSP (EEGRSP) was 30% and 39% less under fallow and field crop production respectively, relative to the forest soils. Similarly, total GRSP (TGRSP) was 17% and 46% less under fallow and field crop production respectively, relative to the forest soils. C, N, and organic matter (OM) did not change significantly within the land use systems. The WSA(1-2mm) was 20% less under fallow, and 33% less under field crop production relative to the forest system. However, AMF spores augmented from forest to fallow and field crop production system. There was a positive correlation between GRSPs (EEGRSP, TGRSP) and AM fungal spore density suggesting the possible implication of these fungi to the production of the GRSP in this zone. There was also a positive correlation between C, N and EEGRSP, suggesting the implication of GRSP in stocking soil C and N in this zone. Likewise, a positive correlation between OM and TGRSP was found meaning the implication of GRSPs to OM pools in the soil of this zone. WSA(1-2mm) was also correlated with TGRSP, C and OM, suggesting the possible coactions of GRSP, OM to the formation of WSA(1-2mm), and thereby promoting the build up of soil structure. These results highlight the view that GRSP can be used as an indicator of soil quality in this region and should be considered as a criteria when define agricultural management strategies.

Productivities of gliricidia shoots (GSP) and maize grain (MGP) were evaluated from 2001 to 2003. In 2004, soil samples were taken from the experimental plots at 0-5 cm and 5-20 cm depths and analyzed for total and particulate organic C (TOC and POM-C), percent of water stable aggregates (WSA), aggregate mean weighed diameter and cation exchange capacity (CEC). An adjacent native forest and a sole maize field under conventional till were also sampled as reference areas. Increasing pruning frequency resulted in a reduction of GSP from 6 and 4 t ha(-1) y(-1), with 3 and 4 cuts yr(-1) respectively, to 1 t ha(-1) y(-1), with 6 cuts yr(-1). However, the 3 cuts yr(-1) treatment significantly reduced MGP in about 40% and 25%, respectively in 2000 and 2001, compared to the other pruning treatments, likely due to an increased competition between the maize and gliricidia plants. The high input to the soil of gliricidia shoot biomass with 3 or 4 cuts yr(-1) promoted an improvement in soil quality at the 0-5 cm soil layer characterized by an increase of 35% in POM-C and 10% in WSA, and a multivariate-based soil profile closer to that of the native forest, compared to the 6 cuts yr(-1) treatment. Our results indicate that 4 cuts yr(-1) of the gliricidia hedges provided the best trade-off between residue and maize grain production, and resulted in significant improvements in soil quality.

Our objective was to examine the effects of these land uses on the activities of selected enzymes (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, and dehydrogenase), proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The beta-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil while beta-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0-10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg(-1) in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and beta-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r a parts per thousand yen 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters.

In the present study, the influence of 18-22 years of land abandonment on soil properties, C dynamics and microbial biomass was evaluated in closely situated wheat and alfalfa farmlands, and abandoned lands on calcareous soils, Central Iran. Soil properties of the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths from abandoned lands were compared to those from conventionally cultivated lands (i.e., continuous wheat-fallow and alfalfa-wheat rotation) common in calcareous soils of Central Zagros Mountains. Soil bulk density in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers decreased significantly while total porosity increased significantly in abandoned lands. Generally, soil aggregate stability tended to increase within the abandoned fields owing to increased water-stable macro-aggregates. Soil organic C (OC) contents (g kg(-1)) and pools (Mg ha(-1)) in the 0-15 cm soil layer increased significantly in abandoned lands compared with cultivated lands, with no effect in the 15-30 cm soil layer after 18-22 years of land abandonment, suggesting the restoration of C is pronounced in the upper 0-15 cm soil depth . The total C accumulation in abandoned lands was 7.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the entire sampling depth (0-30 cm) over the 18-22 years of land abandonment, which was 26% greater relative to cultivated lands. Carbon mineralization (Cmin) followed a trend similar to organic C, whereas C turnover (Cmin/OC ratio) was slightly greater in wheat fields. However, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) did not vary considerably among the three land uses. In brief, improvements, albeit slowly, in soil properties of the top layer with the cessation of cultivation indicated that land abandonment may result in enhanced soil C sequestration, and would maintain fertility and productivity of the farmlands of semi-arid climates.","Raiesi, Fayez",,351,2012,,,

Straw on the soil surface, by creating a physical barrier between the wheel and the ground may be a factor to minimize compaction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of millet straw on soil surface in reducing compaction caused by the tractor wheels. The experiment consisted of four treatments of straw quantity on surface (without straw and 5, 10 and 15 Mg ha(-1)) and three straw managements (standing up, lying down and fragmented). After the tractor passage, penetration resistance, water content, density and total porosity of soil were evaluated on the area where the wheel passed over. Density and porosity were not affected by wheel traffic. Treatments with straw had higher water content and as a result less resistance. There was no significant difference on resistance and soil moisture among straw management treatments. For an equal soil water content, higher densities of straw resulted in lower penetration resistance, which indicates less compaction.","De Maria, Isabella Clerici; Lemos e Silva, Renato; Rosim, Daniel Coelho; da Silva, Alvaro Pires",,71,2012,,,

In tropical Africa, this land use change results in progressive soil degradation, as the period of cultivation increases. Both rates and variation in infiltration, soil carbon concentration and other soil parameters are influenced by management within agricultural systems, but they have rarely been well documented in East Africa. We constructed a chronosequence for an area of western Kenya, using two native forest sites and six fields that had been converted to agriculture for up to 119 yr. We assessed changes in infiltrability (the steady-state infiltration rate), bulk density, proportion of macro- and microaggregates in soil, soil C and N concentrations, as well as the isotopic signature of soil C (delta C-13), along the 119-yr chronosequence of conversion from natural forest to agriculture. Infiltration, soil C and N decreased within 40 yr after conversion, while bulk density increased. Median infiltration rates fell to about 15% of the initial values in the forest, and C and N concentrations dropped to around 60%, whilst the bulk density increased by 50%.

The common cropping pattern before the study was early-late rice-fallow (winter). The field treatments included rice-rice-fallow (R-R-WF), rice-rice-rape (R-R-RP), rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch (R-R-MV), and rice-rice-ryegrass (R-R-RG). The rape, Chinese milk vetch and ryegrass were all incorporated as green manures 15 d before early rice transplanting during the following year. The soil bulk density in all green manure treatments was significantly reduced compared with the winter fallow treatment. Soil porosity with green manure applications was significantly higher than that under the winter fallow. The green manure treatments had higher 0.25-5 mm water stable aggregates and aggregates stabilities in the plow layer (0-15 cm depth) compared with the fallow treatment. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and normalized mean weight diameter (NMWD) of aggregates in the green manure treatment were larger than that with the winter fallow.

The study was carried out in a cane plantation in Rolandia, Parana State, where treatments consisted of a number of cuts (1, 3, 8, 10 and 16), harvested as green and burned sugarcane, at which soil bulk density, macro and microporosity, penetration resistance, as well as root length, density and area were determined. Results showed that sugarcane management practices lead to alterations in soil penetration resistance, bulk density and porosity, compared to native forest soil. These alterations in soil physical characteristics impede the full growth of the sugarcane root system beneath 10 cm, in all growing seasons analyzed.","Baquero, Jose Euripides; Guimaraes, Maria de Fatima; Medina, Cristiane de Conti; Ralisch, Ricardo; Tavares Filho, Joao",,36,2012,,,

Soil samples (5 per management system) were systematically collected (0-25 cm layer) in the summer growing season, to quantify soil organic matter, bulk density, macroporosity and flocculation, as well as soybean yield. The highest values for soil bulk density and organic matter content and the lowest for macroporosity were observed in the no-till system alone, whereas in the no-till system with quarterly chiseling the values for organic matter content were lowest, and no-tillage crop rotation resulted in the highest values for organic matter and macroporosity, and the lowest for soil bulk density. The average soybean yield was highest under no-till and trimestrial chiseling or crop rotation, and lowest for no-tillage annual crops no-tillage annual crops alone.","Curmi, Pierre; Guimaraes, Maria de Fatima; Tavares Filho, Joao; Tessier, Daniel",,36,2012,,,

Soil physicochemical and microbiological properties were measured across a range of E. grandis plantation ages (1-10 years) in south-western China to determine whether and how eucalypt afforestation of agricultural land affected the soil fertility. The results indicate that afforestation with E. grandis caused changes in soil properties with soil depth, and the changes were dependent on the stand age. Soil bulk density decreased significantly, but water-holding capacity increased significantly with time. Soil organic matter content, C:N ratio, and soil microbial biomass C and N concentrations showed an initial phase of decline and then increased significantly over time in the upper soil layers of E. grandis plantations aged from 1 to 4 or 5 years. Soil pH in E. grandis plantations did not change significantly with stand age or soil layer. Cation exchange capacity in the upper soil layer of E. grandis plantations increased significantly over time. Total exchangeable bases and base saturation in the soil decreased significantly with depth and with increasing plantation age. Furthermore, E. grandis afforestation of arable soils had no significant effects on total N, total P, and available P contents. The requirements of the trees, understory microenvironmental conditions, and allelopathic effects might play important roles in the dynamic changes of soil physicochemical and microbiological properties. The results demonstrate the progressive development of processes that lead to the restoration of soil fertility following E. grandis afforestation of arable soils. However, most of the properties measured for the afforested soils resembled the properties of arable soils and did not resemble those of the soil of control forests. Thus, reversion of soil properties in the study plantations is likely to require a considerable period of time. Long-term research is needed to understand changes in the soil properties resulting from afforestation with Eucalyptus and to predict future trends.","Wu, Fuzhong; Yang, Wanqin; Zhang, Danju; Zhang, Jian",,50,2012,,,

Clearing of the native vegetation resulted in a significant reduction of soil organic carbon content and losses of structure stability and soil porosity. No differences were seen in cation exchange capacity between native forest and cultivated land, whereas specific surface area increased with decreased levels of organic carbon content following agricultural use.

The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with nine treatments [control, varying doses of PBSW (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 m(3) ha(-1)), farmyard manure (FYM) + recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), and FYM + gypsum at 50% gypsum requirement (GR) + RDF] with three replications. The FYM dose was 5 Mg ha(-1). The experimental soil was sodic calcareous, being of the Sawargaon series of isohyperthermic family of Vertic haplustepts with high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), low available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and high available potassium (K). The results revealed that the physical properties [bulk density, mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates, and hydraulic conductivity] of soil were improved in both layers of sodic soil (0-30 and 30-60 cm) as a result of the addition of increased doses of PBSW. The significant reduction in pH, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), ESP and increase in organic carbon, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and electrical conductivity (EC) were observed in both soil layers as a result of the addition of PBSW at 180 m(3) ha(-1). The changes in chemical properties were also seen in the treatment of FYM + GR + RDF, but it was at par with lower doses of PBSW (30 to 90 m(3) ha(-1)). The microbial populations [bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, azotobacter, and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria] increased with an increase in the levels of application of PBSW. However, it was maximum in FYM + GR + RDF treatment, and it showed an overall increase up to the flowering stage and thereafter reduced at harvest. The soil basal respiration as mg carbon dioxide (CO2) increased with the increase in levels of PBSW application but it was the greatest in the FYM + gypsum + RDF treatment. Among the PBSW treatments, the greatest activities of soil enzymes (urease, dehydrogenase, and acid phosphatase) under the treatment of 180 m(3) ha(-1) PBSW were observed at the flowering stage. The available N, P, and K after harvest of sunflower crop were significantly greater in the PBSW treatment applied at 180 m(3) ha(-1); however, N, P, and K uptake and yield of sunflower were significantly greater in FYM + RDF + gypsum treatment followed by FYM + RDF and 180 m(3) ha(-1) of PBSW.","Deshpande, A.

It has been assumed that enhanced plant growth and reduced soil erodibility following the application of gel polymers results from increased soil macro-aggregate content and stability. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of gel polymer on soil aggregates following the application of different N fertilizers. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of a gel polymer application, named sodium polyacrylate (PAAS), with different N-fertilizers on soil aggregate size distribution and stability of three typical soils (aeolian sandy soil, loessial soil and Lou soil) on loess plateau in China. PAAS was used at 4 concentrations of 0, 0.8, 2 and 5 g kg(-1)soil and five different N fertilizer treatments were applied as none, urea, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate. A concentration of N 260 mg kg(-1) was added into the soil of all N fertilizer treatments. The dry and water-stable aggregate size distributions were determined by dry-sieving and wet-sieving methods, respectively. Mass fractal dimension (Dm) was used to characterize soil aggregate-size distributions. The results showed that with increase in PAAS content > 0.25 mm soil aggregates (R-0.25), mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) were all significantly increased while aggregate deterioration rate (AD) and Dm were reduced. The effect of N fertilizer on soil aggregates was not obvious, however, each of them reduced the effect of PAAS on improving soil aggregate stability and urea effect was least. The results could provide efficient information to improve soil aggregate stability and enhance crop planting and reduce soil erosion.","Feng, Hao; Li, Longguo; Liu, Chao; Wu, Pute; Zhuang, Wenhua",,10,2012,,,

The experimental design was randomized block and split plot with five treatments (doses: 0, 9, 18, 27 and 36 Mg ha(-1) of residue) and two soil layers (0.00 to 0.10 and 0. 10 to 0.20 m). It was evaluated the same type of soil on a native forest adjacent to the experimental area. It was analyzed the size distribution of water stable aggregates, the average diameter, the geometric mean diameter, aggregates larger than 2 mm and SOC. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (F test) following a randomized complete block design with split-plot (5 x 2 layers). The treatment means were compared by Tukey test at 5% probability and the average of the layers were compared by F test at 5% probability. The data collected in the forest soil were used only as a reference soil in natural state and therefore were not considered as a factor of variation in the analysis of variance. The values of aggregation index with the soil organic carbon stock were subjected to Pearson correlation (p <= 0.05). The effect of residual doses of guava seeds on the soil organic carbon from 0.00 to 0.20 m of soil layer was evaluated by regression analysis. The treatments did not differ in relation to soil aggregation; however, SOC was directly related to the amount of residues applied to the soil. There was significant positive correlation between aggregation index and SOC. The application of residues from guava seeds provided an improvement of soil quality.","Centurion, Jose Frederico; Kuhnen, Fernando; Seben Junior, Getulio de Freitas; Sylvestre, Thiago de Barros; de Almeida, Cinara Xavier",,33,2011,,,

Although efforts have been undertaken to reduce soil and water losses from slope land used for citrus production, information on the effects of management practices on soil fertility indices is either limited or nonexistent. This study was conducted to compare the effects of 10 years of various management practices, citrus intercropped with white clover (WC), citrus mulched with straw (SM), citrus intercropped with contour hedgerows (CH), citrus orchard land with impermeable membrane (IM), and citrus intercropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum) and peanut (Arachris hypogaea) (WP), as treatments on soil fertility indices with that of the conventional citrus management (CM). Results showed that the soil organic carbon, total and available nitrogen, available potassium, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at the 0-5 cm depth were higher for the WC and SM treatments than the CM treatment. There was also spatial variation in soil fertility along slopes of the WC and SM treatments. The soil total and available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents at both the 0-5 and 5-20 cm depths were higher for the CH and IM treatments than the CM treatment. The average soil available nitrogen and available potassium contents were higher for the WP treatment than the CM treatment, but the WP treatment had little effect on the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and water-stable aggregate (> 0.25 mm) contents. These suggested that white clover intercropping and straw mulching were the most effective approaches to improve soil fertility in citrus orchard land of the Three Gorges area.","Dian-Ming, Wu; Li-Zhong, Xia; Lin-Zhang, Yang; Shi-Xue, Yin; Yuan-Chun, Yu",,21,2011,,,

Greater understanding of how climatic variability affects net CO2 exchange [i.e. net ecosystem exchange (NEE)] of grazed grasslands is important to adapt grassland management and reduce risks of carbon losses. Since 2002, we continuously measured NEE (i.e. eddy covariance technique) on an upland grassland site (7 ha), divided in two paddocks grazed by heifers (intensive: 1 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), 213 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and extensive: 0.5 LSU ha(-1) yr(-1), no fertilization). For years with dry and warm growing seasons (i.e. 2003, 2005 and 2008), absolute annual NEE was higher in the intensive paddock compared with the extensive paddock. The opposite was observed during years of ample seasonal rainfall and soil moisture (i.e. 2004, 2006 and 2007). Contrasted management led to two distinct plant communities being different in leaf area index (LAI), soil bulk density and soil water holding capacity. Differences in annual NEEs could thus be assigned to interactions between in carbon and water fluxes during dry and wet growth periods. Dry growth periods led to a reduction in weekly gross primary productivity (GPP) in the extensively managed paddock, whereas the GPP was maintained in the intensive paddock. In turn, during wet growth periods, GPP was similar in both paddocks, whereas N amendment and frequent defoliation significantly increased ecosystem respiration in the intensive paddock, presumably through a higher heterotrophic respiration following on a better C substrate quality and availability (rhizodeposition and senescent fine roots). In the extensive paddock, where plant cover was denser (reducing soil temperature) and less decomposable, C losses through heterotrophic respiration were comparatively smaller under wet conditions. Our results demonstrate that grassland subjected to a moderately intensive management could be more resilient in terms of carbon storage during drought and heat waves, presumably because of a trade-off between heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration.","Guix, Noelle; Klumpp, Katja; Soussana, Jean-Francois; Tallec, Tiphaine",,17,2011,,,

Agroforestry systems (AFs) mimic characteristics of natural ecosystems such as multistrata canopy and deep rooting and may minimize the consequences of these changes by providing soil protection and maintenance of conditions similar to those under natural vegetation. This study evaluates the physical properties of a Luvisol at a site where since 1997 alternative agro-forestry systems (AFs) (agrosilvipasture-AGP and silvipasture-SILV), conventional crop management (CCM) and natural vegetation (NV) have been maintained. Undisturbed soil cores were collected in 2005 and submitted to a range of matric suction for which soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (Q) and soil water content (theta) were determined. Water retention and penetration resistance were used to determine the least limiting water range (LLWR) and the slope of the soil water retention curve at its inflection point (S-value). Particle size, total organic carbon (TOC) and particle density were determined using the disturbed soil samples. Water retention and porosity followed the sequence NV>SILV>CCM>AGP. The AFs studied (AGP and SILV) improved or maintained soil physical quality when compared to NV with no significant differences between the S-values of 0.044, 0.042 and 0.050, respectively. However, the S-value of 0.035 for CCM indicates that this management was unable to maintain soil physical quality on the same levels as AFs and NV. The decrease of LLWR with BD occurred for all treatments, and the BD at a maximum effect (LLWR=0) which is called the critical BD (BD(c)), was, respectively, 1.69, 1.62, 1.56 and 1.56 Mg m(-3) for AGP, SILV, NV and CCM. The larger values of LLWR for AFs (AGP and SILV) are similar to the value for NV, with associated superior aeration, matric suction and reduced resistance to penetration by roots. Indices such as LLWR and S-value were suitably sensitive and could be used in future research, but it is important to identify other potential indices for these situations that can show how quickly changes in soil quality may occur.

At the same time, it is also an important process of carbon sequestration. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effects of different land use patterns on soil aggregate stability and the distribution of organic carbon in different aggregate fractions in order to prove that the different land use patterns enhance soil aggregate stability. Five kinds of soil samples were collected from the hilly area of western Sichuan under different land use patterns, such as abandoned farmlands, eucalyptus plantations, Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards. The results demonstrated that the five land use patterns had high proportions of aggregates at the size of > 2 mm after dry sieving, and had high proportions of aggregates at the size of < 0.5 mm after wet sieving. The aggregation abilities of the soils were significantly different depending on land use patterns. Water-stable aggregate stability was highest in the Chinese fir plantations, followed by eucalyptus plantations and tea plantations. Water-stable aggregate stability was the lowest in loquat orchards and abandoned farmlands. Except for coarse particle, soil particle contents of the same size were affected according to the different land use patterns. As the size of aggregates decreased, the organic carbon content of the soil aggregates in tea plantations increased after a decrease, and then reduced again. However, the organic carbon contents of soil aggregates in other land uses increased continuously with the decreasing size of aggregates. Organic carbon content of the soil aggregates was strongly increased in land areas that had been converted from abandoned farmland to Chinese fir plantations, tea plantations and loquat orchards, while it was decreased when abandoned farmland was converted to eucalyptus plantations. The results provided the basis of implementation of returning farmland to forest and the process of carbon sequestration in the study areas.","Shu-Qin, He; Ting-Xuan, Li; Yong-Dong, Wang; Zi-Cheng, Zheng",,10,2011,,,

Undisturbed soil cores were taken from two separate fields in consecutive years at an identical stage in the crop rotation. We measured soil organic carbon (OC), soil microbial biomass carbon (BC), and hot-water extractable carbon (C(hot)). Water retention, air permeability and gas diffusivity were determined at -100 hPa in both years and for a range of water potentials in one of the years. The continued addition of animal manure had increased OC, BC, and C(hot) compared with the soil receiving only mineral fertilizer. Soil under treatment OF had larger porosity than that from treatment MF. Treatment P eliminated this difference and significantly reduced the volume of macropores. This interaction between soil organic matter content and mechanical impact was also reflected in the gas diffusion data. Specific air permeability was mainly influenced by mechanical treatment. Modelling the diffusion data normalized to the inter-aggregate pore space showed no significant treatment effects on pore-connectivity, although there was a tendency of more water blockage in soil under treatment MF. More studies are needed to confirm this interpretation. Our studies indicate that organic manure increases soil porosity, but compaction reduces the related gas exchange effects to the level of compacted soils receiving mineral fertilizer.","De Jonge, L.

A forest site was also sampled as reference of undisturbed soil. SQ was evaluated by multivariate analyses of total and particulate organic matter carbon, cation exchange capacity, mean weigh diameter and percentage of water stable aggregates of soil samples (0-20cm depth). Phospholipid fatty-acids were used to quantify microbial biomass (MB), fungi to bacteria ratio (F/B) and an indicator of bacterial stress (19:0cy/18:1 omega 7c), whereas microbial enzyme activity was determined by the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA). A gradient of SQ described by increases in the values of physical and chemical variables, was observed according to the sequence: cropped areas, irrespective to the agricultural practices < Brachiaria fallow < forest. SQ was positively correlated with MB, F/B and FDA, and negatively with 19:0cy/18:1 omega 7c. F/B was more sensitive than SQ to the agricultural practices. In the short term, the physical and chemical aspects of the quality of a kaolinitic soil is restored by Brachiaria fallow, but is not affected by tillage methods or maize+ pigeonpea intercropping. F/B ratio is a potential predictor of changes in the quality of kaolinitic soils in response to agricultural practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the density, porosity and penetration resistance of a Yellow Ultisol in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil after tilling with four agricultural implements (chisel, tandem disc harrow, offset disc harrow with 0.56 m discs, offset. disc harrow with 0.61 m discs) in one, two and three operations, using an area without tillage as control. Data of soil bulk density and porosity were analyzed by classical statistics and penetration resistance by geostatistics using a grid given by the width of the equipment and reaching depth of 0.40 M. The effect of tillage had little influence on the evaluated properties. Higher bulk density values were detected in the 0.10-0.20 m layer only for all tilling devices. Porosity varied according to tilling, i.e., values were highest in the untilled soil and lower in soil that was chisel-tilled and harrowed with 0.61 m offset discs; porosity was lowest in the 0.20-0.30 m layer. The values of penetration resistance were adequate at the reaching depth of each equipment and high in the layers underneath, except in chisel-tilled soil.","Cortez, Jorge Wilson; Dias de Moura, Marcelo Rubens; Nagahama, Hideo de Jesus; Olszevski, Nelci; da Silva Alves, Aline Dantas",,35,2011,,,

Worldwide interest in conservation tillage is increasing, because conventional tillage adversely impacts the long-term quality of the soil and its vulnerability to erosion. No-till agriculture minimizes adverse impacts of an intensive arable land use. In some cases, occasional tillage is used as a means of weed or pathogen control. Therefore, this study was conducted in eastern Ohio to examine soil quality as affected by occasional tillage, i.e. disk plowed every 3-4 years, within a long-term no-till agroecosystem. The study compared the soil characteristics between two fields, both under corn (Zea mays L.) at the time of the study. Soil properties were studied for three depths of 0-6, 6-12, and 12-18 cm. Compared with the continuous no-till field, the field under occasional tillage had significantly higher bulk density of 1.45 versus 1.31 gcm(-3), and somewhat higher soil penetration resistance of 1.77 versus 1.56 MPa. Also, compared with the no-till field, the field under occasional tillage had significantly lower water stable aggregate of 475 versus 834 gkg(-1), mean weight diameter of 1.4 versus 3.4 mm, field moisture capacity of 293 versus 360 gkg(-1), equilibrium infiltration rate of 2.0 versus 6.7 mm min(-1), and cumulative infiltration of 353.4 versus 1,211.8 mm. The field under occasional tillage had somewhat lower soil organic carbon of 16.0 versus 19.2 gkg(-1), soil water sorptivity of 16.3 versus 36.5 mm min(-0.5), and transmissivity of 2.1 versus 4.9 mm min(-1). The occasional tillage had no effect on the soil shear strength. In general, the effect of tillage on soil properties decreased with increase in soil depth. Also corn yields were compared between the two agroecosystems. Compared with the no-till field, the field under occasional tillage had significantly lower grain moisture content of 22.4 versus 28.2%, and somewhat lower wet stover biomass of 14.6 versus 20.2 Mg ha(-1), wet corn ear yield of 10.0 versus 11.4 Mg ha(-1), and dry grain yield of 8.2 versus 9.4 Mg ha(-1). As contrasted with earlier studies which were conducted under controlled research plots, this study was conducted under on-farm conditions.","Lal, R.; Owens, L. B.; Stavi, I.",,31,2011,,,

However, an extensive European review demonstrated that in practice this is not always true. This study aims to compare the status of soil and water properties between separate fields managed in either an organic or a conventional manner. Soil samples were collected from 16 pairs of farms, throughout England, with both arable and grass fields within each pair on similar soil type. Chemical (nutrients, pesticides, herbicides) and physical (aggregate stability, field capacity, shear strength, soil organic matter, infiltration rates) soil properties were measured in four main soil texture classes in organic and conventional fields. The physical soil properties varied significantly between the different classes of texture and land use. The heavier textured soils have significantly higher soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregate stability and shear strength. The coarse-textured soils have significantly lower field capacity moisture contents. The grassland has a significantly higher level of SOC, field capacity moisture content, aggregate stability and soil shear strength. However, there were no significant differences between organic and conventional treatments for any of the soil physical properties measured. There were fewer traces of agrochemicals in the soil water from the organic fields compared with the conventionally managed fields. The conventional arable fields had higher levels of total inorganic nitrogen than the other land uses and treatments. There was evidence to show that infiltration rates were significantly higher on organically managed grassland soils (7.6 mm/h) than conventionally managed grassland (2.5 mm/h) with lower stocking rates. The results suggest that improved grassland management, whether organic or conventional, could reduce predicted runoff by 28%.","Godwin, R. J.; Hathaway-Jenkins, L.

Although enzyme activities and water stable aggregates have been identified as measurable soil quality parameters for early responses to changes in soil management, the literature lacks information on those parameters for grazing systems with agroforestry buffers. The objective of this study was to examine the activities of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase, the percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA) and soil organic carbon and nitrogen as soil quality parameters for grazed pasture and row-crop systems. The study consisted of four management treatments: grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row-crop (RC). The WSA was determined by wet sieving method while the enzyme activities were colorimetrically quantified using a spectrophotometer in laboratory assays. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents were also determined. Two soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed for all treatments. The row-crop treatment showed significantly lower activities compared to all other treatments for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes along with lower WSA. The dehydrogenase activities were significantly higher in GP treatment compared to RC treatment. The FDA hydrolase activities were not significantly different among treatments. Surface soil revealed higher enzyme activities and higher WSA than the subsurface soil. The treatment by depth interaction was significant for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes. The soil organic carbon and total nitrogen data strongly supported the results of enzyme activities and WSA. Implications can be made that perennial vegetation enhances organic matter accumulation in the soil, has minimum disturbance to the soil and will have positive impacts on the ecosystem.

New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or maintain soil functionality in order to achieve a sustainable agriculture. This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of two olive mill wastes (olive leaves and “alperujo”) on soil properties and soil erosion in a rain fed olive grove in SE Spain. After three years experiment, oil mill wastes application significantly improved physical and chemical properties of the studied soil with respect to control. The organic matter content, bulk density and porosity were increased, which confirmed the interactions of these properties. Available water capacity increased with olive leaves but decreased when applied “alperujo”. With respect to erosion, after simulated rainfall experiments it was found that the oil mill wastes contributed to increase the roughness and the interception of raindrops, delaying runoff generation and enhancing the infiltration of rainwater. Treatment with oil mill wastes contributed to a reduction in runoff generation and soil losses compared to bare soil, especially when applied olive leaves. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about the interactive effects of soil fertility management and soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and SOM dynamics in tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed arable systems were compared to a long-term green fallow system representing a relatively undisturbed reference. Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters. Factor analysis showed that 35.3% of the total sample variation in aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was explained by earthworm parameters, and 25.5% by termite parameters. Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome. The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools than differences in termite populations.

The long-term effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil properties and crop yields were investigated in annual double cropping system of winter wheat-summer maize in the Gaocheng in Hebei, North China Plain over a 11-year period (1998-2009). Long-term NT significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil organic matter, available N and Pin the top 10 cm by 16.1%, 31.0% and 29.6% as compared to CT treatment. Mean percentage of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm, +8.1%) and macroporosity (>60 mu m, +43.3%) was also enhanced statistically (P < 0.05) in the 0-30 cm soil layer. Winter wheat and summer maize yields tended to be 3.5% and 1.4% higher under NT than under CT, particularly in the dry years, suggesting that the change in soil physical properties, soil fertility and moisture has provided a better environment for crop development. These improvements in soil properties and yields are of considerable importance for the degraded soils in semiarid North China Plain, as well as for food security, sustainable agriculture and carbon storage in the annual double cropping areas of China.

Primary forest and farm fields deforested between 1930 and 2000 were sampled along a chronosequence on two parent materials in western Kenya. Two traditional long-term management systems were sampled: continuous low-input maize (Zea mays; Co), and kitchen garden (Ki) polyculture with organic inputs. Physical, biological, and chemical SQ indicators were measured. Degradation in Co followed exponential decay trends for most indicators (organic matter, active C, water-stable aggregates, available water capacity, electrical conductivity, CEC, pH, Ca, Mg and Zn), as well as for yield. Organic matter quality declined linearly, suggesting degradation will continue. For both parent materials and most indicators degradation of 25-93% below initial values resulted, but with <= 40% further drop below initial values and for more indicators under Co than Ki. P. Zn and possibly K accumulated over time under Ki. The extent of degradation was influenced by parent material. In conclusion, a basic accessible set of SQ indicators was successfully used to describe soil degradation dynamics under cultivation. Results suggest that regular organic inputs can significantly reduce degradation, especially of nutrient retention and soil structure, after forest conversion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
