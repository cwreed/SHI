  abstract = {{Upland blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Read.) requires acidic and organic
   matter rich soils for its cultivation. Recently, the raised bed
   cultivation system has widely been used for blueberry cultivation, but
   it has a potential to cause nitrogen (N) losses via leaching and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emission especially with high rate of N application. We
   investigated the effects of organic amendments on N losses; via leaching
   ammonium ({[}image omitted]) and nitrate ({[}image omitted]) and N2O
   emission under acid soil conditions. The treatments were (i) ammonium
   sulfate application (AS), (ii) AS with peat moss (AS + PM), and (iii) AS
   with sawdust compost (AS + SD). A container (surface area: 47 cm x 40 cm
   = 0.188 m2) experiment to simulate raised bed cultivation system using
   an ochric Cambisol was conducted at Chiba University, Japan, during 2008
   and 2009. A blueberry plant in each container received N fertilizer
   three times: 14.8, 23.8, and 14.8 g N m-2 in July 2008, March, and July
   2009, respectively. Incorporation of peat moss and sawdust compost with
   ferrous sulfate effectively decreased soil pH to its optimal ranges
   (4.0-5.2) and resulted in increased growth and yield of blueberry (berry
   yield of 2009: 93, 285, and 348 g plant-1 in AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD
   treatment, respectively) due to increased soil porosity and consequently
   enhanced plant root biomass. Concurrently, the AS + SD treatment
   resulted in the least N losses, followed by AS + PM and AS treatment
   both through leaching and N2O emission. The emitted N2O amount over
   about two-year blueberry cultivation were 1.28, 0.80, and 0.58 g N m-2
   for AS, AS + PM, and AS + SD treatments, respectively. These results
   indicated that application of organic amendments decreased N losses to
   the environment most likely due to increased plant N uptake, microbial N
   immobilization, and consequent reduction in nitrification,
   denitrification, and leaching.}},

  abstract = {{Organic inputs were used for 10 years on a French vineyard topsoil to
   improve structural stability and thus to protect against erosion. The
   three types of organic inputs (mulches) included: conifer compost, CC
   (100 m3 ha-1 every 3 years); conifer bark, CB (300 m3 ha-1 every 5
   years); and cereal straw, S (10 t ha-1 every 2 years). The other two
   types of organic inputs were cover crops of clover (C) and fescue (F).
   The impacts of these organic inputs on soil organic carbon (SOC)
   content, wettability (capillary rise and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS)) and structural stability were studied. The SOC
   content was twice as large in the CC, C and F topsoils (SOC content of
   2.56-3.24\%) as in the reference (R) topsoil (SOC content of 1.39\%).
   Both apparent contact angle (theta) and surface OH:C mass ratio
   indicated that the R and S topsoils were hydrophilic (theta of 27.4-33.4
   degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 3.20-4.41), whereas the CB, C and F
   topsoils were partially hydrophobic (theta of 69.1-79.8 degrees, surface
   OH:C ratio of 1.36-2.86), and the CC topsoil had intermediate values
   (theta of 46.9 degrees, surface OH:C ratio of 2.43-2.81). Moreover, the
   greater the theta value, the smaller the water sorptivity value and the
   greater the proportion of water-stable aggregates, Ag(w). The increase
   in SOC content had beneficial effects on Ag(w), particularly for the
   partially hydrophobic C and F topsoils (Ag(w) of 22.3-44.5\%) against
   the hydrophilic R and S topsoils (Ag(w) of 8.2-12.7\%). Development of
   hydrophobicity, correlated with the decrease in the surface OH:C ratio
   and the increase in the C-O, C-N proportion on surface C, should be
   attributed to humified organic matter or/and to plant and microbial
   polysaccharides. As the XPS and aggregate stability data describe soil
   physical processes at small scales (nm to mm), we suggest an
   experimental and modelling framework for upscaling these results for
   practical improvement and management of vineyard soils.}},

   and soil suppressiveness of the Rhizoctonia solani-L. sativa
   pathosystem.
   Results showed that many soil properties were influenced by management

   SOC pool and fluxes in a watershed, land use changes and soil erosion
   are factors of importance. The differences in SOC and its fractions
   among different land uses can help understand the process of soil carbon
   dynamics. A study was conducted in Typic Ustochrepts of Northwest India
   to understand the impact of forest, grassland, agricultural and eroded
   lands on aggregate stability and SOC fractions. The undisturbed soil
   aggregates were sampled from different land uses in a watershed in
   Shiwaliks of lower Himalayas. The aggregate stability was determined by
   shaking the pre-saturated aggregates under water and by single simulated
   raindrop technique. The SOC, labile carbon, hot-water soluble carbon,
   particulate organic carbon and aggregate associated organic carbon were
   determined in aggregates of different sizes as well as in the bulk
   soils. The water stability of aggregates expressed as mean weight
   diameter (MWD) and stability index (SI(SRT)) was highest in surface
   soils (0-15 cm) of grasslands followed by forest, agricultural and
   eroded lands. The WSA > 2 mm (water stable aggregates > 2 mm) were
   highest (17.3\%) in grasslands and lowest (0.85\%) in eroded lands. The
   eroded soils had 2.2, 7.4 and 3.4 times higher amount of
   micro-aggregates (WSA < 0.25 mm) than agricultural, forest and grassland
   soils, respectively. The SOC in surface soils significantly decreased by
   27\% in forest and 45\% in agricultural land from that in grassland
   soils. In subsoil (15-30 cm), the SOC in eroded, agricultural and
   grasslands was statistically similar. The SOC stock in the subsoil
   (15-100 cm) was of significance. The grassland soils could store 41 Mg
   ha(-1) SOC stock compared to 31 Mg ha(-1) in the subsurface layer. This
   difference widened in forestland, where subsoil contained 73.4\% of
   total SOC stock in 100 cm soil profile. Among all the SOC fractions
   studied, labile carbon was mostly affected by erosion and was 91.6\%
   lower in eroded than in grassland soils. The magnitude of aggregate
   associated organic carbon decreased with aggregate size in all the land
   uses. Among the SOC fractions, the aggregate stability under simulated
   raindrop impact could better be explained (R (2) = 0.78) by hot water
   soluble carbon whereas the water stability of aggregate could better be
   explained (R (2) = 0.69) by particulate organic carbon.}},

   Cultivation regimes with tillage, field traffic, and inorganic

   availability, but this was accompanied by increased soil compaction and
   reductions in most of the other soil properties analysed. Relative to
   the nursery NR cultivation, creeping-legume cultivation increased soil C

   relatively higher under the cover crops (mucuna, stylosanthes and

   under the cover crops than they were under natural fallow. Also, soils
   under the cover crops had higher total porosity, water infiltration
   rates and moisture storage than they did under natural fallow. Weed
   cover, 115 days after planting maize, was significantly lower in plots
   previously under Mucuna pruriens than it was under natural fallow,
   Stylosanthes guianensis and Mimosa invisa. There was a negative linear
   correlation between cover crop biomass and weed density (R(2) =
   0.593-0.805). Grain and stover yields of maize were higher under Mucuna
   pruriens than they were under natural fallow (138 and 70 per cent
   higher, respectively). Burning of the natural fallow resulted in greater
   weed growth than when the material was worked into the soil (41 and 8
   per cent, respectively). Grain yield was significantly greater under
   mucuna than it was under natural fallow (3.1 and 1.3tha(-1),
   respectively).}},

   regions has a great potential to increase carbon sequestration and
   improve soil quality. Our objective was to investigate the changes in
   the soil carbon pool and soil properties of surface soil (0-15 cm) under
   different types of rehabilitation management. Our study was done in the
   short-term (7 years) and long-term (32 years) desertification control
   sites in a marginal oasis of northwest China. The different management
   treatments were: (1) untreated shifting sand land as control; (2)
   sand-fixing shrubs with straw checkerboards; (3) poplar (Populus
   gansuensis) shelter forest; and (4) irrigated cropland after leveling
   sand dune. The results showed that the rehabilitation of severe sandy
   desertified land resulted in significant increases in soil organic C
   (SOC), inorganic C, and total N concentrations, as well as enhanced soil
   aggregation. Over a 7-year period of revegetation and cultivation, SOC
   concentration in the recovered shrub land, forest land and irrigated
   cropland increased by 4.1, 14.6 and 11.9 times compared to the control
   site (shifting sand land), and increased by 11.2, 17.0 and 23.0 times
   over the 32-year recovery period. Total N, labile C (KMnO4-oxidation C),
   C management index (CMI) and inorganic C (CaCO3-C) showed a similar
   increasing trend as SOC. The increased soil C and N was positively
   related to the accumulation of fine particle fractions. The accumulation
   of silt and clay, soil C and CaCO3 enhanced the formation of aggregates,
   which was beneficial to mitigate wind erosion. The percentage of >0.25
   mm dry aggregates increased from 18.0\% in the control site to
   20.0-87.2\% in the recovery sites, and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of
   water-stable aggregates significantly increased, with a range of
   0.09-0.30 mm at the recovery sites. Long-term irrigation and
   fertilization led to a greater soil C and N accumulation in cropland
   than in shrub and forest lands. The amount of soil C sequestration
   reached up to 1.8-9.4 and 7.5-17.3 Mg ha(-1) at the 0-15 cm layer over a
   7- and 32-year rehabilitation period compared to the control site,

  abstract = {{Conservation tillage and judicious use of animal manures as fertilizers
   can make significant contributions for sustainable food production in
   the twenty-first century. Identifying and understanding the many
   interactions occurring within agricultural systems is fundamental for
   accomplishing this feat. This paper synthesizes 14 years of research
   results from a study that began in the early 1990s in which researchers
   from USDA-ARS and the University of Georgia investigated cropping system
   influences on nutrient management under natural rainfall. Increases in C
   and N with no-till resulted in improved soil structure that increased
   infiltration rate and soil water availability. Biological activity as
   indicated by earthworms was greater with no-till and poultry litter
   (PL). In all but the very driest year, yields of cotton and corn
   increased on average 10-27\% with no-till and 32-42\% with combination
   of no-till and PL. On the other hand soil nutrient accumulation,
   particularly P and Zn from long-term use of poultry litter in corn
   production, reached excessive levels and could present environmental
   risks. Drainage increased in no-till raising the risk of leaching of
   nutrients into the soil profile. However, runoff decreased in no-till
   and the presence of a rye cover crop during the winter reduced the
   leaching losses of N compared to no cover crop. During cotton production
   under relative drought, no-till and poultry litter led to somewhat
   elevated dissolved phosphorus concentration in runoff, and fluometuron
   was detected in runoff and drainage while pendimethalin was not. Fecal
   indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal enterococci), and the
   hormones estradiol and testosterone were observed in drainage and runoff
   but concentrations were similar across all treatments. By conducting the
   study for an extended period under natural environmental conditions, we
   were able to highlight real risks and potentials of the contrasting
   cropping systems. While 6 out of 14 years of relative drought might have
   limited the water quality response of treatments, such droughts are
   common features of the weather pattern in the region. Even then, use of
   no-till as the predominant tillage system was supported by improved
   yields. Fertilizer management, especially crop N need-based use of PL,
   requires closer monitoring to insure that production advantages of
   no-till and poultry litter are not offset by concerns with environmental
   risks. Long-term research requires sustained resource inputs to answer
   critical questions of environmental risk and emerging unknown issues.}},

  abstract = {{Semi-arid areas comprise a large portion of the world's agricultural
   crop land. These areas are characterised by high temperature and low
   rainfall which hinders soil organic matter accumulation. The reported
   experiments were designed to study the effect of soil organic matter
   (SOM) from green manure crops on soil physical properties in two
   contrasting soils, sandy clay loam and loamy sand under the severe
   conditions of high temperature and low rainfall that exist in the
   eastern wheat belt of Western Australia. To remove soil physical and
   chemical constraints, the soils were deep ripped to 0.4 m after the
   application of 2.5 t/ha of gypsum. Basal fertilizers were applied
   according to soil tests to remove possible nutrient deficiencies.
   Cereals and legume crops were incorporated by disc cultivation into the
   soils as green manure for four consecutive years. Two plant groups,
   cereals and legumes were used to provide green manure. Oat (Avena
   sativa) as a cereal with high C:N ratio (95) and either faba bean (Vicia
   faba), field pea (Pisum sativum) or lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) were
   used as legumes with low C: N ratios (12 - 18). These crops were
   arranged in three treatments for each soil type consisting of different
   crop sequences. A total of between 14 and 20 t/ha of green material was
   incorporated into the top soil over four years. All treatments increased
   soil organic matter significantly compared to the initial soil values
   but no significant differences between treatments (crop sequences) were
   observed. Water stable aggregates and soil bulk density were
   significantly improved by all treatments but no significant differences
   were observed between treatments. Soil water infiltration was not
   significantly increased by the green manure treatments after ripping and
   gypsum addition, though it was significantly different between
   treatments. The SOM increased from around 1.28 to 1.96\%, well below the
   critical value suggested in the literature for more humid areas to
   sustain healthy soil, and not as high as expected from the high quantity
   of green material returned to the soil. However, the levels of organic
   carbon increase were comparable with those predicted from a CSIRO carbon
   model. These results point to the dominant role of soil and weather
   conditions in the low rainfall cropping zone of Western Australia in
   limiting the build-up of soil organic matter content, regardless of
   amount or composition of green manure applied.}},

   no-till with corn-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) conventional
   tillage with wheat/soybean sequence (CT-S) at Galvez: and a) no-till
   with corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (NT-R), and b) no-till with

   cm were applied using tension infiltrometers with the aim of obtaining
   soil hydraulic conductivity measurements (K(0), K(1.5), and K(3)), and
   several hydraulic parameters (pore size, pore number, effective
   macroporosity, conducting macroporosity (epsilon((a,b))), water flow and
   water flow decrease). Undisturbed soil cores were collected to determine
   water release curves (WRC) and soil bulk density (Db). The total
   macroporosity (Ma) and pore size frequency curve were determined from
   the fitted model of the WRC. Macropore connectivity was calculated using
   epsilon((a,b)) and Ma. In Galvez, the Db values. K at all tensions, the
   number of effective pores, the mean pore radius and the effective
   macroporosity were significantly higher for NT-R. The conducting and
   total macroporosity values were similar in NT-R and CT-S, but the pores
   had better continuity in NT-R. In Videla, only K(0) and K(1.5) showed
   statistical differences in favor of NT-R. This treatment also had a
   greater number of effective pores, and higher effective, conducting and
   total macroporosity values, apart from the overall better pore
   connectivity. There were no significant differences between the NT-R and
   CT-S for Db and K(3). The evaluated indicators determined that the pore
   network characteristics are affected not only by tillage system, but
   also by the crops chosen for the rotation. When used jointly, tension
   infiltrometers and water release curves can be very useful tools for

   (SOC) is affected by changes in the capacity of the mineral matrix to
   hold and protect SOC that are brought about by agriculture. It is well
   established that microaggregates provide much of the capacity of soils
   to protect SOC. In this study, a loss of the capacity of soils to
   sequester SOC following agriculture was established by comparing samples
   of an Alfisol, in (1) its virgin condition, (2) following relatively
   light treatments for agriculture, (3) following conventional cultivation
   for similar to 120 years, and (4) after 18 years under zero tillage
   following similar to 100 years under conventional cultivation. It
   appears that material has been lost from clay and silt fractions
   relative to sand-size material. Microaggregates in all of the cultivated
   soils studied were less stable to the `chemical hammer' of osmotic
   pressure than those in the virgin soil. The introduction of no-till
   methods did not restore the stability of microaggregates over a period
   of 18 years following similar to 100 years of conventional cultivation.
   Pore size distributions from mercury intrusion showed that cultivation
   always led to a decrease of pore volume in the range of pores between
   0.03 and 100 mu m.
   Transmission electron microscopy showed that a large proportion of
   microaggregates, previously composed of clay and silt-sized particles,
   had disintegrated as a result of conventional soil management over the
   long-term. Surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy and
   photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy both showed that intimate
   associations between fine and coarse material have been broken down by
   intensive soil management practices. The effects on particle size
   distributions by chemical disruption with either or both hydrogen
   peroxide and acid ammonium oxalate, and also with alkaline sodium
   hexametaphosphate, suggested that microaggregates are stabilised by a
   combination of organic matter, poorly ordered minerals and clay
   self-associations, regardless of the agricultural history of the soils.
   Microaggregates appear to be broken down by agriculture through the loss
   of any of these aggregating agents.
   The capacity of soils to form microaggregates will also be affected by
   loss of soil. It appears that both soil, as a whole, and also clay- and
   silt-size material, selectively, has been lost through wind erosion
   following prolonged cultivation. Agriculture has led to a decrease in
   the capacity of the Alfisol to resequester SOC that is effectively
   irreversible by farming practices. Even so, the resilience of the soil
   appeared to be improved by changes in farming practices. (C) 2010

   Microbial biomass carbon was also greater in grasslands than in

   Bacterial and nitrogen fixing communities in croplands and grasslands

  abstract = {{Soil microbiology is a key factor in soil organic matter decomposition,
   and nutrient turnover and availability in agricultural soils, which can
   be markedly influenced by management practices, such as placement of
   crop residues, tillage and crop rotation. The present field study was
   designed as long-term experiment in an experimental farm located in the
   suburb of Shanghai, China, to study the effects of agricultural
   management practices on community composition of soil fungi and soil
   structure. Treatments included burning (crop residues burnt vs. not
   burnt), tillage (tillage vs. no-tillage) and crop rotation (wheat-corn
   vs. wheat-soybean). The experiment started in June 2001 and soil samples
   were collected in March, July and November 2003, i.e. 2 years after
   establishment. Abundance, diversity and species composition of fungi and
   soil aggregate composition were analyzed. Hypothesis 1 was that
   abundance, species richness and diversity of soil fungi would increase
   in treatments with no-tillage, crop residue retention and wheat-legume
   rotation compared to tillage, burning and wheat-corn rotation, and
   Hypothesis 2 that size-distribution of stable aggregates would increase
   with the diversity of soil fungi. A total of 27 species of fungi of 15
   genera were isolated. As the Hypothesis 1, overall soil fungal species
   richness (6.3 +/- 0.4), diversity (2.2 +/- 0.1) and total species number
   (26) in no-tillage significantly exceeded the species richness (4.4 +/-
   0.3), diversity (1.7 +/- 0.1) and total species number (21) in tillage
   treatments, respectively. However, the effects of tillage depended on
   soil depth and were most pronounced deeper in soil (10-15 cm soil
   depth). The Hypothesis 2 was supported by the results: The content of
   large macro-aggregates (>2000 mu m) (295 +/- 94 g/kg soil) in no-tillage
   treatments significantly exceeded that (99 +/- 25 g/kg soil) in tillage
   treatments in 10-15 cm but not in 0-5 cm soil depth, and coincidentally,
   soil fungal species richness (6.3 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3 +/- 0.1)
   in 10-15 and also the species richness (6.5 +/- 0.5) and diversity (2.3
   +/- 0.1) in 5-10 cm in no-tillage treatments significantly exceeded the
   species richness (4.2 +/- 0.7) and diversity (1.6 +/- 0.3) in 10-15 cm
   and the species richness (4.3 +/- 0.4) and diversity (1.7 +/- 0.2) in
   5-10 cm in tillage treatments, respectively, but the differences were
   also not in 0-5 cm soil depth. The results suggest that no-tillage
   favours fungi and that a more diverse fungal community beneficially
   affects the formation of large soil macro-aggregates. Further, the
   results indicate that species richness and diversity of cultivable fungi
   are useful and distinctive parameters reflecting the status and
   functioning of the soil fungal community. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   furthermore reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity compared with a

   homogeneous compared to the plots with OMW application, which fostered
   the generation of heterogeneous flux fields including preferential flow

   on previously cultivated cropland provide an opportunity for greater

   greatest increases in SOC sequestration rates are associated with most
   recently established prairies oil cultivated land, where SOC was the
   most depleted, due to the destruction of soil aggregate. The study was
   conducted in Jasper and Warren counties in Iowa, from 2005 to 2008.
   Soils in both Counties were formed in loess under native vegetation of
   tallgrass prairie. There were three reconstructed prairie sites varying
   in establishment year-1993, 1998, 2003; a row crop production site
   tinder no-tillage; and a prairie remnant site. All soil and plant
   sampling plots were located on summit, midslope, and toe-slope
   positions. Results show that time since establishment and slope position
   had a significant impact on SOC sequestration rates in the top 15 cm (6
   in) soil depth only. In the summit position, the greatest SOC
   sequestration rates were observed in the youngest prairie at 2.15 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1) (0.96 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)), and decreased to near equilibrium
   after approximately eight years. Additionally, SOC was shown to increase
   linearly at a rate of 0.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.33 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)) since
   prairie establishment during the 14-year period. In the toe-slope
   position, SOC sequestration rates were substantially lower at 0.59 Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1) (0.26 m ac(-1) yr(-1)). Furthermore, increases in SOC
   sequestration rates coincided with increases in water stable
   aggregate-associated carbon (C) in 0.25 to 2 mm (0.01 to 0.08 in) size
   fractions. This occurred in the youngest reconstructed prairie (2003) in
   the summit and in the midslope positions on prairies reconstructed in
   1998 and 1993. This suggests that the mechanisms of soil aggregate
   formation aid in stabilizing SOC, which is significantly affected by

   was an Calc(ar)i-Endohypogleyic Luvisol (LVg-n-w-cc), clay loam on sandy
   light loam, with a pF(KCI) of 7.6, humus content of 28.6 g kg(-1), K(2)O
   - 134 mg kg(-1), and P(2)O(5) - 266 mg kg(-1). Straw incorporation had
   no significant influence on bulk density, penetration resistance and
   quantity of earthworms, but significantly reduced the amount of the
   smallest <0.25 mm aggregates. No significant differences of bulk density
   vs. CP were obtained in reduced autumn tillage - SP, and SL, while in
   reduced spring tillage systems - SR, GMR and NT significant changes were
   observed only in the first year of experiment at 3-13 cm depth. Soil
   penetration resistance increased in undisturbed soil layers. In SP it
   increased from 12 cm depth, in SL from 9 cm depth and in SR and GM R
   from 6 cm depth, while in NT it became higher from the very soil
   surface. SR, GMR and NT increased the number and biomass of earthworms
   and decreased the amount of the smallest <0.25 mm soil aggregates.
   Significant differences in soil aggregate size distribution and
   stability were found already in the first year. Reduced and no-tillage
   significantly increased the amount of water stable aggregates in both
   0-15 cm and 15-25 cm soil layers compared to deep ploughing.}},

  abstract = {{Many soils in the semiarid Mediterranean Ebro Valley of Spain are prone
   to physical and chemical degradation due to their silty texture, low
   organic matter content, and presence of carbonates, gypsum or other
   soluble salts. Rainfed agriculture on these soils is also hindered by
   the scarcity of water. No-tillage can increase plant-available water and
   soil organic matter, thus helping overcome most factors limiting crop
   production in this area. Our objective was to determine how
   conventional- and no-tillage practices affected soil physical quality
   indicators and water availability in an on-farm study in the Ebro
   Valley. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 5-, 5 to 15-, and 15 to
   30-cm depth increments within adjacent farmer-managed conventional- and
   no-tillage fields in 2007 and 2008. Both fields were managed for
   continuous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) production. The soil at both
   sites is a silt loam (Haplic Calcisol). Aggregate-size distribution and
   stability, soil water retention characteristics, organic carbon, and
   total carbonates were determined in 2007. Pore-size distribution was
   estimated from the water retention curve. Penetration resistance, soil
   bulk density and field water content during the entire crop growing
   season were measured for both fields in 2008. Aggregate dry mean weight
   diameter and stability in water were 1.2 and 2.2 times greater,
   respectively, under no-tillage than conventional tillage due to reduced
   mechanical disturbance and increased soil organic carbon content. Bulk
   density was 1.12 times greater (P < 0.1) under no-tillage only in the
   0-5-cm depth. Two times greater penetration resistance to a depth of 15
   cm in this treatment was related to bulk density and aggregates
   stability. Field water content was greater with no-tillage than
   conventional tillage during the driest months in 2008. The volume of
   equivalent diameter pores (0.2-9 mu m) was 1.5 times higher under
   no-tillage. This increased plant-available water content and doubled
   barley production under no-tillage in 2008, which was a very dry year.
   We conclude that despite the greater penetration resistance under
   no-tillage, increased water availability as a result of improved
   structure characteristics was more important for crop yield. This
   suggests that producers should seriously consider adopting no-tillage
   practices for soil conservation in semiarid degraded areas like the one
   studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   aggregates by measuring the aggregate stability, the organic carbon
   (C(org)) and the total nitrogen (N(tot)) contents within different
   aggregate fractions, and their release of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC). Soil samples were collected from the top 0 to 10 cm of a
   long-term tillage experiment at Fuchsenbigl (Marchfeld, Austria) where
   conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and minimum tillage
   (MT) treatments were applied to a Chernozem fine sandy loam. The stable
   aggregates (1000-2000 mu m) were subject to dispersion by the soil
   aggregate stability (SAS or wet sieving) method after Kemper and Rosenau
   (1986), and the ultrasonic method of Mayer et al. (2002). Chemical
   analysis of the soil was obtained for the aggregate fractions 630-1000,
   250-630 and 63-250 mu m gathered from the ultrasonic method. Using the
   SAS method, CT and RT had the least amounts of stable aggregates (18.2\%
   and 18.9\%, respectively), whereas MT had twice as much stable
   aggregates (37.6\%). Using the ultrasonic method, MT also had the
   highest amount of water stable aggregates in all three fractions (1.5\%,
   3.7\%, and 35\%, respectively), followed by RT (1\%, 2.3\%, 32.3\%), and
   CT (0.8\%, 1.7\%, 29.1\%). For comparison, a reference soil, EUROSOIL 7
   (ES-7) was also analysed (40\%, 6.7\%, and 12.1\%). The highest amounts
   of C(org) and N(tot) were measured under MT in all three fractions, with
   8.9\%, 3.8\%, and 1.3\% for C(org), and 0.4\%, 0.3\%, and 0.1\% for
   N(tot). Apart from the fraction 630-1000 mu m, the aggregates of RT and
   CT contained <50\% of the C(org) and N(tot) values of MT. The C/N ratio
   was least favourable for CT (42.6) in the aggregate fraction 630-1000 mu
   m. The DOC release from stable aggregates after 10 min of ultrasonic
   dispersion was highest from MT soil (86.7 mg l(-1)). The values for RT
   and CT were 21\% and 25\% below this value. The results demonstrate that
   tillage type influences both aggregate stability and aggregate chemical
   composition. This research confirms that CT interferes more with the
   natural soil properties than RT and MT. Furthermore, MT has the highest
   potential to sequester C and N in this agriculturally used soil. (C)

   agriculture. Either rotation of crops with pastures (ROT) or no-till
   (NT) cropping have been proposed as alternatives to minimize the impact
   of agriculture on soil quality. The combined impact on soil properties
   of ROT and NT has not been evaluated. In this study, we report results
   of the first 12 years of a long-term experiment established on a clay
   loam soil in western Uruguay. The objective was to determine the
   influence of conventional tillage (CT) and NT on systems under
   continuous cropping (CC, two crops per year) or ROT (3.5-year annual
   crops/2.5-year pastures). Soil samples taken at the beginning of the
   experiment in 1994 and in 2004 were analyzed for organic carbon (SOC),
   total organic carbon (TSOC) and total nitrogen content (STN), and for
   water-stable aggregation (WAS). Soil loss and erodibility indicators
   were studied using microrain simulator. With 12 years, the cumulative
   carbon (C) inputs of aboveground biomass were similar between tillage,
   but C input in CC was 50\% higher than ROT. This difference was
   explained because 84\% of the pastures dry matter was consumed by
   animals. Nevertheless we estimated a higher below ground biomass in ROT
   compared to CC systems (24.9 Mg ha(-1) vs. 10.9 Mg ha(-1)). NT presented
   7\% higher SOC than CT (0-18 cm) with no differences between rotation
   systems. While all treatments declined in STN during 12 years, ROT had
   11\% and 58\% higher STN and WAS than CC systems, with a large impact of
   the pasture under CT. Runoff and erosion were minimized under NT in both
   rotations systems. Thus, including pastures in the rotation, or
   switching from CT to NT improved soil quality properties. The expected
   benefit of combining NT and ROT will likely require more years for the
   cumulative effect to be detectable in both C input and soil properties.

   estimated C and N sequestration rates were 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and
   0.04 Mg N ha(-1) year(-1) following the conversion. The large aggregate
   (> 5 mm) was the most abundant dry aggregate size fraction in both crop
   and alfalfa soils, and significant difference in the distribution of dry
   aggregates between the two land use types occurred only in the > 5 mm
   aggregate fraction. The percentage of water-stable macroaggregates (> 2,
   2-0.25 mm) and aggregate stability (mean weight diameter of water-stable
   aggregates, WMWD) were significantly higher in alfalfa soils than in
   crop soils. There was a significant linear relationship between total
   SOC concentration and aggregate parameters (mean weight diameter) for
   alfalfa soils, indicating that aggregate stability was closely
   associated with increased SOC concentration following the conversion of
   crops to alfalfa. The SOC and N concentrations and the C/N ratio were
   greatest in the > 2 mm water-stable aggregates and the smallest in the
   0.25-0.05 mm aggregates in crop and alfalfa soils. For the same
   aggregate, SOC and N concentrations in aggregate fractions increased
   with increasing total SOC and N concentrations. The result showed that
   the conversion of annual crops to alfalfa in the marginal land with
   coarse-texture soils can significantly increase SOC and N stocks, and

   carbohydrate distributions within water-stable aggregates (WSA) of
   virgin forest and pasture lands under different land uses in Alborz

   collected from depths of 0-20 cm in Typic Haploxerolls soils. The
   overall pattern indicated that the mean weight diameter (MWD) and WSA
   were greater in the virgin pasture and forest soils compared with the
   adjacent cultivated (ex-forest and ex-pasture) soils and aggregates of
   >1.0 mm size were dominant in the virgin soils, whereas the cultivated
   soils comprised aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. Distribution of
   organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbohydrates within the WSA
   showed preferential enrichment of these parameters in the macroaggregate
   fraction (4.75-1.0 mm) for the virgin soils and microaggregate fraction
   (>0.25 mm) for the exposed soils. Cultivation decreased the
   concentration of carbohydrates by 23.6\% and 20.6\% in ex-forest and

   Southern of Brazil, where they represent around 20\% of the total area.
   Deficient drainage is the most important natural characteristic of these
   soils which therefore are mainly in use for irrigated rice (Oriza
   sativa). Degradation in these soils is progressively getting stronger
   since the intensity of agricultural activities leads to a higher soil
   density, and a lower water infiltration rate. There is a growing
   interest by farmers to grow other crops such as soybean in rotation with
   (flood) irrigated rice but this degradation has become an obstacle to do
   so. This study was done with the objective to assess the soil physical
   and chemical quality of the three rice management systems (conventional,
   semi-direct and pre-germinated) most used in the region of Camaqua
   municipality, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Samples were collected
   from 21 rice farms with 2 different types of lowland soil (Albaqualf and
   Humaquepts). The soil samples were analysed for physical and chemical
   properties. Using multivariate analysis of covariance (Mancova), the
   effects of the natural variability in terms of soil clay content were
   separated from the management effects. The analysis revealed that soil
   physical and chemical properties were affected by the management
   practices adopted by farmers. The results showed that the major effect
   of the management systems was on a physical property: bulk density. An
   increase in soil density in the pre-germinated and conventional systems
   was found to be caused by a significant reduction in the volume occupied
   by micropores, an indication of structural degradation. The semi-direct
   management system, associated with less intensive tillage operations
   retained better soil conditions and a better organic matter status. The
   chemical properties significantly affected by management (total N. Ca,
   Mg, Fe, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and potential acidity {[}PA])
   all had their highest values in the semi-direct management system. This

   physical soil quality indicators (bulk density, coarse porosity,

   stability (precompression stress, compression index) of a refilled sandy
   loam originating from an Eutric Cambisol. In particular, we derived
   multiple linear regression equations to correlate precompression stress
   and compression index to soil texture, gravel content, organic carbon
   content and void ratio.
   During the 3-year observation period after restoration, bulk density and
   penetration resistance increased significantly, while coarse porosity
   decreased significantly. Nonetheless, these parameters remained in a
   range, which is considered to indicate suitable physical soil conditions
   for root growth over the entire period of observation. Precompression
   stress increased significantly in the topsoil as well as in the subsoil.
   The compression index was significantly higher in the topsoil than the
   subsoil and stayed fairly constant over the observation period.
   Precompression stress was negatively and the compression index was
   positively correlated with initial void ratio and to coarse porosity.
   Taking additional parameters into account, such as gravel content, clay
   content, silt content and organic matter content, improved the
   correlation with precompression stress. The equations derived with
   multiple linear regression analysis from our data set gave a

   nutrient losses in different soil tillage systems in a typic Acric
   Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). On five plots with the following soil
   tillage treatments were evaluated: conventional tillage and down-slope
   tillage (CMA); conventional tillage and contour seeding (CEN); tillage
   with one passage of heavy disk harrow and one passage of leveling harrow
   and contour seeding (CNiv); tillage with two passages of leveling harrow
   and contour seeding (NA) and no tillage and contour seeding (CMN). The
   soil losses were determined by the direct method during the cotton crop
   cycle, from December 2005 to June 2006. Along each runoff sampling, soil
   samples were withdrawn to quantify the losses of N, P, K and organic
   carbon (C-org) in the sediments. Decreasing soil tillage lessened the
   losses of sediments, nutrients and organic carbon, indicating that the
   CMN treatment was the most efficient. The trends for N, P, K and C-org
   losses in the sediments were similar to the soil losses. N, P and K
   varied according to the fertilizers used. The constituent with the
   highest concentration in the sediment was C in organic compounds. The
   basic infiltration rate differed among the treatments in the following
   order: CMA < CEN congruent to CNiv congruent to NA < CMN, indicating
   that tillage systems that reduced soil revolving and increased organic
   C, increased the basic infiltration rate and decreased soil erosion.}},

  abstract = {{Soil degradation and the accompanying decline in crop yields are the
   main limiting factors for the further development of agriculture on the
   Chinese Loess Plateau. A 10-year experiment was conducted in Linfen on
   the Loess Plateau to assess the potential benefits of controlled traffic
   oil agricultural production. In this region, long-term traditional
   ploughing with straw removal has resulted in a decline of soil
   productivity and poor soil structure. Several treatments were compared:
   controlled traffic with no-tillage and straw cover (NTSC), controlled
   traffic with shallow tillage and straw cover, and traditional tillage
   (TT) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture. Results show
   clear benefits of controlled traffic farming. Winter wheat growth in
   ploughed Plots Was Much slower than in controlled traffic plots. Mean
   yield from 1998 to 2007 was 11.2\% lower for traditional tillage than
   for controlled traffic plots. The best results were achieved by a
   no-tillage straw cover and controlled traffic system (NTSC), which
   resulted in the greatest benefits to soil Structure after 10 years. The
   NTSC significantly improved soil organic matter content in the top 30
   cut by 27.2\%, total N by 10.8\%, and available P (top 10 cm) by 92.3\%
   compared with TT. Aeration (>60 mu m) and capillary porosity (2-60 mu m)
   were 155.0\%, and 16.1\% greater, respectively, in NTSC plots than in TT
   plots. Consequently, for NTSC, final water infiltration rates were
   67.4\% greater than for TT, whereas water content in the top 130 cm was
   14.9\% higher than in TT, respectively. We conclude therefore that
   controlled traffic combined with no-tillage and straw cover is a
   valuable system for restoring soil productivity and quality of seriously
   degraded soils on the Loess Plateau for the sustainable development of
   agriculture in dryland China.}},

   increased atmospheric CO2. In agriculture, strategies to increase the
   soil carbon (C) sink include no-tillage, cover crops, and improved crop
   rotation. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of
   tillage systems on SOC and total N, soil aggregation and aggregate
   associated C and N in three soil types: Oxisol (Brazil), Vertisol
   (Argentina), and Mollisol (USA). Long-term tillage experiments included
   tilled (T) and no-till (NT) systems. A native grassland was included for
   comparison in each site. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 0-15, and 15-30
   cm depths. Water-stable aggregates (WSA) were separated using a
   wet-sieving method. Total C and total N were determined by dry
   combustion. A shift from native grassland to an agroecosystem decreased
   microbial biomass, but this decrease was less pronounced under NT.
   Cultivation reduced the mass of macroaggregates and the concentration
   associated C and N; however among agroecosystems, NT, regardless soil
   type, tended to be more similar to the native grassland sites.
   Agroecosystems reduced TOC and total N stocks, regardless of soil type,
   compared to the native grassland. This effect followed: Mollisol >
   Oxisol > Vertisol, and was more pronounced at the 0-5 cm soil depth than
   at deeper depths. This loss of C and N was associated with the decrease
   in the mass of macroaggregates and lower C and N concentrations of the
   aggregates. Macroaggregation was related to TOC and microbial biomass in
   the Mollisol, suggesting that the biological process of aggregate
   formation is the principal mechanism of C protection in these soils. The
   relationship between TOC and large macroaggregates showed lower values
   for the Oxisol and Vertisol, indicating that in these soils TOC has a
   complementary role in macroaggregation.}},

   unsustainability of this system has owing to soil structural
   deterioration and nutrient depletion, become evident, resulting from
   continuous puddling on the same piece of land even if recommended
   inorganic fertilizers have been applying regularly. To regenerate and
   maintain soil structure in rice fields, farmers in this region
   frequently use farm yard manure (FYM), but low availability of FYM
   because of its other uses indicates that it could not meet the organic
   matter requirements of this system. We evaluated the long-term effects
   of different locally available jungle grasses and weeds on soil
   hydro-physical properties and rice yield through a 5-year field
   experiment (2000 to 2005) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research
   (ICAR) Complex for North Eastern Hilly (NEH) Region, Umiam, Meghalaya,
   India and also compared their negative or positive effects with FYM in
   acidic, Typic Hapludalf soil. The objective was to determine whether
   locally available grasses (Jungle grass) and weeds (Ambrosia sp.) could
   be used as alternative sources of organic materials for lowland rice in
   scarcity of FYM. Results showed that incorporation of FYM or jungle
   grass or Ambrosia sp., continuously for 5 years in puddled rice soil
   improved soil organic carbon (SOC) by 21.1\%; the stability of
   micro-aggregates, moisture retention capacity, and infiltration rate of
   the soil by 82.5, 10, and 31.3\%, respectively; and soil bulk density
   decreased by 12.6\%. Application of FYM produced better soil physical
   environment than that under jungle grass and Ambrosia sp. However, as
   these grasses and weeds contained higher nutrient levels than FYM and
   increased the SOC slowly, these organics may serve as alternative to FYM
   and may have a dramatic effect on long-term productivity of rice. The
   gradual improvement in soil physical properties led to a significantly
   higher yield of rice. We conclude that applying organic manure or
   organic residue annually may mitigate the negative effect of puddling
   and related properties and therefore could contribute to the
   sustainability of the wetland rice ecosystem.}},

   Results indicate that the conservation practice of vertical mulching
   reduces the degree of chemical enrichment ofthe sediments and mainly
   prevents the transport of these sediments away from plantations,

   reduction in runoff volume. Crop yields did not benefit from low compost

  abstract = {{We studied the influence of different soil tillage and fertilization on
   chemical parameters, soil structure stability and carbon distribution in
   water-stable macro-aggregates (WSA(ma)) of loamy Orthic Luvisol. In
   1994, the Department of Plant Production of the Slovak Agricultural
   University in Nitra established a long-term field experiment in locality
   Dolna Malanta. In 1994-2007, the soil samples were collected from the
   depth 0-0.3 m. The field experiment included two types of soil tillage
   (conventional tillage-CT and reduced tillage-RT) and three variants of
   fertilization (1. C-o-without fertilization, 2. PR + NPK-crop residues
   together with added NPK fertilizers, 3. NPK-with added NPK fertilizers).
   Different tillage and fertilization had statistically significant
   influence on changes of the soil pH and soil sorptive complex. The
   values of pH were more favourable in RT than in CT. In NPK (by 26\%) and
   in PR + NPK (by 21\%) decreased values of hydrolytic acidity. On the
   other hand it increased the sum of basic cations. This led to the
   increase of cation exchangeable capacity. In comparison to CT, a higher
   total carbon concentration (Q) was determined in RT. According to
   vulnerability coefficient (K-v), the soil structure stability was better
   in RT (4.64 +/- 1.54) than in CT (5.15 +/- 1.75). Average value of
   WSA(ma) was higher by 9\% in RT and it led to increasing of the sum of
   mean weight diameters of water-stable aggregates (MWD-WSA) by 11\% and
   increasing of index stability (S-w) by 12\%. We determined linear
   dependences between C-t and critic level of soil organic matter
   concentration (S-t) in CT and RT as well as in PR + NPK and NPK. The
   negative correlation between Ca2+ and S-t (-0.507(..)) and positive
   correlation between Ca2+ and crusting index (0.525(..)) were detected in
   CT. The values of Ca2+ were in positive correlation with crusting index
   (0.363(.)) in RT. We observed higher concentrations of C-t and labile
   carbon content (C-L) in water-stable micro-aggregates (WSA(mi)) and
   WSA(ma) in the size fractions from 25 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-3) m in RT.
   There were also higher concentrations of C-t and C-L in WSA(ma) in the
   size fractions >3 X 10(-3) m in CT. The application of crop residues
   together with NPK fertilizers increased the concentration of C-t in all
   fractions of WSA(ma). On the other hand, C-t concentration decreased by
   7\% in WSA(mi). In PR + NPK, the highest concentration of C-L was
   observed in WSA(ma) in the size fraction 2 x 10(-3) to 3 x 10(-3) m. (C)

   conducted a multiple-year investigation of how cover crop management
   (grazed and ungrazed) and tillage system {[}conventional (CT; initial
   moldboard plowing and thereafter disk tillage) and no tillage (NIT)]
   affected soil physical properties (bulk density, aggregation,
   infiltration, and penetration resistance) on a Typic Kanhapludult in
   Georgia. Responses were determined in two cropping systems: summer
   grain/winter cover crop and winter grain/ summer cover crop. Soil bulk
   density was reduced (P = 0.02) with CT compared with NT to a depth of 30
   cm at the end of 0.5 year, but only to a depth of 12 cm at the end of 2,
   2.5. and 4.5 years. Grazing of cover crops had little effect on soil
   bulk density, except eventually with 4.5 years of management.
   Water-stable macroaggregation was reduced (P <= 0.01) with CT compared
   with NT to a depth of 12 cm at all sampling times during the first 2.5
   years of evaluation. Stability of macroaggregates in water was
   unaffected by grazing of cover crops in both tillage systems. Across 7
   sampling events during the first 4 years, there was a tendency (P =
   0.07) for water infiltration rate to be lower with grazing of cover
   crops (5.6 mm rnin(-1)) than when ungrazed (6.9 mm min(-1)),
   irrespective of tillage system. Across 10 sampling events, soil
   penetration resistance was greater under NT than under CT at a depth of
   0-10 cm (P = 0.001) and the difference was greater in ungrazed than in
   grazed systems (P = 0.06). Biannual CT operations may have alleviated
   any surface degradation with animal traffic, but the initially high
   level of soil organic matter following long-term pasture and conversion
   to cropland with NIT may have buffered the soil from any detrimental

   structure, but very little is known about the effect of changes in
   aggregate size distribution on soil physical, chemical and biological
   properties. We decided to use dry sieved aggregates since this technique
   is commonly used in semiarid regions. The study was carried out at
   Anguil, La Pampa, Argentina. The soil was a sandy loam Entic Haplustoll
   with a carbonate-free A-horizon. The PAS site had been under weeping
   love grass for more than 40 years. Parts of this PAS were turned to
   cultivation in 1989 (CULT14) and in 2001 (CULT2). Sampling was carried
   out at 0.6 m intervals to 0.18 m depth. Bulk density (BD), organic
   carbon (OC), and water holding capacity and infiltration were determined
   on these samples. Dry aggregate size distribution and OC content of the
   size fractions were determined on large undisturbed samples. Samples of
   pooled aggregate size fractions > 4, 1-4, and < 1 mm, as well as
   corresponding samples of non fractionated soil were incubated and
   respiration was measured by CO2 evolved. The soil of CULT2 had 29\%
   lower contents of large (> 4 mm) and 37\% higher contents of very small
   (< 1 mm) aggregates than PAS. The intermediate size aggregates were not
   affected by the short-term effect of tillage. OC loss in CULT2 was 16\%
   regarding PAS. Longer term effects of cultivation were characterized by
   30\% loss of intermediate size aggregates, 22\% increase of bulk
   density, 74 and 19\% decrease in water infiltration and water retention,
   respectively of CULT14 compared to PAS. A 32\% decrease of OC was
   observed after 14 years of cultivation. Intermediate size aggregates had
   highest OC contents and no difference between treatments was found,
   except for a lower value of large aggregates in CULT14. Respiration
   rates and total CO2 evolved was related to OC contents of fractions;
   however, PAS respired more from its small aggregates than expected from
   their OC content. The results showed that OC turnover and loss of
   aggregation was very fast in this soil, but soil hydraulic properties
   were affected in the longer term. Dry aggregates were found to useful
   for studying soil degradation, and they showed similar trends as those
   indicated in the literature for water stable aggregates. (c) 2008

   impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six
   cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to
   organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared
   since 1989 on a loam soil. A decline in soil structure quality was found
   in a conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational
   grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than
   other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate
   stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys
   in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The
   latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable
   system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an
   arable system without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring,
   organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found.
   This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small
   aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall
   increases in earthworm density (84\%), earthworm biomass (80\%) and the
   density of earthworm channels (132\%) in the topsoil between 1994 and
   2004. Most of these increases were found in systems with 1-3 years of
   ley in the 4-year rotation. Low values of all earthworm parameters, and
   only minor changes over the period studied, were found in two
   non-organic arable systems without ley, indicating high pressure on soil
   fauna. Lower earthworm activity was found in the non-organic arable
   system with reduced tillage as compared to the non-organic arable system
   with annual ploughing. Thus, 50\% leys in the rotation appeared
   desirable for the maintenance of satisfactory soil structure and
   earthworm activity. Though the deterioration of soil structure in the
   conventional arable system was not extreme, as the soil was well
   structured initially, the results may have implications for the
   sustainability of stockless arable systems on soils with a less
   favourable initial structure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   means of improving nitrogen management in irrigated maize cropping
   systems. The objective was to develop precise nutrient management
   strategies for semi-arid irrigated cropping systems. This study was
   conducted in five fields in northeastern Colorado, USA. Two techniques
   for delineating management zones were developed and compared: SSMZ and
   yield-based management zones (YBMZ). Nitrogen uptake and grain yield
   differences among SSMZs were compared as were soil properties. Both
   management zone techniques were used to divide fields into smaller units
   that were different with regard to productivity potential (e.g., high
   zones had high productivity potential while low zones had low
   productivity potential). Economic analysis was also performed. Based on
   grain yield productivity, the SSMZs performed better than the YBMZ
   technique in most cases. Grain yield and N uptake between the low and
   high productivity management zones were statistically different for most
   site-years and N fertilizer rates (p < 0.05). Soil properties helped to
   explain the productivity potential of the management zones. The low SSMZ
   was markedly different from the high SSMZ based on bulk density, organic
   carbon, sand, silt, porosity and soil moisture. Net returns ranged from
   188 to 679 USD ha(-1). In two out of three site-years the variable yield
   goal strategy resulted in the largest net returns. In this study, the
   SSMZ approach delineates areas of different productivity accurately
   across the agricultural fields. The SSMZs are different with regard to
   soil properties as well as grain yield and N uptake. Site-specific
   management zones are an inexpensive and pragmatic approach to precise N

   types (i.e. sand, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field

   phosphorus (P-av), exchangeable cations (K-ex, Na-ex, Mg-ex, and Ca-ex)
   and salinity, evaluated by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). A
   bi-factorial quality index based on fuzzy logic was then tested and
   applied to assess the overall soil quality and its evolution in the
   cropping systems. A minimum dataset of chemical (pH, organic carbon,
   cation exchange capacity, P-av and K-ex) and physical parameters
   (available water content and water-filled porosity) was used to
   elaborate the index. In general, the use of organic fertilizer resulted
   in higher P-av, K-ex and Mg-ex concentrations than the mineral
   treatments at the same levels, whereas no differences for Na-ex and
   Ca-ex were observed. Salinity level was not influenced by the organic
   treatments probably because the consistent water drainage in the area
   prevented salt accumulation. The soil quality index represented the soil
   productivity function, explaining up to 74\% of yield variability. Index
   comparison highlighted the positive role of organic and mixed
   fertilizations in increasing and maintaining the soil quality. The

   tool for the policy maker to evaluate the effects of management

   techniques for managing crop residues under zero tillage in wheat-oat
   rotation: 1) burned residues (T); 2) residues in rows (RH); 3) standing
   residues (RP); and 4) chopped residues (RPC). The evaluated variables
   were soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregates stability measured by mean
   weight diameter (MWD), distribution of water stable aggregates,
   saturated water conductivity (K-s), bulk density (D-a), and resistance
   to penetration (Rp). The experimental design was complete random blocks
   and means were compared with the Tukey test (p <= 0.05). The results
   showed a low MWD (0.20 to 0.28 mm) and a dominance of water stable
   fractions smaller than 0.25 mm that was above 66\% in all of the
   treatments. This suggests that the structural system is susceptible to
   physical degradation; RP and RPC had better structural stability and a
   higher proportion (p <= 0.05) of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm), as well as
   a significant increase in SOC (p <= 0.05). The treatment RPC had
   significantly lower values of K, (0.76 cm h(-1)), D-a and Rp, which is
   favorable for sustainability of the soil structural system.}},

  abstract = {{Forest and grassland soils in north-eastern Iran are being degraded and
   destroyed by inappropriate agricultural activities. This study
   investigated effects of land-use changes on several indicators of soil
   quality (SQ) in this area. We found higher organic carbon (OC) and total
   nitrogen (N) contents in virgin soils (under forests and pastures) than
   in cultivated soils. Distribution of OC throughout the soil profile was
   influenced by the type and length of tillage operations performed at
   different sites. Cultivation reduced OC content of the subsoil
   (0.50-1.00 m) and contributed to a more uniform distribution of organic
   matter in the plough layer (0-0.50 m) by mixing upper and lower horizon
   soils and incorporating of organic inputs to a greater depth. In 4 of 5
   sites, tilled soils had lower ECe and SAR values than the virgin soils,
   but when the water table was near the soil surface, the ECe and SAR
   values were higher in cultivated sites. This suggests that when the
   water table is deep, the quality of salt-affected virgin soils may be
   improved by cultivation and leaching of excess salts to deeper layers.
   In 4 of 5 sites, the virgin soils had slightly greater clay content than
   the tilled soils, but these soils also had 41-89\% less dispersible clay
   than their cultivated counterparts. The virgin soils had 2-31-fold
   greater aggregate stability, 4-33\% lower bulk density, 6-31\% higher
   water-holding capacity (at 0.3 bar suction), higher cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), and higher respiration rate than the cultivated soils.
   The results of this study indicate that frequent tillage and use of
   summer fallow deteriorates SQ by decreasing SOC and enhancing soil
   erosion through decreased structural stability and increased
   mechanically dispersible clay. The results stress the need for farming
   practices that preserve OC in soils in order to reduce flooding and
   erosion risks.}},

   tepetate (hardened layers from tuff) cover large proportions of the land
   surface, and are therefore of economic and social importance. Under
   natural conditions, tepetates are unproductive due to their hardness and
   low porosity, but they can be used agriculturally after the hardened
   layer is broken up and fertilizer and organic matter are added Just
   broken up tepetate consists of angular clods of the original
   consolidated material of various sizes and they are devoided of
   aggregate. Because of the scarce presence of organic matter these
   fragmented tepetates present low availability of N and P, limited water
   infiltration, and small water holding capacity Additions of manure and
   cultivation of Leguminosae aim to improve the physical properties of
   tepetates and particularly to promote the formation of aggregates. Such
   ameliorated tepetates alleviate the demand for agricultural land. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the formation of aggregates from
   initially broken zip and fragmented tepetates, their dry and wet
   stability, and the distribution of organic carbon in aggregates and
   fragments of different sizes in tepetates cultivated between 1 and 100
   years. The tepetates were were arbitrarily classified as (I) recently
   broken up; (II) affected by severe erosion: (III) cultivated mostly
   under monoculture: (IV) cultivated with Leguminosae for at least 20
   years and receiving approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of farm yard manure (FYM)
   per year; (V) cultivated under no-tillage and few external inputs; (VI)
   cultivated with cereals and Leguminosae and receiving more than
   Mg.ha(-1) per year of FYM; (VII) Used as greenhouse bed; (VIII)
   cultivated with no-tillage and approximately 5 to 10 Mg.ha(-1) of FYM;
   (IX) used as greenhouse bed and addition of approximately 2 Mg.ha(-1) of
   composted wood residues per year In addition to the above mentioned
   tepetates, two agricultural soils: one managed with traditional tillage
   (A) and a second with no tillage (IX) were included as checks. We
   collected 97 samples of tepetates and four soils in the Basin of the Rio
   Texcoco and neighboring communities. The aggregate stability test
   overestimated stable aggregates due to the presence of remaining hard
   fragments of tepetates of different size; the hardness of the latter was
   one to three times greater than that of the aggregates. The relative
   amount of stable aggregates increased with the time of cultivation,
   approaching 80\% after 100 years. The recently broken zip tepetates
   contained only little of C, whereas stable aggregates showed one to
   three times larger concentration. The accumulation of C with time in
   tepetate fragments was small, in contrast to the aggregates formed in
   the same period. The accumulation of organic C was larger in smaller
   aggregate particles and followed logarithmic or potential models. The
   results of this study show that ameliorated tepetates have the potential
   to store carbon. However the accumulated amount of C depend on the
   aggregate formation, which in turn is related with the agricultural
   management. Classes VII, VIII y IX produced more stable aggregates and
   thus aecumulated more carbon.}},

   productivity, is generally thought to be supplemented through the
   application of nutrients mainly through inorganic fertilizers. The
   physical fertility of the soil, which creates suitable environment for
   the availability and uptake of these nutrients, is generally ignored.
   The present study aims to characterize the soil physical environment in
   relation to the long term application of farm yard manure (FYM) and
   inorganic fertilizers in rice-wheat. The treatments during both rice and
   wheat crops were (i) farm yard manure @ 20 t ha(-1) (FYM); (ii) nitrogen
   @ 120 kg ha(-1) (N-120); (iii) nitrogen and phosphorus @ 120 and 30 kg
   ha(-1)(N120P30) ) and (iv) nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium @ 120, 30
   and 30 (N120P30K30) in addition to (iv) control treatment, i.e. without
   any fertilizer and/or FYM addition. The treatments were replicated four
   times in randomized block design in a sandy loam (typic Ustipsament,
   non-saline, slightly alkaline). Bulk density, structural stability of
   soil aggregates and water holding capacity of 0-60 cm soil layer were
   measured.
   The average mean weight diameter (MWD) was highest in FYM-plots both in
   rice (0.237 mm) and wheat (0.249 mm) closely followed by that in
   N120P30K30 plots. The effect of FYM in increasing the MWD decreased with
   soil depth. The addition of both FYM and N120P30K30 increased the
   organic carbon by 44 and 37\%, respectively in rice. The total porosity
   of soil increased with the application of both FYM and N120P30K30 from
   that in control plots. In 0-15 cm soil layer, the total porosity
   increased by 25\% with FYM from that in control plots. This difference
   decreased to 13\% in 15-30 cm soil layer. The average water holding
   capacity (WHC) was 16 and 11\% higher with FYM and N120P30K30
   application from that in control plots. The MWD, total porosity and WHC
   improved with the application of balanced application of fertilizers.
   The grain yield and uptake of N, P and K by both rice and wheat were
   higher with the application of FYM and inorganic fertilizers than in
   control plots. The carbon sequestration rate after 32 years was maximum
   (0.31 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in FYM-plots, followed by 0.26 t ha(-1)

   relative water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity appeared to
   be useful SPQ indicators because they were sensitive to land management,
   and proposed optimum or critical values are available in the literature.
   Soil macroporosity was also sensitive to land management, but optimum or
   critical values for this parameter are not yet established. Soil matrix
   porosity and plant-available water capacity did not respond
   substantially or consistently to changes in land management, and were
   thus not useful as SPQ indicators in this study. Converting long-term BG
   to MP caused overall SPQ to decline to levels similar to lone-term MP
   within 3-4 years. Converting long-term NT to MP or vice versa caused
   only minor changes in overall SPQ. With respect to the measured SPQ
   indicators and their optimum or critical values, both VS and BG produced
   ``good{''} overall SPQ in the near-surface soil. while long-term

   physical, chemical and physico-chemical properties of a sandy soil were
   examined after amending the soil with two different composts produced
   from municipal solid wastes. Triticale (X Triticosecale), cultivated in
   a 3-y monoculture, was used as a test plant. Both composts differed in
   their concentrations of heavy metals. Composts were applied
   non-recurrently in the spring before sowing, at the rates of 18, 36, and
   72 t dry matter ha(-1). The plots without fertilization, and those
   fertilized annually with mineral nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and
   potassium (K) were used as controls. Soil samples were collected I month
   after compost application, as well as each year after harvesting.
   Application of both composts improved soil physical properties,
   associated with increasing content of organic carbon (OC). Statistically
   significant increases of total porosity, field water capacity and
   amounts of plant-available water were found only in the short time after
   compost application. Despite the fact that soil OC content decreased
   with time, a C:N ratio clearly increased in the third year after compost
   application, which was explained by a depletion of N reserve. Both
   composts caused a large increase of plant-available P, K, and magnesium
   (Mg), which was observed during the entire period of the experiment.
   Beneficial changes were also observed in soil humic substances
   composition. These were confirmed by increased humic acids content and
   humic/fulvic acid ratios. Soil cation exchange capacity and base
   saturation increased in all plots amended with composts. This effect was
   still observed I year after compost application, while in the third year
   it remained significant only at the highest compost rates. Compost

   Although crop productivity is sustained mainly through the application
   of organic manure in the Indian Himalayas, little information is
   available on C sequestration, C content in different aggregate size
   fractions and soil water transmission properties (infiltration and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity) as affected by long-term manure
   addition. We analyzed results of an 8-year experiment, initiated in
   1995-1996 on a silty clay loam soil, to determine the influence of
   fertilizer and fertilizer + farmyard manure (FYM) application on those
   important soil properties. The overall increase in soil organic C (SOC)
   content in the 0-45 cm soil depth in NPK + FYM treatment as compared to
   NPK and control treatments was 11.0 and 13.9 Mg C ha(-1) at the end of 8
   years, respectively. Application of FYM significantly reduced soil bulk
   density and increased mean weight diameter (MWD) and SOC contents in
   different aggregate size fractions. Soil organic C content in
   macroaggregates was greater than in microaggregates. The response of SOC
   content to FYM application was dependent upon inorganic fertilization
   and more upon balanced application of NPK than N only. Steady state
   infiltration rate under NPK + FYM (1.98 cm h(-1)) was higher than under
   unfertilized (0.72 cm h(-1)) and NPK (1.2 cm h(-1)). Soil water
   sorptivity (calculated from Philip's equation) under NPK + FYM (1.06 cm
   min(-0-5)) was higher than under NPK (0.61 cm min(-0.5)). We conclude

   between the wheel tracks. The following indicators were assessed in
   undisturbed soil samples from the mid 0-15 cm layer: water content at

   estimate soil aeration and water storage capacity indicators. Disturbed
   soil samples were collected in the 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm depths to measure
   the organic carbon content and calculate the soil organic carbon

  abstract = {{Naturally occurring wetting-and-drying cycles often enhance aggregation
   and give rise to a stable soil structure. In comparatively dry regions,
   such as large areas of Australia, organic-matter (OM) contents in
   topsoils of arable land are usually small. Therefore, the effects of
   wetting and drying are almost solely reliant on the clay content. To
   investigate the relations between wetting-and-drying cycles,
   aggregation, clay content, and OM in the Australian environment, an
   experiment was set up to determine the relative influence of both clay
   content (23\%, 31\%, 34\%, and 38\%) and OM amendments of barley straw
   (equivalent to 3.1 t ha(-1), 6.2 t ha(-1), and 12.4 t ha(-1)) on the
   development of water-stable aggregates in agricultural soil. The
   aggregate stability of each of the sixteen composite soils was
   determined after one, three, and six wet/dry cycles and subsequent fast
   and slow prewetting and was then compared to the aggregate stabilities
   of all other composite soils.
   While a single wet/dry cycle initiated soil structural evolution in all
   composite soils, enhancing macroaggregation, the incorporation of barley
   straw was most effective for the development of water-stable aggregates
   in those soils with 34\% and 38\% clay. Repeated wetting-and-drying
   events revealed that soil aggregation is primarily based on the clay
   content of the soil, but that large straw additions also tend to enhance
   soil aggregation. Relative to untreated soil, straw additions equivalent
   to 3.1 t ha(-1) and 12.4 t ha(-1) increased soil aggregation by about
   100\% and 250\%, respectively, after three wet/dry cycles and fast
   prewetting, but were of less influence with subsequent wet/dry cycles.
   Straw additions were even more effective in aggregating soil when
   combined with slow prewetting; after three wet/dry cycles, the mean
   weight diameters of aggregates were increased by 70\% and 140\% with the
   same OM additions and by 160\% and 290\% after six wet/dry cycles,
   compared to samples without organic amendments.
   We suggest that in arable soils poor in OM and with a field texture
   grade of clay loam or finer, the addition of straw, which is often
   available from preceding crops, may be useful for improving aggregation.
   For a satisfactory degree of aggregate stability and an improved soil
   structural form, we found that straw additions of at least 6.2 t ha(-1)
   were required. However, rapid wetting of straw-amended soil will disrupt
   newly formed aggregates, and straw has only a limited ability to sustain
   structural improvement.}},

   soil biological activity and aggregate stability in an Oxisol typical to
   the region. Three different tillage practices common to the Cerrado
   region (no-till, disk harrow, and disk plow) and an area under native
   vegetation were examined. Five different soil enzyme activities, C- and

   determined. Total N, acid phosphatase, arylamidase, and C- and
   N-mineralization were the most sensitive to changes in tillage
   management. For each of these analyses, the no-till system had greater
   concentrations or activities (18-186\%) than disk plow in the 0-5 cm
   layer. Significant differences observed in the 0-5 cm depth did not
   necessarily translate into total profile differences to a depth of 30
   cm. No-till had significantly greater levels of total N, and C- and
   N-mineralization (20-127\%) than the disk harrow system. Total N ranged
   from 1.8 to 2.2 ka m(-3); C- and N-mineralization (24-day incubation)
   ranged from 2.8 to 6.8 and 0.04 to 0.10 kg m(-3), respectively, among
   tillage systems and soil depths. Enzyme activities in all treatments
   were more strongly correlated with total soil N than with soil organic C

   was related to SOC (r = 0.73) and total N (r = 0.92), indicating that
   soil organic matter does play a significant role in stabilizing
   aggregates in Oxisols. Results indicated the importance of reducing
   tillage as a means of increasing soil biological activity of the topsoil

   effects of tillage, crops and fertilizer sources on size distribution of
   water-stable aggregates (WSA) and nutrient concentrations in aggregate
   fractions. Soil samples were collected from field sites involving
   sixteen factorial combinations of tillage {[}conventional tillage (CT)
   or no-till (NT)], crop rotations {[}continuous maize (CC) or
   soybean/maize (SC)] and fertilizer sources (0, 15, 30 and 45 Mg wet
   weight ha(-1) of composted cattle manure balanced with inorganic
   fertilizers). Aggregate fractionation was performed using a wet-sieving
   method. Four years after the treatments were established, the proportion
   of large WSA (WSA(> 2mm)) was greater in the NT system, suggesting that
   NT increased soil aggregation compared to the CT system. There was no
   difference in soil aggregation between continuous maize and
   soybean/maize rotations. The application of 30 and 45 Mg ha(-1) year 1
   of composted manure produced more WSA(> 2mm) than inorganic fertilizers.
   The WSA(> 2mm) had a higher total C concentration in CT than NT soils,
   indicating that WSA(> 2mm) formed in CT systems contained more soil
   organic matter (SOM) than those in NT systems. However, the difference
   disappeared when the data were expressed on a sand-free aggregate basis,
   indicating a dilution effect due to more sand in WSA(> 2mm) from the NT
   system than the CT system. Total C, N and P concentrations were at least
   3 times higher in water-stable microaggregates (WSA(0.25-0.053mm)) than
   water-stable macroaggregates (WSA(> 0.25mm)). The WSA(0.25-0.053mm)
   fraction is considered to be a sink for these nutrients, but may also be
   susceptible to erosion. Transport processes that preferentially remove
   the WSA(0.25-0.053mm) fraction from agroecosystems could lead to
   nutrient loading in adjacent ecosystems. It was concluded that adopting

   phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate
   distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment
   started in 1982 in an and region of northwest China. Application of
   inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase
   SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and
   SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18\% on average,
   compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment.
   Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially,
   resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium
   nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application
   of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and
   nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop
   residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or
   combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK
   treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations
   from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg(-1), respectively, to 15.46

   macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD
   increased with increasing SOC concentration (R-2=0.75). The SOC
   concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in
   macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm).
   Approximately 54-60\% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates

   without FYM but 57-64\% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates (>

   mu m (equivalent pore diameter), in accordance with lower Job. Available
   water capacity was greater with NT than with RT and MT. Higher SWC under
   conservation tillage systems (NT, NTSB and RT) than under MT was
   attributed mainly to greater AWC and to the mulching effect of crop
   residues. Crop yield in the driest year of the 5-year period was lowest
   under MT whereas no differences among treatments were found over the
   5-year period. Stubble burning did not affect AWC nor barley yield.
   Tillage had a greater impact on soil properties and on crop yield than
   crop residue management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Colorado (CO); Brookings, South Dakota (SD); Bushland, Texas (TX);
   Fargo, North Dakota (ND); Mandan (ND); Mead, Nebraska (NE); Sidney,
   Montana (MT); and Swift Current, Saskatchewan (SK), Canada. Objectives
   were to quantify the changes in soil physical attributes in cropping
   systems and assess the potential of individual soil attributes as
   sensitive indicators of change in SQ. Soil samples were collected three
   times per year from each treatment at each site for one rotation cycle
   (4 years at Brookings and Mead). Water infiltration rates were measured.
   Soil bulk density (BD) and gravimetric water were measured at 0-7.5,
   7.5-15, and 15-30 cm depth increments and water-filled pore space ratio
   (WFPS) was calculated. At six locations, a rotary sieve was used to
   separate soil (top 5 cm) into six aggregate size groups and calculate
   mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregates. Under the CON system at
   Brookings, dry aggregates (> 19 mm) abraded into the smallest size class
   (< 0.4 mm) on sieving. In contrast, the large aggregates from the ALT
   system abraded into size classes between 2 and 6mm. Dry aggregate size
   distribution (DASD) shows promise as an indicator of SQ related to
   susceptibility of soil to wind erosion. Aggregates from CON were least
   stable in water. Soil C was greater under ALT than CON for both
   Brookings and Mead. At other locations, MWD of aggregates under
   continuous crop or no tillage (ALT systems) was greater than MWD under
   CON. There was no crop system effect on water infiltration rates for
   locations having the same tillage within cropping system. Tillage
   resulted in increased, decreased, or unchanged near-surface BD. Because
   there was significant temporal variation in water infiltration, MWD, and
   BD, conclusions based on a single point-in-time observation should be
   avoided. Elevated WFPS at Fargo, Brookings, and Mead may have resulted
   in anaerobic soil conditions during a portion of the year. Repeated
   measurements of WFPS or DASD revealed important temporal characteristics
   of SQ that could be used to judge soil condition as affected by

   biomass and microbial community composition in the direction of native
   prairies, but with the restoration methods tested it may take many

   fractions in the maize soil on the basis of the delta(13)C values. Total
   SOC stocks down to a depth of 60 cm and including the humus layer were
   larger at the spruce site (10.3 kg C m(-2)) as compared with the
   grassland, wheat and maize (7 to 8 C kg m(-2)). However, SOC stocks in
   the mineral soil were smaller in the forest soil than in the
   agricultural soils. In the arable soils, the aggregate fractions 53-250
   pm and 250-1000 pm were the most abundant size fractions, whereas
   aggregates > 1000 mu m were most abundant in the grassland and forest
   soil. The SOC concentration and the C/N ratio were greater for
   macroaggregates (> 250 pm) than microaggregates (< 250 mu m) in the

   maize-derived C was smallest in the fraction < 53 mu m with 24\% and
   steadily increased with increasing aggregate size to 47\% in the
   fraction > 1000 pm.
   The major part (86-91\%) of the SOC was associated with the heavy
   mineral fraction at the grassland, maize and wheat site. In the A

   for 52\% of the total SOC content. The C/N ratios of density fractions
   decreased in the order free POM< 1.6> occluded POM > Mineral-SOM for all

   The mean age of organic carbon in the water-stable aggregates in the Ap
   horizon of the maize site increased with decreasing aggregate size from

   are being seriously degraded and destructed due to extensive
   agricultural activities. This study investigated the effects of changes
   in land-use type on some soil properties in a Mediterranean plateau.
   Three adjacent land-use types included the cultivated lands, which have
   been converted from pastures for 12 years, fragmented forests, and
   unaltered pastures lands. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were
   collected from four sites at each of the three different land-use types
   from depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm in Typic Haploxeroll soils with an
   elevation of about 1400 m. When the pasture was converted into
   cultivation, soil organic matter (SOM) pool of cultivated lands for a
   depth of 0-20 cm were significantly reduced by, on average 49\% relative
   to SOM content of the pasture lands. There was no significant difference
   in SOM between the depths in each land-use type, and SOM values of the
   forest and pasture lands were almost similar. There was also a
   significant change in soil bulk density (BD) among cultivation (1.33 Mg
   m(-3)), pasture (1.19 Mg m(-3)), and forest (1.25 Mg m(-3)) soils at
   depth of 0-20 cm. Only for the pasture, BD of the depth of 0-10 cm was
   significantly different from that of 10-20 cm. Depending upon the
   increases in BD and disruption of pores by cultivation, total porosity
   decreased accordingly. Cultivation of the unaltered pasture obviously
   increased the soil erodibility measured by USLE-K factor for each soil
   depth, and USLE-K factor was approximately two times greater in the
   cultivated land than in the pasture indicating the vulnerability of the
   cultivated land to water erosion. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and
   water-stable aggregation (WSA) were greater in the pasture and forest
   soils compared to the cultivated soils, and didn't change with the depth
   for each land-use type. Aggregates of >4.0 mm size were dominant in the
   pasture and forest soils, whereas the cultivated soils comprised
   aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. I found that samples collected from
   cultivated land gave the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity values
   regardless of soil depths, whereas the highest values were measured on
   samples from forest soils. In conclusion, the results showed that the
   cultivation of the pastures degraded the soil physical properties,
   leaving soils more susceptible to the erosion. This suggests that land
   disturbances should be strictly avoided in the pastures with the limited
   soil depth in the southern Mediterranean highlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier

   (CTP); conventional tillage with potato, followed by oat in rotation
   with corn (CTPOC); conventional tillage with corn (CTC); no-till with
   corn (NTC); eucalyptus forest (EF); and native vegetation (NV). The bulk

   organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate and other soil properties and to
   estimate historic depletion of SOC under different soil management

   long-term experiments in Ohio studied were those sited at South

   degrees 48' N) experiment was established in 1962 on Crosby silt loam
   (fine mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf). The site has long-term annual
   temperature and precipitation of 10.8 degrees C and 1043 mm,
   respectively. Tillage treatments for continuous corn (Zea mays) were NT,
   chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow (MP). The Hoytville (84 degrees 04'
   W and 41 degrees 03' N) experiment was established in 1987 on Hoytville
   clay loam (fine, illitic mesic Mollic Epiaqualfs) soil. The site has
   long-term annual temperature and precipitation of 9.9 degrees C and 845
   rum, respectively. There were two crop rotations: (i) 2-year
   corn-soybean (Glycine max) rotation with NT and subsoiling and (ii)
   3-year com-soybean-oat (Avena sativa) rotation with NT, CP, and
   rotational tillage soil management. The Hoytville clay site is poorly
   drained, has higher clay content, and higher and more even by
   distributed antecedent level of SOC in the soil profile than does the
   South Charleston silt loam soil. No-till increased SOC and N pools in
   the 0 to 5-cm layer in silt loam soil but had no effect in clay soil.
   The rate of SOC sequestration in the silt-loam soil under NT was 175 kg
   C ha(-1) y(-1). The silt loam soil had higher SOC and N stratification
   ratios in NT than in MP and CP treatments, whereas the stratification
   ratios were low and similar in all treatments in the clayey soil. For
   both soils, there were no differences between tillage treatments in
   several soil properties including texture, available water capacity,
   hydraulic conductivity (K), and cation exchange capacity. The NT
   decreased soil bulk density and pH in the 0 to 15-cm layer in the silt
   loam soil. The plow till treatments had a small impact on soil
   aggregation in clayey soil. The decline in water-stable aggregates with
   reference to NT was no more than one sixth. In the silt loam soil,
   however, the water-stable aggregates in plow till treatments were merely
   one third of that in the NT treatment. The historic loss of the SOC pool
   for 0 to 30-cm depth under agricultural land use was 25 to 35\% in silt
   loam and 19 to 25\% in the clayey soil.}},

   diameter (MWD) of the aggregates was on average 0.5 mm greater under NT

   diverse rotations, which included a leguminous green-manure crop, in
   comparison with continuous wheat (Triticam aestivum)-soybean (Glycine

   macroaggregates (> 250 mu m). At both sites, CT decreased the proportion

   significantly higher in the macroaggregates of the NT than of the CT
   systems. The lack of differences in C, N content, and ON ratio across
   aggregate-size classes indicated that these soils dominated by 1:1 clays
   and Fe/Al oxides do not express an aggregate hierarchy and that an
   increase in aggregation does not explain the increase in C and N under
   NT. In conclusion, CT decreased aggregation similarly in Oxisols as in
   temperate soils, but this decrease does not explain the loss of C and N
   because the tight feedback between soil organic matter (SOM) and
   aggregate stability (i.e., SOM being a major binding agent) observed for
   temperate soils was not found for Oxisols.}},

   stabilize soil aggregates in a calcareous sandy loam from a vineyard in
   Champagne after 9 years under different management systems. Four
   different treatments were studied: (i) a bluegrass (Poa pratensis)
   surface cover between the vine rows (GC) with bare soil under the vines
   (R); two organic mulches of (ii) coniferous (CB) or (iii) poplar (PB)
   bark that covered the entire soil surface, and (iv) bare soil between
   the rows as a control. The bark amendments were applied every 3 years at
   rates of 61 and 67 t ha(-1) for the PB and CB treatments, respectively.
   The kinetics of soil disaggregation in water fitted a power law (A=K
   t(-D)), in which K was the fraction of water-stable >200 mum aggregates
   remaining after 1 hour of wet-sieving. In the 0-5 cm layer, aggregate

   bluegrass cover enhanced structural stability in the 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm

   rhizodeposition enhancing microbially produced metabolites, such as
   carbohydrates. Establishing grass cover or applying bark mulch are
   effective agricultural practices that improve soil aggregate stability
   and thus should reduce soil erosion. The vegetative growth of the vines

   covered soils compared with the control soil; however, no difference in

   agronomic productivity for five land use and soil management treatments

   steady state infiltration rate (i(c)), saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K-s), soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, water stable aggregation
   (WSA), mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), and texture. The
   correlation analysis on the measured soil attributes reduced the number
   of key variables from 17 to 11. A rating index on a 1 to 5 scale was
   obtained for each of the key soil properties. The linear regression
   analysis was first performed with key soil attributes as independent
   variables and biomass or grain yields as dependent variables, with the
   rating factor later assigned to each measured key soil attribute. The
   multiple regression analysis showed that SOC and WSA explained more than
   35\% of variability in biomass and 33\% in grain yields, respectively,
   and were identified as the major SQIs. Other important SQIs were rho(b),
   AWC, MWD, pH, and EC. The cumulative sustainability ratings (CR) for
   each land use showed that NTM was the most sustainable soil management
   treatment (CR = 20) and CT the least sustainable (CR = 30). The CR was
   also correlated significantly with grain yield (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.002).

   distribution were studied in soil on afforested agricultural land in
   western Finland. Sites with an OM < 40\% in the 0-20 cm soil layer were

   suggested that the properties of former agricultural soils differ
   considerably from the pristine mineral forest soils. The sites studied
   were characterised by high OM, fine texture, gleyic properties in the
   soil profile and low air-filled porosity (AFP) at field capacity (-10
   kPa matric potential), resulting from the predomination of small pores.
   AFP was, in general, less than 20\% in the topmost soil layer and
   decreased markedly with increasing soil depth indicating deteriorating
   aeration. In mineral soils (OM < 15\% in the 0-20 cm soil depth) with a
   median particle size of <0.02 mm (clayey and silty soils) AFP was
   significantly lower than in the coarser-textured soils. In mull soils
   (OM 15-40\% in the 0-20 cm soil depth), texture did not affect AFP.
   Prediction of AFP from OM was not successful because OM controlled both
   the upper and lower limits of AFP to a similar degree. The results
   indicate that high water-table level associated with the predomination
   of fine pores in the soil leads to potential risk of restricted aeration

   annual fluctuations in precipitation and high evaporation potentials.
   Water capture is limited by low water infiltration rates because many of
   our soils have relatively small aggregate size distributions, which
   limit infiltration, and are also susceptible to crusting and sealing.
   No-till management has permitted cropping intensification, which via
   improved water storage, has increased crop residue returned to the soil,
   decreased surface bulk density, and increased surface soil porosity. Our
   objective was to quantify the relationship between crop residue biomass
   generated by cropping system intensification and the physical properties
   of the surface soil (0-2.5-cm depth). This study was conducted within an
   existing long-term dryland experiment consisting of three sites in
   eastern Colorado that transect an evapotranspiration gradient. Each site
   transects a soil catena with three distinct soils arranged along a slope
   gradient. Only soils at the summit and toe slopes were sampled for this
   study. Soils are Argiustolls and Ustochrepts. Three no-till cropping
   systems, Wheat-Fallow (WF), Wheat-Corn-Fallow (WCF), and Continuous
   Cropping (CC), were sampled in the summer of 1998 after the cropping
   systems had been in place for 12 years. Bulk density, effective
   porosity, aggregate size distribution, sorptivity, and soil aggregate
   organic C content were measured at the surface 2.5 cm of the soil in

   density was reduced by 0.01 g cm(-3) for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue
   addition over the 12-year period. Each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue
   addition increased effective porosity by 0.3\%. Increases in
   macroaggregation were associated with linear increases in the C content
   of the aggregates; each g kg(-1) of organic C in the macroaggregates
   increased the proportion of macroaggregates by 4.4\%. Implementation of
   no-till intensive cropping systems under this semiarid environment

   weed-suppressive bacteria were compared among seven cropping systems and
   one native-prairie ecosystem in mid-Missouri, USA. Assays of soil
   enzymes (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, dehydrogenase, phosphatase)
   revealed that organic and integrated cropping systems, and the
   native-prairie ecosystem had the highest levels of soil activity. Weed
   rhizospheres from these same ecosystems also had greater proportions of

   detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of
   the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC
   concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference
   in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the
   topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on
   slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer
   by 52.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool
   in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha(-1) compared with
   natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as
   in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse
   impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there
   is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn
   agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard,
   a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to
   achieving sustainable production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   For soils with >60\% clay plus silt, the degree of saturation was
   65-70\% indicating a potential for further organic C and N retention.
   The mean proportion of C and N found in the POM was 22 and 27\%, while
   the LF organic matter contained 7 and 5\% C and N, respectively. Mean
   soil WSA content, determined by wet-sieving analysis, was 42\% for

   in a long fallow agricultural system of the Venezuelan Andes, 32 soil (A
   horizon, 0- 15 cm depth) and litter characteristics were studied in
   plots at different stages of the fallow-cultivation cycle. Four sectors
   of the valley were sampled, each one including seven plots: recently
   ploughed after a long fallow period; 1 and 2 years under potato crop; 1,
   4 5 and 8 years in fallow and natural vegetation. Each sector had
   similar topography, parent material and exposure to reduce the spatial
   heterogeneity that can hinder the synchronic analysis of the succession.
   Data of each sector were standardized before the statistics comparisons.
   Although all soils were acidic, those involved in the cropping cycle, or
   with only 1 year of fallow, had a significantly lower pH than the
   others, indicating that soil cultivation triggered off acidifying
   processes intense enough to overcome the strong buffering indices of the
   soils. These acidifying processes, facilitated by the acidity generating
   ions that widely dominate the desaturated CEC, are surely due to the
   stimulation of litter and soil organic matter mineralization after
   ploughing the soil and also to the N fertilization of the cultivated
   soils. The high soil contents of exchangeable Al3+ and free Al oxides
   suggest that Al plays an important role in SOM stabilization, lowering
   its mineralization. No successional increase of any main plant nutrient
   was found in soil or litter. Moreover, soil available P and litter-P
   contents are higher during the cultivation phase and at the beginning of
   the succession, probably as a consequence of fertilization. Water
   holding capacity was similar for all soils, indicating that this long
   fallow agriculture system does not change the water storage capability
   of the soil, an important aspect for the role of the paramo in the
   regional water balance. The main characteristics of soils and litters,
   including their delta C-13 values, were useless to monitor soil changes
   during cultivation and fallowing. Nevertheless, the delta N-15 values of
   SOM decreased steadily along the crop-fallow chronosequence, while those
   of litterfall were rather constant from recently ploughed to 1 year
   fallow soils, decreasing suddenly on medium fallow, plots and again on
   the virgin paramo. Together, the delta N-15 values of soil- and litter-N
   grouped the soils following the crop-fallow chronosequence, suggesting
   that a change from `open' to `closed' N cycling is the characteristic
   that better discriminates the soils along the succession. (C) 2002

   extractable P), and better biological properties ( greater organic
   carbon (OC), carbon fractions F1 and F3, and more worms) than
   south-eastern Vertosols. When adjusted for clay content, cropped sites
   had less soil OC than pasture sites at 0-75 mm depth. Readily oxidisable
   ( fraction F1) carbon in the surface 75 mm was 3.6 mg/g and 6.9 mg/g
   under long-term pasture compared with 2.5 mg/g and 3.9 mg/g in irrigated

   organic carbon values were positively correlated with physical and
   chemical soil properties. Long-term pasture paddocks showed stronger
   structural development and had smaller aggregates than cropped paddocks,
   which had more larger clods. Vane shear strength and penetration
   resistance were less in rainfed cropped paddocks compared with long-term

   the effects of five plant species on soil aggregate water stability. The
   five species (three grasses, one forb, and a legume) were from the same

   first goal was to test if productivity-related or species-specific

   what the relative importance of the soil protein glomalin (produced by
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF) in soil aggregation is, compared to
   other factors, including AMF hyphal and root length and percent plant
   cover. We found significant differences in soil aggregate water
   stability (1-2 mm size class) for the five plant species examined, and
   corresponding differences in plant cover, root weight and length, AMF
   soil hyphal length, and glomalin concentrations. A structural equation
   modeling approach (path analysis) was used to distinguish direct from
   indirect effects of factors on soil aggregation based on covariance
   structures. Root length, soil glomalin, and percent cover contributed
   equally strong paths to water-stable aggregation. The direct effect of
   glomalin was much stranger than the direct effect of AMF hyphae

   the 1-2-mm size class of aggregates.}},

   could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of
   soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns.
   Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically
   based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions.
   We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative
   indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into
   location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to
   assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter
   management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI.
   Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for
   two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At
   each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices:
   land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets
   were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and
   micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable
   aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity.
   Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest
   set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at
   least 85\% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We
   defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil
   quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess
   sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS
   against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management
   sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal
   contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of
   determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an
   average R(2) = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an
   additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between
   management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low
   rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of
   treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil
   properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed
   indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality
   index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.}},

   the 1979 to 1997 period; namely, fallow-wheat (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat

   all of the available water in the 0-120 cm depth soil profile, but
   lentil extracted about 1.5 cm less water than wheat. On average, wheat
   yield was unaffected by inclusion of lentil in the rotation; however,
   grain protein content was higher in 11 of 18 years. The incidence of
   leaf spotting diseases in wheat was lowest for wheal grown after lentil

   carbon, mineralizable N and C, light fraction organic C, and water
   stable aggregates) increased with cropping intensity in the order of W-L

   compared to fallow-based rotations, including lentil in the rotation
   lowered the energy requirements for N fertilizer and provided an overall
   19\%, reduction in CO2 emissions. The economics favored the W-L system

  abstract = {{Long-term cultivation is known to change soil physical and chemical
   properties, but little is known about whether short-term agricultural
   practices, such as rotational grazing, can initiate such changes. This
   study investigated the impacts of 3 grazing intensities (heavy, medium,
   and light) and 4 forages on selected soil physical and chemical
   parameters of a Typic Haplustoll at Lacombe, Alberta. Measurements were
   conducted on soil samples collected at the beginning (1993) and the end
   (1996) of the study. Two perennial forages, smooth bromegrass (Bromus
   inermis cv. `Carlton') and meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius cv.
   `Paddock'), and 2 annuals, a mixture of triticale (X Triticosecale
   Wittmack cv. `Pika') and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. LAC Lacombe')
   and triticale alone were used for the study. Grazing intensity or forage
   species did not affect carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Grazing intensity
   influenced changes in available water holding capacity for the 0-5 cm
   interval, soil nitrogen for the 30-45 cm interval, soil pH for the 5-15
   cm interval and electrical conductivity for all depth intervals except
   for the 0-5 cm interval (P less than or equal to 0.05). Forage species
   affected changes in soil carbon in the 0-5 cm interval, soil pH between
   0 and 15 cm, and electrical conductivity between 5 and 45 cm (P less
   than or equal to 0.05). Soil electrical conductivities for all grazing
   levels and forage treatments were within the range (i.e. 0-2 dS m(-1))
   considered to have negligible effects on plant growth. The minimal
   effects of grazing and plant species on soil parameters in this study
   may have been due to the resilient intrinsic properties of the sail
   and/or the short study length.}},

   fungi as compared with conventional tillage (CT) systems. In this study,
   we examined six North American agroecosystems with respect to the
   effects of NT vs. CT management systems on the accrual of microbial
   cell-wall residues in surface soil. We used total amino sugar contents
   to estimate living and decomposing microbial cell-wall mass in soil and
   the contents of glucosamine and muramic acid to separate fungal and
   bacterial contributions to microbial-derived soil organic matter (SOM).
   Compared with estimates of glucosamine and muramic acid present in
   living biomass of fungi and bacteria, total concentrations of these
   compounds (745-2076 mg glucosamine kg(-1) soil and 37-79 mg muramic acid
   kg(-1) soil) were larger by factors of 54 to 745 and 26 to 82,
   respectively. At three sites, the ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid
   in NT soils (32.0, 30.0, 42.2) significantly exceeded those in the
   respective CT soils (18.8, 22.1, 23.0) because of a higher enrichment of
   glucosamine. This coincided with higher values for fungal biomass,
   particulate organic matter carbon (POMC), mean weight diameter of
   water-stable aggregates (MWD), and total organic carbon (TOC). Analysis
   of aggregate-size classes showed that the additional glucosamine
   accumulated in >53-mm aggregates but not in smaller particles. The
   enrichment of SOM in fungal-derived glucosamine suggests that the
   accrual of hyphal cell-wall residues is an important process in the
   three NT agroecosystems which leads to higher SOM storage in surface
   soil concurrent with an increase in aggregate stability. The other
   soils, having a lower clay plus silt content, exhibited no significant
   differences in POM-C, MWD, and total amino sugars between NT and CT
   management systems. We suggest that at lower clay plus silt contents the
   beneficial potential for NT to sequester microbial-derived SOM is lower
   because of limited physical stabilization.}},

   gradients to examine the effects of no-tillage (NT) and conventional
   tillage (CT) management on bacterial and fungal abundance and biomass
   and to examine potential controls on the relative abundances of bacteria
   and fungi in these two systems. Samples were divided into 0-5 and 5-20
   cm depth increments and analyzed for bacterial and fungal abundance and
   biomass, total C and N, particulate organic matter C and N (POM-C and
   N), soil water content, texture, pH, and water-stable aggregate
   distributions. Soil moisture, which varied by tillage treatment and
   geographically with climate, ranged from 0.05 to 0.35 g g(-1) dry soil
   in the surface 0-5 cm and 0.15 to 0.28 g g(-1) dry soil at 5-20 cm.
   Measured organic matter C and N fractions and mean weight diameter (MWD)
   of water-stable aggregates were significantly higher in NT relative to
   CT at three of the six sites. Fungal hyphal length ranged from 19 to 292
   m g(-1) soil and was 1.9 to 2.5 times higher in NT compared to CT
   surface soil across all sites. Few significant tillage treatment
   differences in soil physical and chemical properties or in fungal
   abundance and biomass were observed at 5-20 cm. Bacterial abundance and
   biomass were not consistently influenced by tillage treatment or site
   location at either depth. The proportion of the total biomass composed
   of fungi ranged from 10 to 60\% and was significantly higher in NT
   compared to CT surface soil at five of six sites. Proportional fungal
   biomass was not strongly related to soil texture, pH, aggregation, or
   organic C and N fractions, but was positively related to soil moisture
   (r = 0.67; P < 0.001). The relationship between soil moisture and the
   degree of fungal dominance was due to the positive response of fungal
   biomass and the lack of response of bacterial biomass to increasing soil
   moisture across the range of measured soil water contents. Tillage
   treatment effects on fungal biomass and proportional fungal abundance
   were not significant when the data were analyzed by analysis of
   covariance with soil moisture as the covariate. These results suggest
   that observed tillage treatment and climate gradient effects on fungi
   are related to differences in soil moisture. Further research is needed,

   and laboratory techniques, to see how these attributes changed as the

   less in cropping and pyrethrum paddocks than pasture paddocks, and
   microbial biomass C, which was about 60\% less. Earthworm numbers showed
   even greater differences, with virtually no earthworms under pyrethrum.
   Pasture soils had higher shear strength and water contents at the liquid

   subsurface soil. Despite these differences, the absolute values of most
   attributes in cropping paddocks were of a magnitude, which suggests that
   Tasmanian ferrosols even under continuous cropping are still in good
   condition. This agreed with the views of the farmers, obtained by
   individual survey. The decrease in organic C in the cropped soils has
   not decreased the effective cation exchange capacity, probably because
   their higher pH due to liming has compensated. Because ferrosols with
   organic C contents of 1-2\% elsewhere in Australia have been shown to
   have serious management limitations, we need to know by how much the

   can affect sorption and movement of pesticides in soils. In this work,
   we studied the effect of olive oil mill wastewater (OOW) soil amendment
   on soil porosity and on leaching of the herbicides clopyralid
   (3,6-dichloropicolinic acid) and metamitron
   (4-amino-3-methyl-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one) in clay soil
   columns. OOW amendment resulted in an increase in the organic carbon
   content of the soils and a reduction in soil porosity, the latter
   confirmed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) studies. MIP and SEM data showed the reduction in
   porosity is basically due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 0.1
   mu m) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 0.1 mu m).
   These changes in porosity are produced by the combined effect of the
   suspended and soluble organic matter and salts in the OOW and the
   solubilization-insolubilization of the soil carbonate minerals promoted
   by OOW. Soil columns were handpacked with the unamended clay soil and
   with the same soil which had been treated for 3 yrs with two different
   doses of OOW (low dose: 300 ml/m(2) a year and high dose: 600 ml/m(2) a
   year). Clopyralid moved more rapidly than metamitron in the unamended
   soil due to greater sorption and degradation of metamitron. Total
   amounts of clopyralid leached from the OOW amended soils were
   significantly reduced (75 and 25\% for the lower and higher dose,
   respectively) when compared with the unamended soil (100\%), whereas
   metamitron did not leach at all from the amended soils. Sorption and
   degradation studies with soil slurry suggested this reduction may be
   mainly due to an increase in sorption and degradation processes in
   amended soils, as a consequence of the increase in the organic carbon
   content. However the decrease in mobility produced by OOW amendment is
   greater than that suggested from the sorption and degradation increases.
   The reduction in large size conducting pores and the increase in the
   small non-conducting pens, induced by OOW amendment, produce an increase
   in the residence time of the herbicides in the immobile water phase,
   enhancing diffusion, sorption and degradation processes, thereby
   retarding mobility. The retarding effect was more pronounced for
   metamitron than for clopyralid due to the higher sorptivity and
   degradability of the former herbicide. These results suggest the
   possible use of the OOW or similar wastewater amendment in reducing the
   contamination of groundwater by pesticide drainage. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   agricultural lands. An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic
   carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and
   water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect
   the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships
   among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll
   (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression
   procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18
   differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland,
   Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC
   concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates
   obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from
   plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands
   converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63
   were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were
   related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84
   to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and
   WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive
   relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist
   erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs,
   they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby
   reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential
   for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage
   retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance
   surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in
   this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important
   also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls
   such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils. (C) 1997 Published by

   methods and farming systems treatments on soil properties were made from
   1978 through 1987 on agricultural watersheds near Ibadan, southwestern
   Nigeria. These experiments were conducted in two phases: Phase I from
   1978 through 1981 and Phase II from 1983 to 1987, with 1 year (1982) as
   a transition phase when all plots were sown with mucuna (Mucuna utilis).
   There were six treatments in Phase I involving combinations of land
   clearing and tillage methods: (1) manual clearing with no-till (MC-NT);
   (2) manual clearing with plough-till (MC-PT); (3) shear-blade clearing
   with no-till (SB-NT); (4) tree-pusher/root rake clearing with no-till
   (TP-NT); (5) tree-pusher/root-rake clearing with plough-till (TP-PT);
   (6) traditional farming (TF). The six treatments were replicated twice
   in a completely randomized design. The traditional treatment of Phase I
   was discontinued during Phase II. The five farming systems studied
   during Phase II with a no-till system in all treatments were: (1) alley
   cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m
   intervals; (2) and (3) fallowing with Mucuna utilis on severely degraded
   and moderately degraded watersheds, respectively, for 1 year followed by
   maize-cowpea rotation for another; (4) and (5) ley farming involving
   establishment of pasture in the first year on severely and moderately
   degraded plots, respectively, controlled grazing in the second year, and
   growing maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in the third year.
   All treatments, imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, were replicated
   twice. The soil properties analyzed were particle size distribution,
   total aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates, soil bulk
   density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics,
   infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. These
   properties were measured under the forest cover in 1978, and once every
   year during the dry season thereafter during Phases I and II. Prior to
   deforestation, mean soil bulk density was 0.72 Mg m(-3) and 1.30 Mg
   m(-3), soil penetration resistance was 32.4 KPa and 90.7 KPa, and mean
   weight diameter of aggregates was 3.7 mm and 3.2 mm for 0-5 cm and 5-10
   cm depths, respectively. The infiltration rate was excessive (54-334 cm
   hr(-1)) and saturated hydraulic conductivity was rapid (166-499 cm
   hr(-1)) under the forest cover. Furthermore, water transmission
   properties varied significantly even over short distances of about 1 m.
   Deforestation and cultivation increased soil bulk density and
   penetration resistance but decreased mean weight diameter of aggregates.
   One year after deforestation in 1980, mean soil bulk density was 1.41 Mg
   m(-3) for 0-5 cm depth and 1.58 Mg m(-3) for 5-10 cm depth. Soil bulk
   density and penetration resistance were generally higher for NT than for
   PT methods, and the penetration resistance was extremely high in all
   treatments by 1985. During Phase II, soil bulk density was high during
   the grazing cycle of the ley farming treatment. Sand content at 0-5 cm
   depth increased and clay content decreased with cultivation duration.
   Soon after deforestation, saturated hydraulic conductivity and
   equilibrium infiltration rate in cleared and cultivated land declined to
   only 20-30 per cent of that under forest. Mean saturated hydraulic
   conductivity following deforestation was 46.0 cm hr(-1) for 0-5 cm depth
   and 53.
   7 cm hr(-1) for 5-10 cm depth. Further, infiltration rate declined with
   deforestation and cultivation duration in all cropping systems
   treatments. During Phase I, mean infiltration rate was 115.
   8 cm hr(-1) under forest cover in 1978, 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1979, 17.4 cm
   hr(-1) in 1980 and 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1981. During Phase II, mean
   infiltration rate was 8.5 cm hr(-1) in 1982, 11.9 cm hr(-1) in 1983,
   11.0 cm hr(-1) in 1984, 11.3 cm hr(-1) in 1985 and 5.3 cm hr(-1) in
   1986. Infiltration rate was generally high in ley farming and mucuna
   fallowing treatments. Natural fallowing drastically improved the
   infiltration rate from 19.2 cm hr(-1) in 1982 to 193.2 cm hr(-1) in
   1986, a ten-fold increase within 5 years of fallowing. High-energy soil
   water retention characteristics in Phase I were affected by those
   treatments that caused soil compaction by mechanized clearing and
   no-till systems. Soil water retention at 0.01 MPa potential in 1979 was
   19.2 per cent (gravimetrics) for SE, 17.9 per cent for TP, 15.9 per cent
   for MC and 17.8 per cent for TF methods. With regards to tillage, soil
   water retention was 17.8 per cent for NT compared with 16.8 per cent for
   PT. During Phase II, water retention characteristics were not affected
   by the farming system treatments. Mean soil water retention (average of
   4 years' data from 1982 to 1986) at 0.01 MPa for 0-5 cm depth was 16.6
   per cent for alley cropping, 16.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing and 16.8
   per cent for ley farming. Mean soil water retention for 1.5 MPa suction
   was 9.3 per cent for alley cropping, 8.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing,
   and 9.3 per cent for ley farming. Water retention at 1.5 MPa suction
   correlated with the clay and soil organic carbon content.}},

   ICM systems resulted in a 1 week earlier peak yield compared to the CON
   system. The yield of No. 1 fruit was 55\% to 60\% greater in the BLD+
   system than the other three systems, which were comparable in yield. Net
   return was highest in the BLD+ system, although the benefit/cost ratio
   was greatest in the CON system. This multidisciplinary study has
   identified important differences in the performance of diverse
   production systems during the unique transitional season.}},

  abstract = {{Conventional management practices have been associated with increased
   soil erosion and organic matter loss and the contamination of surface
   and ground water. Alternative agriculture systems which minimize
   external chemical inputs and degradation of soil and water resources
   represent alternatives to conventional management practices. Four
   different management practices were compared on an alluvial silty loam
   soil cultivated to grow corn (Zea mays L.). The effects of conventional
   and reduced tillage and of different chemical inputs on the distribution
   of phosphorus (P) concentration and on soil porosity were investigated.
   Results showed that the highest P content was detected in the topsoil
   (0-10 cm) of the minimum tilled plots even though the amount of P
   fertilizer added was much lower than the amount added in the
   conventionally tilled plots. The total porosity was significantly higher
   in the minimum tilled soil and was related only to the tillage
   technique. Since the higher porosity was mainly due to the higher
   proportion of elongated and regular pores, the minimum tilled soil
   appeared to be more resistant to physical stresses and characterized by
   a higher biological activity.}},

  abstract = {{Four treatments (control, chemical fertilizer, wheat straw, and wheat
   straw + fertilizer) were established on the dryland experimental farm of
   the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University.
   Organic C in the different treatments ranged from 0.69 to 0.93\%, total
   N from 0.08 to 0.11\%, and total P from 0.018 to 0.021. The application
   of straw significantly increased the soil water-holding capacity. The
   maximum effect on the microbial biomass was realized with the straw +
   fertilizer treatment, followed by straw and then by the fertilizer
   treatment. During the study microbial biomass C ranged from 144 to 491
   mug g-1 dry soil, biomass N from 14.6 to 50.1 mug g-1, and biomass P
   from 7.2 to 17.6 mug g-1 soil. Microbial biomass C, N and P represented
   3.2-4.6\% of total C, 2.6-3.8\% of total N, and 5.8-8.2\% of total P in
   the soil, respectively, in all cases the highest proportion occurred in
   the straw+fertilizer treatment and the lowest in the control. Microbial
   biomass C, N, and P were positively correlated with each other.
   Microbial biomass C and N increased by 77\% in straw+fertilizer-treated
   plots relative to the control. The increase in microbial biomass P in
   the straw+fertilizer treatment over the control was 81\%. The increase
   in the microbial biomass is expected to enhance nutrient availability in
   the soil, as the microbial biomass acts both as a sink and a source of
   plant nutrients.}},
